"Distress Disclosure across Social Media Platforms during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Untangling the Effects of Platforms, Affordances, and Audiences","Understanding how and why people share negative emotions and thoughts on social media has received much scholarly attention. Scholars have identified a variety of factors that affect disclosure behavior, but as platforms offer a wider range of affordances that enable more diverse user behaviors and nuanced audience segmentation, these influencing factors are increasingly intertwined. However, little is known about the interrelatedness of platform, affordance, and audience. Drawing on survey data of 470 American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examines the interplay and relative strength of the factors influencing distress disclosure on social media. We introduce the concept of social media disclosure ecology as an analytical lens to understand online disclosure. The results suggest that perceived affordances (i.e., anonymity, persistence, visibility control) and relational closeness to audience separately and interactively predict the depth of distress disclosure, which in turn affects satisfaction with disclosure. This study contributes to the literature on online-disclosure and privacy, while providing implications for the design of social media to better support people in distress.","Social media platforms can encourage people to share negative emotions and thoughts, potentially leading to over-sharing and dissatisfaction with the disclosure.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445134,Social Media,CHI,user experience
The Right to Help and the Right Help: Fostering and Regulating Collective Action in a Medical Making Reaction to COVID-19,"Medical making intersects opposing value systems of a medical “do no harm” ethos and makers’ drive to innovate. Since March 2020, online maker communities have formed to design, manufacture, and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical devices needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a participant observation study of 14 maker communities, which have developed differing driving principles for efforts with varied access to interdisciplinary expertise on online platforms that mutually shape collective action. Over time, these communities unintentionally align towards action-oriented or regulated practices because they often lack higher level insight and agency in choosing communication platforms. In response, we recommend: regulatory bodies to build coalitions with makers, online platforms to give communities more control over the presentation of information, and repositories to balance needs to distribute information while limiting the spread of misinformation.","
The article highlights how online maker communities, despite their good intentions to innovate and help during the COVID-19 pandemic, may unintentionally align towards action-oriented or regulated practices due to a lack of interdisciplinary expertise and insight. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and unreliable medical devices, posing a risk to public health and safety.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445707,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Empowering Dyads of Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment And Their Care Partners Using Conversational Agents,"Conversational agents (CAs) such as Google Home or Alexa offer empowering opportunities for dyads composed of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their care partners. CAs support coordination and planning between the two, and can amplify the support that the care partner needs to provide. In this study, we observed how ten such dyads interacted with a Google Home over 10 weeks. We logged and analyzed 3,878 total interactions, interviewed the dyads to better understand their experiences, and also surveyed their individual preferences and priorities for automated assistance in the home. We found that CAs empowered both the people who had MCI, and their care partners. We observed that the utility of the CA in the day-to-day lives of users largely depended on how much the care partner scaffolded promising functionality, setting it up and contextualizing it for specific needs and desires.","

The study found that the effectiveness of the Conversational Agents (CAs) in improving the lives of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their care partners depends on the care partner's ability to set up and contextualize the technology for specific needs and desires. This means that the care partner must invest time and effort in learning how to use the technology and tailoring it to the individual's needs, which can be burdensome and may not be feasible for all care partners.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445124,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
ARTEMIS: A Collaborative Mixed-Reality System for Immersive Surgical Telementoring,"Traumatic injuries require timely intervention, but medical expertise is not always available at the patient’s location. Despite recent advances in telecommunications, surgeons still have limited tools to remotely help inexperienced surgeons. Mixed Reality hints at a future where remote collaborators work side-by-side as if co-located; however, we still do not know how current technology can improve remote surgical collaboration. Through role-playing and iterative-prototyping, we identify collaboration practices used by expert surgeons to aid novice surgeons as well as technical requirements to facilitate these practices. We then introduce ARTEMIS, an AR-VR collaboration system that supports these key practices. Through an observational study with two expert surgeons and five novice surgeons operating on cadavers, we find that ARTEMIS supports remote surgical mentoring of novices through synchronous point, draw, and look affordances and asynchronous video clips. Most participants found that ARTEMIS facilitates collaboration despite existing technology limitations explored in this paper.","

The article highlights the potential for Augmented/Virtual Reality technology to improve remote surgical collaboration, but also notes that there are still limitations to the technology that need to be addressed. One of the undesirable consequences of relying on this technology is that it may not always be available or reliable, particularly in emergency situations where timely intervention is critical. Additionally, the technology may not be able to fully replicate the benefits of in-person collaboration, potentially leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could compromise patient care.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445576,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Exploring Generative Models with Middle School Students,"Applications of generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made their way to social media platforms that children frequently interact with. While GANs are associated with ethical implications pertaining to children, such as the generation of Deepfakes, there are negligible efforts to educate middle school children about generative AI. In this work, we present a generative models learning trajectory (LT), educational materials, and interactive activities for young learners with a focus on GANs, creation and application of machine-generated media, and its ethical implications. The activities were deployed in four online workshops with 72 students (grades 5-9). We found that these materials enabled children to gain an understanding of what generative models are, their technical components and potential applications, and benefits and harms, while reflecting on their ethical implications. Learning from our findings, we propose an improved learning trajectory for complex socio-technical systems.","Children are exposed to harmful content and lack education on ethical implications of AI technology, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can be used to create Deepfakes and other harmful media.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445226,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Can a Humorous Conversational Agent Enhance Learning Experience and Outcomes?,"Previous studies have highlighted the benefits of pedagogical conversational agents using socially-oriented conversation with students. In this work, we examine the effects of a conversational agent’s use of affiliative and self-defeating humour — considered conducive to social well-being and enhancing interpersonal relationships — on learners’ perception of the agent and attitudes towards the task. Using a between-subjects protocol, 58 participants taught a conversational agent about rock classification using a learning-by-teaching platform, the Curiosity Notebook. While all agents were curious and enthusiastic, the style of humour was manipulated such that the agent either expressed an affiliative style, a self-defeating style, or no humour. Results demonstrate that affiliative humour can significantly increase motivation and effort, while self-defeating humour, although enhancing effort, negatively impacts enjoyment. Findings further highlight the importance of understanding learner characteristics when using humour.","

“They think it’s totally fine to talk to somebody on the internet they don’t know”: Teachers’ perceptions and mitigation strategies of tweens’ online risks,"Teachers play a key role in educating children about digital security and privacy. They are often at the forefront, witnessing incidents, dealing with the consequences, and helping children handle the technology-related risks. However, little is reported about teachers’ lived classroom experiences and their challenges in this regard. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 Canadian elementary school teachers to understand the risks teachers witness children aged 10–13 facing on digital media, teachers’ mitigation strategies, and how prepared teachers are to help children. Our results show that teachers regularly help children deal with digital risks outside of teaching official curriculum, ranging from minor privacy violations to severe cases of cyberbullying. Most issues reported by teachers were the result of typical behaviours which became risky because they took place over digital media. We use the results to highlight implications for how elementary schools address digital security and privacy.","Teachers are not adequately prepared to help children handle technology-related risks, such as cyberbullying and privacy violations, that arise from children's use of digital media.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445224,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"Prototyping for Social Wellbeing with Early Social Media Users: Belonging, Experimentation, and Self-Care","Many 10-14 year olds are at the early stages of using social media, habits they develop on popular platforms can have lasting effects on their socio-emotional wellbeing. We led a remote innovation workshop with 23 middle schoolers on digital wellbeing, identity exploration, and computational concepts related to social computing. This workshop was a unique opportunity to reflect on emergent habits, discuss them with peers, and imagine oneself as an ICT innovator. Resulting themes related to participants’ social wellbeing online included a) sense of belonging to communities of interest, friends, and family, b) self-care and social support strategies involving managing risks, control, and empathy, and c) experimentation while building self-confidence and bravely exploring audience reactions. Participants iteratively designed and tested a sandbox social network website, resulting in Social Sketch. Reflecting on our study, we describe the process for conceptualizing Social Sketch, and challenges in social media innovation with teenagers.","

‘Unmochon’: A Tool to Combat Online Sexual Harassment over Facebook Messenger,"Women in the global south often seek justice to their online harassment through unveiling the harassers and the screenshots of their sent harassment texts and visual contents before the relevant authorities. Nevertheless, such evidence is often challenged for their authenticity. Our survey (n=91) and interview (n=43) with Bangladeshi online gender harassment victims revealed the depth of the problem, and we set design goals to collect evidence from Facebook Messenger with ensured authenticity. Building on the ‘shame-based model’ of gender justice [12], we designed ‘Unmochon’, a tool that captures authentic evidence and shares with victims’ intended group. Our user-study (n=48) revealed that diminishing authenticity problem may still leave the victim and online gender justice entangled with mob-sentiment, hegemonic legal consciousness, and several privacy aspects. Our findings open up a new discussion on how HCI-design should address online gender justice in such a complex social setting.","Online harassment of women in the global south is often difficult to prove due to challenges in authenticating evidence, which can leave victims vulnerable and without justice.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445154,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Fragments of the Past: Curating Peer Support with Perpetrators of Domestic Violence,"There is growing evidence that digital peer-support networks can have a positive influence on behaviour change and wellbeing outcomes for people who harm themselves and others. However, making and sustaining such networks are subject to ethical and pragmatic challenges, particularly for perpetrators of domestic violence whom pose unique risks when brought together. In this work we report on a ten-month study where we worked with six support workers and eighteen perpetrators in the design and deployment of Fragments of the Past; a socio-material system that connects audio messages with tangible artefacts. We share how crafting digitally-augmented artefacts - ‘fragments’ - of experiences of desisting from violence can translate messages for motivation and rapport between peers, without subjecting the process to risks inherent with direct inter-personal communication. These insights provide the basis for practical considerations for future network design with challenging populations.","

Bringing the Jury to the Scene of the Crime: Memory and Decision-Making in a Simulated Crime Scene,"This paper investigates the use of immersive virtual reconstructions as an aid for jurors during a courtroom trial. The findings of a between-participant user study on memory and decision-making are presented in the context of viewing a simulated hit-run-death scenario. Participants listened to the opening statement of a prosecutor and a defence attorney before viewing the crime scene in Virtual Reality (VR) or as still images. We compare the effects on cognition and usability of using VR over images presented on a screen. We found several significant improvements, including that VR led to more consistent decision-making among participants. This shows that VR could provide a promising solution for the court to present crime scenes when site visitations are not possible.","

The use of Virtual Reality technology in courtroom trials could lead to more consistent decision-making among jurors, potentially leading to a lack of diverse perspectives and critical thinking.

The Effects of System Interpretation Errors on Learning New Input Mechanisms,"Input mechanisms can produce noisy signals that computers must interpret, and this interpretation can misconstrue the user’s intention. Researchers have studied how interpretation errors can affect users’ task performance, but little is known about how these errors affect learning, and whether they help or hinder the transition to expertise. Previous findings suggest that increasing the user’s attention can facilitate learning, so frequent interpretation errors may increase attention and learning; alternatively, however, interpretation errors may negatively interfere with skill development. To explore these potentially important effects, we conducted studies where participants learned commands with various rates of artificially injected interpretation errors. Our results showed that higher rates of interpretation error led to worse memory retention, higher completion times, higher occurrences of user error (beyond those injected by the system), and greater perceived effort. These findings indicate that when input mechanisms must interpret the user’s input, interpretation errors cause problems for user learning.","Interpretation errors in voice assistants can hinder learning and skill development, leading to worse memory retention, higher completion times, higher occurrences of user error, and greater perceived effort.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445366,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
A User-Oriented Approach to Space-Adaptive Augmentation: The Effects of Spatial Affordance on Narrative Experience in an Augmented Reality Detective Game,"Space-adaptive algorithms aim to effectively align the virtual with the real to provide immersive user experiences for Augmented Reality(AR) content across various physical spaces. While such measures are reliant on real spatial features, efforts to understand those features from the user’s perspective and reflect them in designing adaptive augmented spaces have been lacking. For this, we compared factors of narrative experience in six spatial conditions during the gameplay of Fragments, a space-adaptive AR detective game. Configured by size and furniture layout, each condition afforded disparate degrees of traversability and visibility. Results show that whereas centered furniture clusters are suitable for higher presence in sufficiently large rooms, the same layout leads to lower narrative engagement. Based on our findings, we suggest guidelines that can enhance the effects of space adaptivity by considering how users perceive and navigate augmented space generated from different physical environments.","

The article highlights the risk of designing AR spaces that do not take into account the user's perspective, leading to a disconnect between the virtual and real environments. This can result in a decrease in narrative engagement and a less immersive experience for the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445675,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Augmented Reality and Older Adults: A Comparison of Prompting Types,"Older adults can benefit from technologies that help them to complete everyday tasks. However, they are an often-under-represented population in augmented reality (AR) research. We present the results of a study in which people aged 50 years or older were asked to perform actions by interpreting visual AR prompts in a lab setting. Our results show that users were less successful at completing actions when using ARROW and HIGHLIGHT augmentations than when using ghosted OBJECT or GHOSTHAND augmentations. We found that user confidence in performing actions varied according to action and augmentation type. Users preferred combined AUDIO+TEXT prompts (our control condition) overall, but the GHOSTHAND was the most preferred visual prompt. We discuss reasons for these differences and provide insight for developers of AR content for older adults. Our work provides the first comparative study of AR with older adults in a non-industrial context.","Older adults may struggle with certain types of augmented reality prompts, leading to lower success rates and confidence in completing tasks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445476,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Assisting Manipulation and Grasping in Robot Teleoperation with Augmented Reality Visual Cues,"Teleoperating industrial manipulators in co-located spaces can be challenging. Facilitating robot teleoperation by providing additional visual information about the environment and the robot affordances using augmented reality (AR), can improve task performance in manipulation and grasping. In this paper, we present two designs of augmented visual cues, that aim to enhance the visual space of the robot operator through hints about the position of the robot gripper in the workspace and in relation to the target. These visual cues aim to improve the distance perception and thus, the task performance. We evaluate both designs against a baseline in an experiment where participants teleoperate a robotic arm to perform pick-and-place tasks. Our results show performance improvements in different levels, reflecting in objective and subjective measures with trade-offs in terms of time, accuracy, and participants’ views of teleoperation. These findings show the potential of AR not only in teleoperation, but in understanding the human-robot workspace.","

Over-reliance on technology can lead to decreased human performance and skills in certain tasks, as people may become too dependent on augmented reality cues and neglect their own abilities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445398,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Augmented Reality Glasses as an Orientation and Mobility Aid for People with Low Vision: a Feasibility Study of Experiences and Requirements,"People with low vision experience reduced mobility that affects their physical and mental wellbeing. With augmented reality (AR) glasses, there are new opportunities to provide visual and auditory information that can improve mobility for this vulnerable group. Current research into AR-based mobility aids has focused mainly on the technical aspects, and less emphasis has been placed on understanding the usability and suitability of these aids in people with various levels of visual impairment. In this paper, we present the results of qualitative interviews with 18 participants using HoloLens v1 and eight prototype augmentations to understand how these enhancements are perceived by people with low vision and how these aids should be adjusted to suit their needs. Our results suggested that participants with moderate vision loss could potentially perceive the most benefit from glasses and underlined the importance of extensive customizability to accommodate the needs of a highly varied low vision population.","

The article highlights the potential for Augmented Reality (AR) technology to improve mobility for people with low vision, but also notes that there has been less emphasis on understanding the usability and suitability of these aids for people with various levels of visual impairment. This suggests that while AR technology may offer benefits, it may not be tailored to the needs of all users, particularly those with moderate vision loss, and may require extensive customization to be effective.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445327,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Exploring Augmented Visual Alterations in Interpersonal Communication,"Augmented Reality (AR) glasses equip users with the tools to modify the visual appearance of their surrounding environment. This might severely impact interpersonal communication, as the conversational partners will no longer share the same visual perception of reality. Grounded in color-in-context theory, we present a potential AR application scenario in which users can modify the color of the environment to achieve subconscious benefits. In a consecutive online survey (N=64), we measured the user’s comfort, acceptance of altering and being altered, and how it is impacted by being able to perceive or not perceive the alteration. We identified significant differences depending on (1) who or what is the target of the alteration, (2) which body part is altered, and (3) which relationship the conversational partners share. In light of our quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss ethical and practical implications for future devices and applications that employ visual alterations.","Augmented Reality technology can negatively impact interpersonal communication by altering the visual perception of reality, leading to differences in comfort, acceptance, and trust between conversational partners.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445597,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Crowdsourcing Design Guidance for Contextual Adaptation of Text Content in Augmented Reality,"Augmented Reality (AR) can deliver engaging user experiences that seamlessly meld virtual content with the physical environment. However, building such experiences is challenging due to the developer’s inability to assess how uncontrolled deployment contexts may influence the user experience. To address this issue, we demonstrate a method for rapidly conducting AR experiments and real-world data collection in the user’s own physical environment using a privacy-conscious mobile web application. The approach leverages the large number of distinct user contexts accessible through crowdsourcing to efficiently source diverse context and perceptual preference data. The insights gathered through this method complement emerging design guidance and sample-limited lab-based studies. The utility of the method is illustrated by re-examining the design challenge of adapting AR text content to the user’s environment. Finally, we demonstrate how gathered design insight can be operationalized to provide adaptive text content functionality in an AR headset.","

The use of AR technology can lead to a lack of privacy for users, as their personal information and physical environment can be collected and accessed by developers through crowdsourcing. This can result in a loss of control over personal data and potentially dangerous consequences, such as identity theft or stalking. Additionally, the use of AR technology can also lead to a decrease in the accuracy of the information presented, as the technology relies on user-generated content and may not be verifiable.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445493,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Gaze-Supported 3D Object Manipulation in Virtual Reality,"This paper investigates integration, coordination, and transition strategies of gaze and hand input for 3D object manipulation in VR. Specifically, this work aims to understand whether incorporating gaze input can benefit VR object manipulation tasks, and how it should be combined with hand input for improved usability and efficiency. We designed four gaze-supported techniques that leverage different combination strategies for object manipulation and evaluated them in two user studies. Overall, we show that gaze did not offer significant performance benefits for transforming objects in the primary working space, where all objects were located in front of the user and within the arm-reach distance, but can be useful for a larger environment with distant targets. We further offer insights regarding combination strategies of gaze and hand input, and derive implications that can help guide the design of future VR systems that incorporate gaze input for 3D object manipulation.","

* Incorporating gaze input in VR object manipulation tasks may not offer significant performance benefits for objects within arm-reach distance.
* Users may not benefit from gaze input in VR for objects that are located in front of them and within arm-reach distance.
* Gaze input may be useful for objects that are located at a distance, but this may not be applicable for objects that are within arm-reach.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445343,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Touch&Fold: A Foldable Haptic Actuator for Rendering Touch in Mixed Reality,"We propose a nail-mounted foldable haptic device that provides tactile feedback to mixed reality (MR) environments by pressing against the user's fingerpad when a user touches a virtual object. What is novel in our device is that it quickly tucks away when the user interacts with real-world objects. Its design allows it to fold back on top of the user's nail when not in use, keeping the user's fingerpad free to, for instance, manipulate handheld tools and other objects while in MR. To achieve this, we engineered a wireless and self-contained haptic device, which measures 24×24×41 mm and weighs 9.5 g. Furthermore, our foldable end-effector also features a linear resonant actuator, allowing it to render not only touch contacts (i.e., pressure) but also textures (i.e., vibrations). We demonstrate how our device renders contacts with MR surfaces, buttons, low- and high-frequency textures. In our first user study, we found that participants perceived our device to be more realistic than a previous haptic device that also leaves the fingerpad free (i.e., fingernail vibration). In our second user study, we investigated the participants’ experience while using our device in a real-world task that involved physical objects. We found that our device allowed participants to use the same finger to manipulate handheld tools, small objects, and even feel textures and liquids, without much hindrance to their dexterity, while feeling haptic feedback when touching MR interfaces.","

The device may hinder the user's dexterity when manipulating real-world objects, as it takes up space on the user's finger and may interfere with their ability to grasp and handle small objects. Additionally, the device may be distracting or disruptive to the user's experience in MR environments, as it provides tactile feedback that may not be necessary or desirable in all situations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445099,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"StickyPie: A Gaze-Based, Scale-Invariant Marking Menu Optimized for AR/VR","This work explores the design of marking menus for gaze-based AR/VR menu selection by expert and novice users. It first identifies and explains the challenges inherent in ocular motor control and current eye tracking hardware, including overshooting, incorrect selections, and false activations. Through three empirical studies, we optimized and validated design parameters to mitigate these errors while reducing completion time, task load, and eye fatigue. Based on the findings from these studies, we derived a set of design guidelines to support gaze-based marking menus in AR/VR. To overcome the overshoot errors found with eye-based expert marking menu behaviour, we developed StickyPie, a marking menu technique that enables scale-independent marking input by estimating saccade landing positions. An evaluation of StickyPie revealed that StickyPie was easier to learn than the traditional technique (i.e., RegularPie) and was 10% more efficient after 3 sessions.","

* Overshooting, incorrect selections, and false activations in gaze-based AR/VR menu selection due to limitations in ocular motor control and current eye tracking hardware.
* Eye fatigue and increased task load due to inefficient design of marking menus.

Radi-Eye: Hands-Free Radial Interfaces for 3D Interaction using Gaze-Activated Head-Crossing,"Eye gaze and head movement are attractive for hands-free 3D interaction in head-mounted displays, but existing interfaces afford only limited control. Radi-Eye is a novel pop-up radial interface designed to maximise expressiveness with input from only the eyes and head. Radi-Eye provides widgets for discrete and continuous input and scales to support larger feature sets. Widgets can be selected with Look & Cross, using gaze for pre-selection followed by head-crossing as trigger and for manipulation. The technique leverages natural eye-head coordination where eye and head move at an offset unless explicitly brought into alignment, enabling interaction without risk of unintended input. We explore Radi-Eye in three augmented and virtual reality applications, and evaluate the effect of radial interface scale and orientation on performance with Look & Cross. The results show that Radi-Eye provides users with fast and accurate input while opening up a new design space for hands-free fluid interaction.","

The use of eye gaze and head movement for hands-free interaction in virtual reality technology can lead to unintended inputs, as the system may misinterpret natural eye and head movements as commands.

Communication Skills Training Intervention Based on Automated Recognition of Nonverbal Signals,"There have been promising studies that show a potential of providing social signal feedback to improve communication skills. However, these studies have primarily focused on unimodal methods of feedback. In addition to this, studies do not assess whether skills are maintained after a given time. With a sample size of 22 this paper investigates whether multimodal social signal feedback is an effective method of improving communication in the context of media interviews. A pre-post experimental evaluation of media skills training intervention is presented which compares standard feedback with augmented feedback based on automated recognition of multimodal social signals. Results revealed significantly different training effects between the two conditions. However, the initial experiment study failed to show significant differences in human judgement of performance. A 6-month follow-up study revealed human judgement ratings were higher for the experiment group. This study suggests that augmented selective multimodal social signal feedback is an effective method for communication skills training.","

The study found that the use of multimodal social signal feedback in communication skills training resulted in significantly different training effects between the two conditions, but the initial experiment study failed to show significant differences in human judgment of performance. This suggests that the use of augmented reality technology may not always be effective in improving communication skills, and may even lead to negative outcomes if not implemented properly. Additionally, the study only showed positive results after a 6-month follow-up, indicating that the technology may not have immediate benefits and may require long-term use to see positive effects. This raises concerns about the feasibility and practicality of using augmented reality technology for communication skills training.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445324,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
HoloBar: Rapid Command Execution for Head-Worn AR Exploiting Around the Field-of-View Interaction,"Inefficient menu interfaces lead to system and application commands being tedious to execute in Immersive Environments. HoloBar is a novel approach to ease the interaction with multi-level menus in immersive environments: with HoloBar, the hierarchical menu splits between the field of view (FoV) of the Head Mounted Display and the smartphone (SP). Command execution is based on around-the-FoV interaction with the SP, and touch input on the SP display. The HoloBar offers a unique combination of features, namely rapid mid-air activation, implicit selection of top-level items and preview of second-level items on the SP, ensuring rapid access to commands. In a first study we validate its activation method, which consists in bringing the SP within an activation distance from the FoV. In a second study, we compare the HoloBar to two alternatives, including the standard HoloLens menu. Results show that the HoloBar shortens each step of a multi-level menu interaction (menu activation, top-level item selection, second-level item selection and validation), with a high success rate. A follow-up study confirms that these results remain valid when compared with the two validation mechanisms of HoloLens (Air-Tap and clicker).","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can lead to inefficient menu interfaces, making it tedious to execute system and application commands. This can result in users experiencing frustration and wasting time trying to navigate through menus, ultimately leading to a negative experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445255,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Making Space for Social Sharing: Insights from a Community-Based Social Group for People with Dementia,"People with dementia face major challenges in maintaining active social interaction. Designing digital tools for social sharing within families and care facilities has been well explored by HCI research, but comparatively less work has considered community settings. Situated in a community-based program for storytelling and socializing, our field observations and semi-structured interviews with people living with early-middle stage dementia, family caregivers, and program facilitators illustrate both positive and challenging aspects of social activities. We contribute a nuanced understanding of participants' social lives and identify four factors that aid in achieving positive outcomes: effective agencies for social interaction, normalized and friendly environments, collaboration and teamwork, and mediating social cues and communication. Finally, we examine our findings through the lens of past HCI work and offer insights for designing new social technologies to diversify the range of social spaces in community settings, through expanding peer collaboration, leveraging physical and virtual spaces, creating open-ended experiences, and developing flexible platforms.","Social Media can lead to isolation and decreased social interaction for individuals with dementia, making it difficult for them to maintain active social lives and connect with others in community settings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376133,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Mouillé: Exploring Wetness Illusion on Fingertips to Enhance Immersive Experience in VR,"Providing users with rich sensations is beneficial to enhance their immersion in Virtual Reality (VR) environments. Wetness is one such imperative sensation that affects users' sense of comfort and helps users adjust grip force when interacting with objects. Researchers have recently begun to explore ways to create wetness illusions, primarily on a user's face or body skin. In this work, we extended this line of research by creating wetness illusion on users' fingertips. We first conducted a user study to understand the effect of thermal and tactile feedback on users' perceived wetness sensation. Informed by the findings, we designed and evaluated a prototype---Mouillé---that provides various levels of wetness illusions on fingertips for both hard and soft items when users squeeze, lift, or scratch it. Study results indicated that users were able to feel wetness with different levels of temperature changes and they were able to distinguish three levels of wetness for simulated VR objects. We further presented applications that simulated an ice cube, an iced cola bottle, and a wet sponge, etc, to demonstrate its use in VR.","Users may become too reliant on technology to provide sensory experiences, leading to a decrease in their ability to perceive and appreciate real-world sensations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376138,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Replicate and Reuse: Tangible Interaction Design for Digitally-Augmented Physical Media Objects,"Technology has transformed our physical interactions into infinitely more scalable and flexible digital ones. We can peruse an infinite number of photos, news articles, and books. However, these digital experiences lack the physical experience of paging through an album, reading a newspaper, or meandering through a bookshelf. Overlaying physical objects with digital content using augmented reality is a promising avenue towards bridging this gap. In this paper, we investigate the interaction design for such digital-overlaid physical objects and their varying levels of tangibility. We first conduct a user evaluation of a physical photo album that uses tangible interactions to support physical and digital operations. We further prototype multiple objects including bookshelves and newspapers and probe users on their usage, capabilities, and interactions. We then conduct a qualitative investigation of three interaction designs with varying tangibility that use three different input modalities. Finally, we discuss the insights from our investigations and recommend design guidelines.","

The overuse of digital technology, such as augmented reality, can lead to a decrease in physical interactions and a loss of tangible experiences, which are important for human connection and well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376139,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Breaking The Experience: Effects of Questionnaires in VR User Studies,"Questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (VR) evaluations and user studies. However, transitioning from virtual worlds to the physical world to respond to VR experience questionnaires can potentially lead to systematic biases. Administering questionnaires in VR (inVRQs) is becoming more common in contemporary research. This is based on the intuitive notion that inVRQs may ease participation, reduce the Break in Presence (BIP) and avoid biases. In this paper, we perform a systematic investigation into the effects of interrupting the VR experience through questionnaires using physiological data as a continuous and objective measure of presence. In a user study (n=50), we evaluated question-asking procedures using a VR shooter with two different levels of immersion. The users rated their player experience with a questionnaire either inside or outside of VR. Our results indicate a reduced BIP for the employed inVRQ without affecting the self-reported player experience.",Interrupting VR experience with questionnaires can reduce presence and affect user experience.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376144,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"""Hey Model!""  Natural User Interactions and Agency in Accessible Interactive 3D Models","While developments in 3D printing have opened up opportunities for improved access to graphical information for people who are blind or have low vision (BLV), they can provide only limited detailed and contextual information. Interactive 3D printed models (I3Ms) that provide audio labels and/or a conversational agent interface potentially overcome this limitation. We conducted a Wizard-of-Oz exploratory study to uncover the multi-modal interaction techniques that BLV people would like to use when exploring I3Ms, and investigated their attitudes towards different levels of model agency. These findings informed the creation of an I3M prototype of the solar system. A second user study with this model revealed a hierarchy of interaction, with BLV users preferring tactile exploration, followed by touch gestures to trigger audio labels, and then natural language to fill in knowledge gaps and confirm understanding.","

The use of conversational agents and audio labels in interactive 3D printed models (I3Ms) may lead to a reliance on auditory information, potentially neglecting the development of tactile exploration skills for people who are blind or have low vision. This could result in a loss of independence for these individuals, as they may become reliant on technology to navigate their surroundings rather than relying on their own senses. Additionally, over-reliance on technology may lead to a decrease in the development of other important skills, such as spatial awareness and problem-solving abilities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376145,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
Meta-AR-App: An Authoring Platform for Collaborative Augmented Reality in STEM Classrooms,"Augmented Reality (AR) has become a valuable tool for education and training processes. Meanwhile, cloud-based technologies can foster collaboration and other interaction modalities to enhance learning. We combine the cloud capabilities with AR technologies to present Meta-AR-App, an authoring platform for collaborative AR, which enables authoring between instructors and students. Additionally, we introduce a new application of an established collaboration process, the pull-based development model, to enable sharing and retrieving of AR learning content. We customize this model and create two modalities of interaction for the classroom: local (student to student) and global (instructor to class) pull. Based on observations from our user studies, we organize a four-category classroom model which implements our system: Work, Design, Collaboration, and Technology. Further, our system enables an iterative improvement workflow of the class content and enables synergistic collaboration that empowers students to be active agents in the learning process.",Over-reliance on technology in education can lead to decreased face-to-face interaction and social skills among students.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376146,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Proximate Social Factors in First-Time Contribution to Online Communities,"In the course of every member's integration into an online community, a decision must be made to participate for the first time. The challenges of effective recruitment, management, and retention of new users have been extensively explored in social computing research. However, little work has looked at in-the-moment factors that lead users to decide to participate instead of ""lurk"", conditions which can be shaped to draw new users in at crucial moments. In this work we analyze 183 million messages scraped from chatrooms on the livestreaming platform Twitch in order to understand differences between first-time participants' and regulars' behaviors and to identify conditions that encourage first-time participation. We find that presence of diverse types of users increases likelihood of new participation, with effects depending on the size of the community. We also find that information-seeking behaviors in first-time participation are negatively associated with retention in the short and medium term.","Social media platforms can make it difficult for new users to participate and engage with the community, leading to a negative impact on retention.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376151,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Exploring Auditory Information to Change Users' Perception of Time Passing as Shorter,"Although the processing speed of computers has been drastically increasing year by year, users still have to wait for computers to complete tasks or to respond. To cope with this, several studies have proposed presenting certain visual information to users to change their perception of time passing as shorter, e.g., progress bars with animated ribbing or faster/slower virtual clocks. As speech interfaces such as smart speakers are becoming popular, a novel method is required to make users perceive the passing of time as shorter by presenting auditory stimuli. We thus prepared 20 pieces of auditory information as experimental stimuli; that is, 11 auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration but different numbers of 0.1-second sine-wave sounds and 9 other auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration and numbers of sounds but different interval patterns between the sounds. We conducted three experiments to figure out which kinds of auditory stimuli can change users' perception of time passing as shorter. We found that a 10.1-second auditory stimulus that has 0.1-second sine-wave sounds appearing 11 times with intervals between the sounds that narrow rapidly in a linear fashion was perceived as shortest at about 9.3 seconds, which was 7.6% shorter than the actual duration of the stimulus. We also found that different interval patterns of sounds in auditory information significantly affected users' perception of time passing as shorter, while different numbers of sounds did not.","Voice Assistants can manipulate users' perception of time, making them perceive time as shorter or longer depending on the auditory stimuli used. This can lead to users being unaware of how much time has passed, potentially leading to wasted time or decreased productivity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376157,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Pronto: Rapid Augmented Reality Video Prototyping Using Sketches and Enaction,"Designers have limited tools to prototype AR experiences rapidly. Can lightweight, immediate tools let designers prototype dynamic AR interactions while capturing the nuances of a 3D experience? We interviewed three AR experts and identified several recurring issues in AR design: creating and positioning 3D assets, handling the changing user position, and orchestrating multiple animations. We introduce PROJECT PRONTO, a tablet-based video prototyping system that combines 2D video with 3D manipulation. PRONTO supports four intertwined activities: capturing 3D spatial information alongside a video scenario, positioning and sketching 2D drawings in a 3D world, and enacting animations with physical interactions. An observational study with professional designers shows that participants can use PRONTO to prototype diverse AR experiences. All participants performed two tasks: replicating a sample non-trivial AR experience and prototyping their open-ended designs. All participants completed the replication task and found PRONTO easy to use. Most participants found that PRONTO encourages more exploration of designs than their current practices.","

The article highlights the challenges of designing dynamic AR interactions and the limitations of current tools. The introduction of a new tool, PROJECT PRONTO, aims to address these issues but may also lead to an over-reliance on technology and a decrease in human interaction and creativity. As designers become more dependent on technology, they may lose the ability to think outside the box and create unique, innovative solutions. Additionally, the use of tablet-based video prototyping may lead to a decrease in physical activity and an increase in screen time, which can have negative effects on physical and mental health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376160,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Self-Expression by Design: Co-Designing the ExpressiBall with Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,"Expressing one's thoughts and feelings is a fundamental human need - the basis for communication and social interaction. We ask, how do minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum express themselves? How can we better recognise instances of self-expression? And how might technologies support and encourage self-expression? To address these questions, we undertook co-design research at an autism-specific primary school with 20 children over one school year. This paper contributes six Modalities of Self-Expression, through which children self-express and convey their design insights. Each modality of self-expression can occur across two different dimensions (socio-expressive and auto-expressive) and can be of a fundamental or an integrative nature. Further, we contribute the design trajectory of a tangible ball prototype, the ExpressiBall, which - through voice, sounds, lights, and motion sensors - explores how tangible technologies can support this range of expressive modalities. Finally, we discuss the concept of Self-Expression by Design.","

Is This An Ad?: Automatically Disclosing Online Endorsements On YouTube With AdIntuition,"Undisclosed online endorsements on social media can be misleading to users who may not know when viewed content contains advertisements. Despite federal regulations requiring content creators to disclose online endorsements, studies suggest that less than 10% do so in practice. To overcome this issue, we need knowledge of how to best detect online endorsements, knowledge about how prevalent online endorsements are in the wild, and ways to design systems to automatically disclose advertising content to viewers. To that end, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a tool called AdIntuition which automatically discloses when YouTube videos contain affiliate marketing, a type of social media endorsement. We evaluated AdIntuition with 783 users using a survey, field deployment, and diary study. We discuss our findings and recommendations for future measurements of and tools to detect and alert users about affiliate marketing content.",Misleading online endorsements on social media.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376178,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Unplatformed Design: A Model for Appropriating Social Media Technologies for Coordinated Participation,"Using existing social media technologies as a resource for design offers significant potential for sustainable and scalable ways of coordinating participation. We look at three exemplar projects in three distinct domains that have successfully coordinated participation through the configuration and augmentation of existing social media technologies: participatory future forecasting, participatory health research, and connectivist learning. In this paper we conceptualise social media technologies as material for design, that is, as the raw material with which coordinated participation is realized. From this we develop a model that proposes four material qualities of social media technologies, morphology, role, representation of activity and permeability, and point to how they can be productively employed in the design of coordination of participation.","
The article highlights the potential for social media technologies to be used in ways that reinforce existing power dynamics, particularly in the context of participatory health research. The use of social media technologies can perpetuate existing inequalities, particularly if they are not designed with careful consideration of their material qualities. For example, if social media technologies are not designed to be accessible to diverse populations, they may only serve to further marginalize already underrepresented groups. Additionally, the use of social media technologies can also perpetuate existing power dynamics by reinforcing dominant narratives and silencing marginalized voices. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the material qualities of social media technologies and design them in ways that promote equity and inclusion.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376179,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"""On Finsta, I can say 'Hail Satan'"": Being Authentic but Disagreeable on Instagram","We use personality theory to compare self-presentation between multiple Instagram accounts, investigating authenticity and consistency. Many studies claim social media promote inauthentic self-presentation focused on socially desirable traits. At the same time, affordances suggest that self-presentation should be relatively consistent within one social medium. For 88 participants, we examine personality traits for 'real Instagram' ('Rinsta') versus 'fake Instagram' ('Finsta') accounts, comparing these with people's offline traits using mixed-methods. Counterintuitively, we find Finsta accounts often present socially undesirable traits. Furthermore, different accounts on the same social medium reveal quite different styles of self-presentation. Overall Finstas are more Extraverted, less Conscientious, and less Agreeable than Rinstas, although equally Neurotic as offline. Interviews indicate trait differences arise from differing audience perceptions. A large anonymous Rinsta audience promotes a carefully curated self. In contrast, a small but trusted Finsta audience can engender more authentic, but negative self-presentation. We discuss design and theory implications.","Social media platforms like Instagram can encourage people to present a fake, curated version of themselves to a large audience, rather than their authentic self.

Experiential Qualities of Whispering with Voice Assistants,"We present a Research through Design project that explores how whispering influences the ways people experience and interact with voice assistants. The research project includes a co-speculation workshop and the use of a design probe, which culminated in the production of a design fiction short film. Our design-led inquiry contributes with experiential qualities of whispering with voice assistants: creepiness, trust, and intimacy. Furthermore, we present how whispering opens up new dimensions of how and when voice interaction could be used. We propose that designers of whispering voice assistants should reflect on how they facilitate the experiential qualities of creepiness, trust, and intimacy, and reflect on the potential challenges whispering brings to the relation between a user and a voice assistant.","Creepiness.

Dynamics of Aimed Mid-air Movements,"Mid-air arm movements are ubiquitous in VR, AR, and gestural interfaces. While mouse movements have received some attention, the dynamics of mid-air movements are understudied in HCI. In this paper we present an exploratory analysis of the dynamics of aimed mid-air movements. We explore the 3rd order lag (3OL) and existing 2nd order lag (2OL) models for modeling these dynamics. For a majority of movements the 3OL model captures mid-air dynamics better, in particular acceleration. The models can effectively predict the complete time series of position, velocity and acceleration of aimed movements given an initial state and a target using three (2OL) or four (3OL) free parameters.","

Therminator: Understanding the Interdependency of Visual and On-Body Thermal Feedback in Virtual Reality,"Recent advances have made Virtual Reality (VR) more realistic than ever before. This improved realism is attributed to today's ability to increasingly appeal to human sensations, such as visual, auditory or tactile. While research also examines temperature sensation as an important aspect, the interdependency of visual and thermal perception in VR is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose Therminator, a thermal display concept that provides warm and cold on-body feedback in VR through heat conduction of flowing liquids with different temperatures. Further, we systematically evaluate the interdependency of different visual and thermal stimuli on the temperature perception of arm and abdomen with 25 participants. As part of the results, we found varying temperature perception depending on the stimuli, as well as increasing involvement of users during conditions with matching stimuli.","

The increased realism in Virtual Reality technology can lead to a decrease in the user's awareness of their surroundings, causing them to become disconnected from reality. This can result in a decrease in physical activity, social isolation, and a lack of engagement with the real world. Additionally, the use of thermal displays, such as the Therminator, can cause users to become desensitized to temperature changes in the real world, leading to potential health risks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376195,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"The Effects of Explicit Intention Communication, Conspicuous Sensors, and Pedestrian Attitude in Interactions with Automated Vehicles","In this paper, we investigate the effect of an external human-machine interface (eHMI) and a conspicuous external vehicle appearance due to visible sensors on pedestrian interactions with automated vehicles (AVs). Recent research shows that AVs may need to explicitly communicate with the environment due to the absence of a driver. Furthermore, in interaction situations, an AV that looks different and conspicuous owing to an extensive sensor system may potentially lead to hesitation stemming from mistrust in automation. Thus, we evaluated in a virtual reality study how pedestrian attitude, the presence/absence of an eHMI, and a conspicuous sensor system affect their willingness to cross the road. Results recommend the use of an eHMI. A conspicuous appearance of automated-driving capability had no effect for the sample as a whole, although it led to more efficient crossing decisions for those with a more negative attitude towards AVs. Our findings contribute towards the effective design of future AV interfaces.","

High Tempo Work: Design Challenges for Head-worn Displays in Quick Service Restaurants,"Quick service restaurants (QSRs) are high tempo work environments that require collaboration and communication between crew. In a number of respects, head-worn displays (HWDs) might seem a promising technology to support QSR crew, but on close inspection they raise challenging issues for design. We conducted fieldwork studies at two large QSRs to understand how work is organised, how existing systems are used, and how information is displayed to and communicated between crew. We observed the crew working both routinely and with improvisation, collaboratively and individually, physically and digitally. From our analysis of the field study, we identify tentative use cases for HWDs, but with these also design tensions-that is, opportunities coupled with challenges that appear difficult to circumvent even with modest design proposals. These tensions would require careful consideration if HWDs were to be deployed in in QSRs, given that HWDs are ubiquitous, potentially private, digital, mobile, and able to collect behavioural data.","Head-worn displays (HWDs) in quick service restaurants (QSRs) could create design tensions, such as privacy concerns and potential for misuse of collected data, that may outweigh the benefits of using the technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376200,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
User's Role in Platform Infrastructuralization: WeChat as an Exemplar,"Recent years have witnessed the rise of platforms such as Facebook and Google. Gigantic in scope and becoming omnipresent, these platforms are acquiring qualities of infrastructure, which is large-scale connected systems that support people's activities invisibly. Recent scholarship has identified WeChat, the most popular mobile social platform in China, as infrastructure. WeChat follows a platform logic to expand, and by conforming to the Chinese government's techno-nationalist focus, it has gradually become an infrastructure in China. We contribute to the understanding of platform infrastructuralization by taking WeChat as a case, highlighting the user's role in this process. We find user contributes to WeChat's infrastructuralization through a three-level interaction process: to practice, to appropriate, and to create. By calling out the user's role in platform infra-structuralization, we discuss how the CHI community can contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon.","Users are contributing to the infrastructuralization of Social Media platforms, such as WeChat, without realizing it, which can lead to a loss of control over their personal data and privacy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376201,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Developing a Personality Model for Speech-based Conversational Agents Using the Psycholexical Approach,"We present the first systematic analysis of personality dimensions developed specifically to describe the personality of speech-based conversational agents. Following the psycholexical approach from psychology, we first report on a new multi-method approach to collect potentially descriptive adjectives from 1) a free description task in an online survey (228 unique descriptors), 2) an interaction task in the lab (176 unique descriptors), and 3) a text analysis of 30,000 online reviews of conversational agents (Alexa, Google Assistant, Cortana) (383 unique descriptors). We aggregate the results into a set of 349 adjectives, which are then rated by 744 people in an online survey. A factor analysis reveals that the commonly used Big Five model for human personality does not adequately describe agent personality. As an initial step to developing a personality model, we propose alternative dimensions and discuss implications for the design of agent personalities, personality-aware personalisation, and future research.","

The development of personality dimensions for speech-based conversational agents could lead to the creation of agents that are perceived as having personalities that are not aligned with human values and ethics. This could result in agents that are perceived as being manipulative, dishonest, or untrustworthy, which could have negative consequences for their use in various applications.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376210,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
Effects of Credibility Indicators on Social Media News Sharing Intent,"In recent years, social media services have been leveraged to spread fake news stories.

We confirmed that credibility indicators can indeed decrease the propensity to share fake news. However, the impact of the indicators varied, with fact checking services being the most effective.

A Palette of Deepened Emotions: Exploring Emotional Challenge in Virtual Reality Games,"Recent work introduced the notion of 'emotional challenge' promising for understanding more unique and diverse player experiences (PX). Although emotional challenge has immediately attracted HCI researchers' attention, the concept has not been experimentally explored, especially in virtual reality (VR), one of the latest gaming environments. We conducted two experiments to investigate how emotional challenge affects PX when separately from or jointly with conventional challenge in VR and PC conditions. We found that relatively exclusive emotional challenge induced a wider range of different emotions in both conditions, while the adding of emotional challenge broadened emotional responses only in VR. In both experiments, VR significantly enhanced the measured PX of emotional responses, appreciation, immersion and presence. Our findings indicate that VR may be an ideal medium to present emotional challenge and also extend the understanding of emotional (and conventional) challenge in video games.","Emotional challenges in VR can lead to a wider range of negative emotions, such as anxiety, fear, and sadness, which can negatively impact players' mental health and well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376221,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"""All in the Same Boat"": Tradeoffs of Voice Assistant Ownership for Mixed-Visual-Ability Families","A growing body of evidence suggests Voice Assistants (VAs) are highly valued by people with vision impairments (PWVI) and much less so by sighted users. Yet, many are deployed in homes where both PWVI and sighted family members reside. Researchers have yet to study whether VA use and perceived benefits are affected in settings where one person has a visual impairment and others do not. We conducted six in-depth interviews with partners to understand patterns of domestic VA use in mixed-visual-ability families. Although PWVI were more motivated to acquire VAs, used them more frequently, and learned more proactively about their features, partners with vision identified similar benefits and disadvantages of having VAs in their home. We found that the universal usability of VAs both equalizes experience across abilities and presents complex tradeoffs for families-regarding interpersonal relationships, domestic labor, and physical safety-which are weighed against accessibility benefits for PWVI and complicate the decision to fully integrate VAs in the home.","

Bridging the Virtual and Real Worlds: A Preliminary Study of Messaging Notifications in Virtual Reality,"Virtual reality (VR) platforms provide their users with immersive virtual environments, but disconnect them from real-world events. The increasing length of VR sessions can therefore be expected to boost users' needs to obtain information about external occurrences such as message arrival. Yet, how and when to present these real-world notifications to users engaged in VR activities remains underexplored. We conducted an experiment to investigate individuals' receptivity during four VR activities (Loading, 360 Video, Treasure Hunt, Rhythm Game) to message notifications delivered using three types of displays (head-mounted, controller, and movable panel). While higher engagement generally led to higher perceptions that notifications were ill-timed and/or disruptive, the suitability of notification displays to VR activities was influenced by the time-sensitiveness of VR content, overlapping use of modalities for delivering alerts, the display locations, and a requirement that the display be moved for notifications to be seen. Specific design suggestions are also provided.",Users may be disconnected from real-world events and may have difficulty receiving timely notifications during VR sessions.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376228,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Will the Crowd Game the Algorithm?: Using Layperson Judgments to Combat Misinformation on Social Media by Downranking Distrusted Sources,"How can social media platforms fight the spread of misinformation? One possibility is to use newsfeed algorithms to downrank content from sources that users rate as untrustworthy. But will laypeople be handicapped by motivated reasoning or lack of expertise, and thus unable to identify misinformation sites? And will they ""game"" this crowdsourcing mechanism in order to promote content that aligns with their partisan agendas? We conducted a survey experiment in which =984 Americans indicated their trust in numerous news sites. To study the tendency of people to game the system, half of the participants were told their responses would inform social media ranking algorithms. Participants trusted mainstream sources much more than hyper-partisan or fake news sources, and their ratings were highly correlated with professional fact-checker judgments. Critically, informing participants that their responses would influence ranking algorithms did not diminish these results, despite the manipulation increasing the political polarization of trust ratings.","Social media platforms' use of algorithms to downrank untrustworthy sources can be manipulated by users with partisan agendas, leading to the spread of misinformation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376232,Social Media,CHI,politics

JumpVR: Jump-Based Locomotion Augmentation for Virtual Reality,"One of the great benefits of virtual reality (VR) is the implementation of features that go beyond realism. Common ""unrealistic"" locomotion techniques (like teleportation) can avoid spatial limitation of tracking, but minimize potential benefits of more realistic techniques (e.g. walking). As an alternative that combines realistic physical movement with hyper-realistic virtual outcome, we present JumpVR, a jump-based locomotion augmentation technique that virtually scales users' physical jumps. In a user study (N=28), we show that jumping in VR (regardless of scaling) can significantly increase presence, motivation and immersion compared to teleportation, while largely not increasing simulator sickness. Further, participants reported higher immersion and motivation for most scaled jumping variants than forward-jumping. Our work shows the feasibility and benefits of jumping in VR and explores suitable parameters for its hyper-realistic scaling. We discuss design implications for VR experiences and research.","

The use of virtual reality technology can lead to a decrease in physical activity, as users may rely on virtual means of movement, such as teleportation, instead of physically moving around.

Informed by four participatory design sessions with teachers and children, we developed five ARMath modules to support basic arithmetic and 2D geometry. We also conducted an exploratory evaluation of ARMath with 27 children (ages 5-8) at a local children's museum. Our findings demonstrate how ARMath engages children in math learning, how failures in AI can be used as learning opportunities, and challenges that children face when using ARMath.","

The use of Augmented Reality technology in education, as demonstrated by ARMath, may lead to a reliance on technology and a decrease in critical thinking skills. Children may become too dependent on the technology to solve problems, rather than using their own cognitive abilities. Additionally, the use of AI-powered manipulatives may lead to a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts, as children may not fully comprehend the processes being performed by the AI. This could result in a surface-level understanding of math, rather than a deep understanding of the subject.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376252,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Race Yourselves: A Longitudinal Exploration of Self-Competition Between Past, Present, and Future Performances in a VR Exergame","Participating in competitive races can be a thrilling experience for athletes, involving a rush of excitement and sensations of flow, achievement, and self-fulfilment. However, for non-athletes, the prospect of competition is often a scary one which affects intrinsic motivation negatively, especially for less fit, less competitive individuals. We propose a novel method making the positive racing experience accessible to non-athletes using a high-intensity cycling VR exergame: by recording and replaying all their previous gameplay sessions simultaneously, including a projected future performance, players can race against a crowd of ""ghost"" avatars representing their individual fitness journey. The experience stays relevant and exciting as every race adds a new competitor. A longitudinal study over four weeks and a cross-sectional study found that the new method improves physical performance, intrinsic motivation, and flow compared to a non-competitive exergame. Additionally, the longitudinal study provides insights into the longer-term effects of VR exergames.","

Examining Design Choices of Questionnaires in VR User Studies,"Questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (VR) user studies. Transitioning from virtuality to reality for giving self-reports on VR experiences can lead to systematic biases. VR allows to embed questionnaires into the virtual environment which may ease participation and avoid biases. To provide a cohesive picture of methods and design choices for questionnaires in VR (inVRQ), we discuss 15 inVRQ studies from the literature and present a survey with 67 VR experts from academia and industry. Based on the outcomes, we conducted two user studies in which we tested different presentation and interaction methods of inVRQs and evaluated the usability and practicality of our design. We observed comparable completion times between inVRQs and questionnaires outside VR (nonVRQs) with higher enjoyment but lower usability for \inVRQs. These findings advocate the application of inVRQs and provide an overview of methods and considerations that lay the groundwork for inVRQ design.","

Informing the Design of Privacy-Empowering Tools for the Connected Home,"Connected devices in the home represent a potentially grave new privacy threat due to their unfettered access to the most personal spaces in people's lives. Prior work has shown that despite concerns about such devices, people often lack sufficient awareness, understanding, or means of taking effective action. To explore the potential for new tools that support such needs directly we developed Aretha, a privacy assistant technology probe that combines a network disaggregator, personal tutor, and firewall, to empower end-users with both the knowledge and mechanisms to control disclosures from their homes. We deployed Aretha in three households over six weeks, with the aim of understanding how this combination of capabilities might enable users to gain awareness of data disclosures by their devices, form educated privacy preferences, and to block unwanted data flows. The probe, with its novel affordances-and its limitations-prompted users to co-adapt, finding new control mechanisms and suggesting new approaches to address the challenge of regaining privacy in the connected home.","

Virtual Reality Games for People Using Wheelchairs,"Virtual Reality (VR) holds the promise of providing engaging embodied experiences, but little is known about how people with disabilities engage with it. We explore challenges and opportunities of VR gaming for wheelchair users. First, we present findings from a survey that received 25 responses and gives insights into wheelchair users' motives to (non-) engage with VR and their experiences. Drawing from this survey, we derive design implications which we tested through implementation and qualitative evaluation of three full-body VR game prototypes with 18 participants. Our results show that VR gaming engages wheelchair users, though nuanced consideration is required for the design of embodied immersive experiences for minority bodies, and we illustrate how designers can create meaningful, positive experiences.","

BodyLights: Open-Ended Augmented Feedback to Support Training Towards a Correct Exercise Execution,"Technologies targeting a correct execution of physical training exercises typically use pre-determined models for what they consider correct, automatizing instruction and feedback. This falls short on catering to diverse trainees and exercises. We explore an alternative design approach, in which technology provides open-ended feedback for trainers and trainees to use during training. With a personal trainer we designed the augmentation of 18 strength training exercises with BodyLights: 3D printed wearable projecting lights that augment body movement and orientation. To study them, 15 trainees at different skill levels trained three times with our personal trainer and BodyLights. Our findings show that BodyLights catered to a wide range of trainees and exercises, and supported understanding, executing and correcting diverse technique parameters. We discuss design features and methodological aspects that allowed this; and what open-ended feedback offered in comparison to current technology approaches to support training towards a correct exercise execution.","Augmented/Virtual Reality technology may not cater to diverse trainees and exercises, relying on pre-determined models that may not accommodate individual differences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376268,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Please Call the Specialism: Using WeChat to Support Patient Care in China,"We examine how WeChat has been adopted to support nurse-patient communication in an IVF clinic in China. In this setting, the biggest challenge to delivering high-quality patient-centred care is the large number of patients. Nurses typically spend less than five minutes with each patient during clinical visits. To compensate for such minimal in-person consultation, nurse-facilitated patient groups were created on WeChat, to extend medical care and facilitate peer support. Through an ethnographic study, we examined how these groups fit into the clinic's communication ecosystem, and the challenges they raise for nurse-facilitators who receive thousands of messages daily. We propose a set of design suggestions aiming to make the work of the nurse-facilitator easier and more effective. In highlighting the opportunities and challenges of using chat to extend care beyond the clinic, we contribute to a burgeoning discussion of how chat can support patient care in the Global South.","

Collective Support and Independent Learning with a Voice-Based Literacy Technology in Rural Communities,"Access to literacy is critical to children's futures, but formal education may be insufficient for fostering early literacy, especially in low-resource contexts. Educational technologies used at home may be able to help, but it is unclear whether or how children (and families) will use such technologies at home in rural communities, particularly in low-literate families. In this paper, we investigate these questions with a voice-based literacy technology deployed with families in 8 rural communities in Côte d'Ivoire for 4 months. We use interviews and observations with 37 families to investigate motivations, methods, and barriers for rural families' engagement with a literacy technology accessible via feature phones. We contribute insights into how families view digital literacy as a learning goal, leverage networks of supporters, and over time, transition from explicit to implicit support for children's learning.","
Voice Assistant technology may not be effective in promoting literacy in low-resource communities, especially in rural areas where access to education and technology is limited. The technology may not be user-friendly or accessible to families who are not familiar with digital literacy, and it may not provide adequate support for children's learning. Additionally, the reliance on technology may lead to a lack of human interaction and social support, which is important for children's cognitive and emotional development.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376276,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
MoveVR: Enabling Multiform Force Feedback in Virtual Reality using Household Cleaning Robot,"Haptic feedback can significantly enhance the realism and immersiveness of virtual reality (VR) systems. In this paper, we propose MoveVR, a technique that enables realistic, multiform force feedback in VR leveraging commonplace cleaning robots. MoveVR can generate tension, resistance, impact and material rigidity force feedback with multiple levels of force intensity and directions. This is achieved by changing the robot's moving speed, rotation, position as well as the carried proxies. We demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of MoveVR through interactive VR gaming. In our quantitative and qualitative evaluation studies, participants found that MoveVR provides more realistic and enjoyable user experience when compared to commercially available haptic solutions such as vibrotactile haptic systems.","

The use of commonplace cleaning robots to generate haptic feedback in virtual reality systems could lead to a decrease in the number of jobs available for humans, as robots become more advanced and capable of performing tasks that were previously done by humans. This could lead to increased inequality and unemployment, as well as a loss of skills and knowledge among the human workforce. Additionally, the use of robots to provide haptic feedback could also lead to a decrease in the amount of physical activity that humans engage in, as they become more reliant on technology to provide sensory experiences, potentially leading to negative health consequences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376286,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,economy
Mixed Reality Light Fields for Interactive Remote Assistance,"Remote assistance represents an important use case for mixed reality. With the rise of handheld and wearable devices, remote assistance has become practical in the wild. However, spontaneous provisioning of remote assistance requires an easy, fast and robust approach for capturing and sharing of unprepared environments. In this work, we make a case for utilizing interactive light fields for remote assistance. We demonstrate the advantages of object representation using light fields over conventional geometric reconstruction. Moreover, we introduce an interaction method for quickly annotating light fields in 3D space without requiring surface geometry to anchor annotations. We present results from a user study demonstrating the effectiveness of our interaction techniques, and we provide feedback on the usability of our overall system.","

The use of interactive light fields for remote assistance in Augmented/Virtual Reality technology may lead to a decrease in the ability to accurately perceive and interact with the physical environment, as users may become overly reliant on virtual representations. This could result in a decrease in spatial awareness and an increase in accidents or errors. Additionally, the use of light fields for object representation may also lead to privacy concerns, as it allows for the capture and sharing of detailed information about the environment without the knowledge or consent of those present.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376289,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Collaborative Technologies for Children with Special Needs: A Systematic Literature Review,"This paper presents a systematic literature review on collaborative technologies for children with special needs in ACM Digital Library. The aim of the review is to (1) reveal the current state of the art, (2) identify the types of technologies and contexts of use, the demographics and special needs of the target group, and the methodological approaches and theoretical groundings, and (3) define a future research agenda. The results of the systematic literature review show that collaborative technologies for children with special needs are increasingly gaining attention, mostly involve tangible and/or embodied interaction, and are often developed for use in the classroom. The target group that is most represented are boys between 6 to 12 years with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The results further show a wide range of evaluation criteria for measuring collaboration, an interchanging use of theoretical concepts and a lack of definitions for the concept collaboration, and a need for more demographically diverse studies.","

The increasing use of collaborative technologies for children with special needs, particularly those with Autism Spectrum Disorder, may lead to a lack of social interaction and communication skills in real-life situations. The reliance on technology may hinder the development of essential life skills, such as empathy, problem-solving, and conflict resolution. Additionally, the narrow focus on tangible and embodied interaction may neglect the importance of developing cognitive and emotional abilities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376291,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Miniature Haptics: Experiencing Haptic Feedback through Hand-based and Embodied Avatars,"We present Miniature Haptics, a new approach to providing realistic haptic experiences by applying miniaturized haptic feedback to hand-based, embodied avatars. By shrinking haptics to a much smaller scale, Miniature Haptics enables the exploration of new haptic experiences that are not practical to create at the full, human-body scale. Using Finger Walking in Place (FWIP) as an example avatar embodiment and control method, we first explored the feasibility of Miniature Haptics then conducted a human factors study to understand how people map their full-body skeletal model to their hands. To understand the user experience of Miniature Haptic, we developed a miniature football haptic display, and results from our user study show that Miniature Haptics significantly improved the realism and enjoyment of the experience and is preferred by users (p < 0.05). In addition, we present two miniature motion platforms supporting the haptic experiences of: 1) rapidly changing ground height for platform jumping games such as Super Mario Bros and 2) changing terrain slope. Overall, Miniature Haptics makes it possible to explore novel haptic experiences that have not been practical before.","

The miniaturization of haptic feedback in virtual reality could lead to a decrease in the sense of immersion and realism for users, potentially reducing the overall effectiveness of the technology. Additionally, the use of miniature avatars may not accurately represent the full-body experience, leading to a disconnect between the user's physical movements and the virtual environment. This could result in a less enjoyable and less realistic experience for the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376292,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Digital Juries: A Civics-Oriented Approach to Platform Governance,"As concerns have grown regarding harmful content spread on social media, platform mechanisms for content moderation have become increasingly significant. However, many existing platform governance structures lack formal processes for democratic participation by users of the platform. Drawing inspiration from constitutional jury trials in many legal systems, this paper proposes digital juries as a civics-oriented approach for adjudicating content moderation cases. Building on existing theoretical models of jury decision-making, we outline a 5-stage model characterizing the space of design considerations in a digital jury process. We implement two examples of jury designs involving blind-voting and deliberation. From users who participate in our jury implementations, we gather informed judgments of the democratic legitimacy of a jury process for content moderation. We find that digital juries are perceived as more procedurally just than existing common platform moderation practices, but also find disagreement over whether jury decisions should be enforced or used as recommendations.","Lack of democratic participation in content moderation.

Knock on Wood: Combining Redirected Touching and Physical Props for Tool-Based Interaction in Virtual Reality,"When physical props serve as proxies for virtual tools used to manipulate the virtual environment, it is challenging to provide appropriate haptic feedback. Redirected tool-mediated manipulation addresses this challenge by distorting the mapping between physical and virtual tools to provide a sensation of manipulating the virtual environment, when the physical tool comes into contact with another physical prop. For example, a virtual hammer's position can be offset to ensure that physical impacts accompany each strike of a virtual nail. We demonstrate the idea by showing that it can be used to create sensations of impact and resistance when driving a virtual nail into a surface, when tightening a virtual screw, and when sawing through a virtual plank. The results of a user study indicate that the proposed approach is perceived as more realistic than interaction with a single physical prop or controller and no notable detriments to precision were observed.","Redirected tool-mediated manipulation can make users feel like they're physically interacting with virtual objects, potentially leading to a blurring of reality and fantasy. This could result in users becoming less aware of their physical surroundings and neglecting real-world responsibilities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376303,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
An Honest Conversation: Transparently Combining Machine and Human Speech Assistance in Public Spaces,"There is widespread concern over the ways speech assistant providers currently use humans to listen to users' queries without their knowledge. We report two iterations of the TalkBack smart speaker, which transparently combines machine and human assistance. In the first, we created a prototype to investigate whether people would choose to forward their questions to a human answerer if the machine was unable to help. Longitudinal deployment revealed that most users would do so when given the explicit choice. In the second iteration we extended the prototype to draw upon spoken answers from previous deployments, combining machine efficiency with human richness. Deployment of this second iteration shows that this corpus can help provide relevant, human-created instant responses. We distil lessons learned for those developing conversational agents or other AI-infused systems about how to appropriately enlist human-in-the-loop information services to benefit users, task workers and system performance.","

Social Boundaries for Personal Agents in the Interpersonal Space of the Home,"The presence of voice activated personal assistants (VAPAs) in people's homes rises each year [31]. Industry efforts are invested in making interactions with VAPAs more personal by leveraging information from messages and calendars, and by accessing user accounts for 3rd party services. However, the use of personal data becomes more complicated in interpersonal spaces, such as people's homes. Should a shared agent access the information of many users? If it does, how should it navigate issues of privacy and control? Designers currently lack guidelines to help them design appropriate agent behaviors. We used Speed Dating to explore inchoate social mores around agent actions within a home, including issues of proactivity, interpersonal conflict, and agent prevarication. Findings offer new insights on how more socially sophisticated agents might sense, make judgements about, and navigate social roles and individuals. We discuss how our findings might impact future research and future agent behaviors.","

Gripmarks: Using Hand Grips to Transform In-Hand Objects into Mixed Reality Input,"We introduce Gripmarks, a system that enables users to opportunistically use objects they are already holding as input surfaces for mixed reality head-mounted displays (HMD). Leveraging handheld objects reduces the need for users to free up their hands or acquire a controller to interact with their HMD. Gripmarks associate a particular hand grip with the shape primitive of the physical object without the need of object recognition or instrumenting the object. From the grip pose and shape primitive we can infer the surface of the object. With an activation gesture, we can enable the object for use as input to the HMD. With five gripmarks we demonstrate a recognition rate of 94.2%; we show that our grip detection benefits from the physical constraints of holding an object. We explore two categories of input objects 1) tangible surfaces and 2) tangible tools and present two representative applications. We discuss the design and technical challenges for expanding the concept.","

The use of objects as input surfaces for mixed reality head-mounted displays (HMD) could lead to a decrease in hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills as users rely more on objects they are holding to interact with the virtual world, rather than using their hands and fingers to manipulate virtual objects directly. This could have negative impacts on activities that require manual dexterity and coordination in the physical world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376313,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Studying the Effects of Cognitive Biases in Evaluation of Conversational Agents,"Humans quite frequently interact with conversational agents. The rapid advancement in generative language modeling through neural networks has helped advance the creation of intelligent conversational agents. Researchers typically evaluate the output of their models through crowdsourced judgments, but there are no established best practices for conducting such studies. Moreover, it is unclear if cognitive biases in decision-making are affecting crowdsourced workers' judgments when they undertake these tasks. To investigate, we conducted a between-subjects study with 77 crowdsourced workers to understand the role of cognitive biases, specifically anchoring bias, when humans are asked to evaluate the output of conversational agents. Our results provide insight into how best to evaluate conversational agents. We find increased consistency in ratings across two experimental conditions may be a result of anchoring bias. We also determine that external factors such as time and prior experience in similar tasks have effects on inter-rater consistency.","
Crowdsourced workers' judgments of conversational agents' output may be affected by cognitive biases, such as anchoring bias, which can lead to inconsistent and potentially inaccurate evaluations.

"""Hi! I am the Crowd Tasker"" Crowdsourcing through Digital Voice Assistants","Inspired by the increasing prevalence of digital voice assistants, we demonstrate the feasibility of using voice interfaces to deploy and complete crowd tasks. We have developed Crowd Tasker, a novel system that delivers crowd tasks through a digital voice assistant. In a lab study, we validate our proof-of-concept and show that crowd task performance through a voice assistant is comparable to that of a web interface for voice-compatible and voice-based crowd tasks for native English speakers. We also report on a field study where participants used our system in their homes. We find that crowdsourcing through voice can provide greater flexibility to crowd workers by allowing them to work in brief sessions, enabling multi-tasking, and reducing the time and effort required to initiate tasks. We conclude by proposing a set of design guidelines for the creation of crowd tasks for voice and the development of future voice-based crowdsourcing systems.","

The increasing prevalence of digital voice assistants may lead to a decrease in the quality of work produced by crowd workers, as they may be more focused on completing tasks quickly and efficiently through voice commands rather than thoroughly and accurately. Additionally, the reliance on voice commands may also lead to a lack of flexibility in the workforce, as workers may be limited to completing tasks that can be easily communicated through voice commands.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376320,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
WithYou: Automated Adaptive Speech Tutoring With Context-Dependent Speech Recognition,"Learning to speak in foreign languages is hard. Speech shadowing has been rising as a proven way to practice speaking, which asks a learner to listen and repeat a native speech template as simultaneously as possible. However, shadowing can be hard to do because learners can frequently fail to follow the speech and unintentionally interrupt a practice session. Worse, as a technical way to evaluate shadowing performance in real-time has not been established, no automated solutions are available to help. In this paper, we propose a technical framework with context-dependent speech recognition to evaluate shadowing in real-time. We propose a shadowing tutor system called WithYou, which can automatically adjust the playback and the difficulty of a speech template when learners fail, so shadowing becomes smooth and tailored. Results from a user study show that WithYou provides greater speech improvements (14%) than the conventional method (2.7%) with a lower cognitive load.","
The over-reliance on voice assistants can lead to a decrease in the ability to speak in foreign languages, as people may rely solely on technology to communicate instead of practicing their speaking skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376322,Voice Assistant,CHI,access to information & discourse
MRAT: The Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit,"Significant tool support exists for the development of mixed reality (MR) applications; however, there is a lack of tools for analyzing MR experiences. We elicit requirements for future tools through interviews with 8 university research, instructional, and media teams using AR/VR in a variety of domains. While we find a common need for capturing how users perform tasks in MR, the primary differences were in terms of heuristics and metrics relevant to each project. Particularly in the early project stages, teams were uncertain about what data should, and even could, be collected with MR technologies. We designed the Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit (MRAT) to instrument MR apps via visual editors without programming and enable rapid data collection and filtering for visualizations of MR user sessions. With MRAT, we contribute flexible interaction tracking and task definition concepts, an extensible set of heuristic techniques and metrics to measure task success, and visual inspection tools with in-situ visualizations in MR. Focusing on a multi-user, cross-device MR crisis simulation and triage training app as a case study, we then show the benefits of using MRAT, not only for user testing of MR apps, but also performance tuning throughout the design process.","

The development of MR technology may lead to a lack of tools for analyzing MR experiences, making it difficult for researchers and developers to understand how users interact with MR applications and identify areas for improvement. This could result in the creation of MR applications that are not user-friendly or effective, leading to a negative user experience and a lack of adoption.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376330,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Investigating the Effects of Self-Avatars and Story-Relevant Avatars on Children's Creative Storytelling,"Storytelling is a critical step in the cognitive development of children. Particularly, this requires children to mentally project into the story context and to identify with the thoughts of the characters in their stories. We propose to support free imagination in creative storytelling through an enactment-based approach that allows children to embody an avatar and perform as the story character. We designed our story creation interface with two modes of avatar: the story-relevant avatar and the self-avatar, to investigate the effects of avatar design on the quality of children's creative products. In our study with 20 child participants, the results indicate that self-avatars can create a stronger sense of identification and embodied presence, while story-relevant avatars can provide a scaffold for mental projection.",Children's over-identification with virtual avatars may hinder their ability to develop their own identity and self-awareness.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376331,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Vibrotactile Funneling Illusion and Localization Performance on the Head,"The vibrotactile funneling illusion is the sensation of a single (non-existing) stimulus somewhere in-between the actual stimulus locations. Its occurrence depends upon body location, distance between the actuators, signal synchronization, and intensity. Related work has shown that the funneling illusion may occur on the forehead. We were able to reproduce these findings and explored five further regions to get a more complete picture of the occurrence of the funneling illusion on the head. The results of our study (24 participants) show that the actuator distance, for which the funneling illusion occurs, strongly depends upon the head region. Moreover, we evaluated the centralizing bias (smaller perceived than actual actuator distances) for different head regions, which also showed widely varying characteristics. We computed a detailed heat map of vibrotactile localization accuracies on the head. The results inform the design of future tactile head-mounted displays that aim to support the funneling illusion.","

The vibrotactile funneling illusion can cause confusion and disorientation for users of tactile head-mounted displays, as they may perceive a single stimulus in a different location than the actual stimulus. This can lead to inaccuracies in localization and potentially cause users to become disoriented or lost in virtual environments.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376335,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"""Human, All Too Human"": NOAA Weather Radio and the Emotional Impact of Synthetic Voices","The integration of text-to-speech into an open technology stack for low-power FM community radio stations is an opportunity to automate laborious processes and increase accessibility to information in remote communities. However, there are open questions as to the perceived contrast of synthetic voices with the local and intimate format of community radio. This paper presents an exploratory focus group on the topic, followed by a thematic analysis of public comments on YouTube videos of the synthetic voices used for broadcasting by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio. We find that despite observed reservations about the suitability of TTS for radio, there is significant evidence of anthropomorphism, nostalgia and emotional connection in relation to these voices. Additionally, introduction of a more ""human sounding"" synthetic voice elicited significant negative feedback. We identify pronunciation, speed, suitability to content and acknowledgment of limitations as more relevant factors in listeners' stated sense of connection.","

The integration of text-to-speech technology in community radio stations may lead to a loss of personal connection and intimacy between the radio host and listeners, as synthetic voices may not be able to replicate the same level of emotional connection and warmth as human hosts.

Privacy and Activism in the Transgender Community,"Transgender people are marginalized, facing specific privacy concerns and high risk of online and offline harassment, discrimination, and violence. They also benefit tremendously from technology. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 transgender people from 3 U.S. cities about their computer security and privacy experiences broadly construed. Participants frequently returned to themes of activism and prosocial behavior, such as protest organization, political speech, and role-modeling transgender identities, so we focus our analysis on these themes. We identify several prominent risk models related to visibility, luck, and identity that participants used to analyze their own risk profiles, often as distinct or extreme. These risk perceptions may heavily influence transgender people's defensive behaviors and self-efficacy, jeopardizing their ability to defend themselves or gain technology's benefits. We articulate design lessons emerging from these ideas, contrasting and relating them to lessons about other marginalized groups whenever possible.","

Improving Humans' Ability to Interpret Deictic Gestures in Virtual Reality,"Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) offer unique opportunities for human communication. Humans can interact with each other over a distance in any environment and visual embodiment they want. Although deictic gestures are especially important as they can guide other humans' attention, humans make systematic errors when using and interpreting them. Recent work suggests that the interpretation of vertical deictic gestures can be significantly improved by warping the pointing arm. In this paper, we extend previous work by showing that models enable to also improve the interpretation of deictic gestures at targets all around the user. Through a study with 28 participants in a CVE, we analyzed the errors users make when interpreting deictic gestures. We derived a model that rotates the arm of a pointing user's avatar to improve the observing users' accuracy. A second study with 24 participants shows that we can improve observers' accuracy by 22.9%. As our approach is not noticeable for users, it improves their accuracy without requiring them to learn a new interaction technique or distracting from the experience.","

Parenting with Alexa: Exploring the Introduction of Smart Speakers on Family Dynamics,"Smart speakers have become pervasive in family homes, creating the potential for these devices to influence parent-child dynamics and parenting behaviors. We investigate the impact of introducing a smart speaker to 10 families with children, over four weeks. We use pre- and post- deployment interviews with the whole family and in-home audio capture of parent-child interactions with the smart speaker for our analysis. Despite the smart speaker causing occasional conflict in the home, we observed that parents lever-aged the smart speaker to further parenting goals. We found three forms of influence the smart speaker has on family dynamics: 1) fostering communication, 2) disrupting access, and 3) augmenting parenting. All of these influences arise from a communally accessible, stand-alone voice interface which democratizes family access to technology. We discuss design implications in furthering parenting practices and behaviors as the capabilities of the technology continue to improve.","

The Influence of Decaying the Representation of Older Social Media Content on Simulated Hiring Decisions,"Decaying representations gradually make social media content less visible to readers over time, which can help users disassociate from past online activities. We explore whether shrinking, one decaying representation, influences managers' assessments and simulated hiring decisions of job candidates, compared to seeing a full profile or an empty profile with no posts. Our 3 x 2 between-subjects crowdsourced survey (N = 360 US managers) shows that shrunk or empty profiles led to more positive decisions than profiles in their original full format. However, shrunk profiles also further contributed to more positive impressions of the candidates. Shrinking did not help the candidate of either gender more than the other and demographics of managers had limited impact on their assessment. Further, our managers regularly search job candidates' social media profiles in real life, suggesting that shrinking could support users' privacy. We finally present implications for individuals' privacy on social media.","Social media platforms' algorithms can make users' past content less visible over time, which can negatively impact their online reputation and future opportunities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376346,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Dear Pictograph: Investigating the Role of Personalization and Immersion for Consuming and Enjoying Visualizations,"Much of the visualization literature focuses on assessment of visual representations with regard to their effectiveness for understanding data. In the present work, we instead focus on making data visualization experiences more enjoyable, to foster deeper engagement with data. We investigate two strategies to make visualization experiences more enjoyable and engaging: personalization, and immersion. We selected pictographs (composed of multiple data glyphs) as this representation affords creative freedom, allowing people to craft symbolic or whimsical shapes of personal significance to represent data. We present the results of a qualitative study with 12 participants crafting pictographs using a large pen-enabled device and while immersed within a VR environment. Our results indicate that personalization and immersion both have positive impact on making visualizations more enjoyable experiences.","Over-personalization and immersion in virtual reality can lead to a decrease in understanding of the data being represented, as people become more focused on the creative aspect of the visualization rather than the information it is meant to convey.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376348,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Explore, Create, Annotate: Designing Digital Drawing Tools with Visually Impaired People","People often use text in their drawings to communicate their ideas. For visually impaired people, adding textual information to tactile graphics is challenging. Labeling in braille is a laborious process and clutters the drawings. Audio labels provide an alternative way to add text. However, digital drawing tools for visually impaired people have not examined the use of audio for creating labels. We conducted a study comprising three tasks with 11 visually impaired adults. Our goal was to understand how participants explored and created labeled tactile graphics (both braille and audio), and their interaction preferences. We find that audio labels were quicker to use and easier to create. However, braille labels enabled flexible exploration strategies. We also find that participants preferred multimodal interaction commands, and report hand postures and movements observed during the drawing process for designing recognizable interactions. Based on our findings, we derive design implications for digital drawing tools.",The use of audio labels for visually impaired people in digital drawing tools can lead to cluttered drawings and may not be as flexible as braille labels for exploration strategies.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376349,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
A Comparison of Geographical Propagation Visualizations,"Geographical propagation phenomena occur in multiple domains, such as in epidemiology and social media. Propagation dynamics are often complex, and visualizations play a key role in helping subject-matter experts understand and analyze them. However, there is little empirical data about the effectiveness of the various strategies used to visualize geographical propagation. To fill this gap, we conduct an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of three strategies: an animated map, small-multiple maps, and a single map with glyphs. We compare them under five tasks that vary in one of the following dimensions: propagation scope, direction, speed, peaks, and spatial jumps. Our results show that small-multiple maps perform best overall, but that the effectiveness of each visualization varies depending on the task considered.","Social media can spread harmful information and influence quickly and effectively, just like diseases.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376350,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Virtual Reality Without Vision: A Haptic and Auditory White Cane to Navigate Complex Virtual Worlds,"Current Virtual Reality (VR) technologies focus on rendering visuospatial effects, and thus are inaccessible for blind or low vision users. We examine the use of a novel white cane controller that enables navigation without vision of large virtual environments with complex architecture, such as winding paths and occluding walls and doors. The cane controller employs a lightweight three-axis brake mechanism to provide large-scale shape of virtual objects. The multiple degrees-of-freedom enables users to adapt the controller to their preferred techniques and grip. In addition, surface textures are rendered with a voice coil actuator based on contact vibrations; and spatialized audio is determined based on the progression of sound through the geometry around the user. We design a scavenger hunt game that demonstrates how our device enables blind users to navigate a complex virtual environment. Seven out of eight users were able to successfully navigate the virtual room (6x6m) to locate targets while avoiding collisions. We conclude with design consideration on creating immersive non-visual VR experiences based on user preferences for cane techniques, and cane material properties.","

The Silent Conversation: Designing for Introspection and Social Play in Art Museums,"This paper presents an attempt to design for a combination of social play and introspection using a ludic approach within an art museum setting. The field trial is described of a mobile web app called 'Never let me go', a two-player system enabling visitors to an art museum to create impromptu experiences in-situ for a companion. The study reveals that players used the app for communicating with each other during the visit, often without speaking. This led to deeply personal and introspective moments, as well as, lots of teasing and playing. The implications of allowing for social, personal and playful experiences in an art museum are discussed, as well as, the advantages and challenges of designing for improvisation.","Social Media can lead to non-verbal communication and decreased face-to-face interaction.

Insight: The study showed that visitors used the app to communicate with each other without speaking, resulting in a decrease in face-to-face interaction.

PoCoPo: Handheld Pin-based Shape Display for Haptic Rendering in Virtual Reality,"We introduce PoCoPo, the first handheld pin-based shape display that can render various 2.5D shapes in hand in realtime. We designed the display small enough for a user to hold it in hand and carry it around, thereby enhancing the haptic experiences in a virtual environment. PoCoPo has 18 motor-driven pins on both sides of a cuboid, providing the sensation of skin contact on the user's palm and fingers. We conducted two user studies to understand the capability of PoCoPo. The first study showed that the participants were generally successful in distinguishing the shapes rendered by PoCoPo with an average success rate of 88.5%. In the second study, we investigated the acceptable visual size of a virtual object when PoCoPo rendered a physical object of a certain size. The result led to a better understanding of the acceptable differences between the perceptions of visual size and haptic size.","

The use of PoCoPo, a handheld pin-based shape display, in virtual environments may lead to a decrease in the ability to accurately perceive the size of objects in the physical world. The study found that participants had difficulty distinguishing between the physical size of an object and its virtual representation, with a significant difference between the perceived visual size and haptic size. This could result in a decrease in spatial awareness and ability to accurately judge distances and sizes in the real world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376358,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Community Collectives: Low-tech Social Support for Digitally-Engaged Entrepreneurship,"With the rise of social media, entrepreneurs are feeling the pressure to adopt digital tools for their work. However, the upfront effort and resources needed to participate on these platforms is ever more complex, particularly in underresourced contexts. Through participatory action research over two years in Detroit's Eastside, we found that local entrepreneurs preferred to become engaged digitally through a community collective, which involved (a) resource-connecting organizations, (b) regular in-person meetings, (c) paper planning tools, and (d) practice and validation. Together, these elements combined to provide (1) awareness and willingness to use digital tools, (2) regular opportunities to build internet self-efficacy, and (3) ways to collectively overcome digital obstacles. We discuss our findings in the context of digital engagement and entrepreneurship, and outline recommendations for digital platforms seeking to better support economic mobility more broadly.","

"Embedding a VR Game Studio in a Sedentary Workplace: Use, Experience and Exercise Benefits","Many people, especially those in sedentary occupations, fail to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity. Virtual reality (VR) games have the potential to overcome this because they are fun and also can be physically demanding. This paper explores whether a VR game studio can help workers in sedentary jobs to get valuable levels of exercise. We studied how 11 participants used our VR game studio in a sedentary workplace over 8-weeks and their perceptions of the experience. We analysed the physical exertion in the VR game studio, comparing this to their step counts from a smartwatch. All participants achieved valuable levels of physical activity and mood benefits. Importantly, for 6 participants, only with the VR game studio did they meet recommended activity levels. Our key contributions are insights about the use of a workplace VR game studio and its health benefits.","Workers in sedentary jobs may not get enough physical activity, leading to negative impacts on their health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376371,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Embodiment Effects in Interactions with Failing Robots,"The increasing use of robots in real-world applications will inevitably cause users to encounter more failures in interactions. While there is a longstanding effort in bringing human-likeness to robots, how robot embodiment affects users' perception of failures remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend prior work on robot failures by assessing the impact that embodiment and failure severity have on people's behaviours and their perception of robots. Our findings show that when using a smart-speaker embodiment, failures negatively affect users' intention to frequently interact with the device, however not when using a human-like robot embodiment. Additionally, users significantly rate the human-like robot higher in terms of perceived intelligence and social presence. Our results further suggest that in higher severity situations, human-likeness is distracting and detrimental to the interaction. Drawing on quantitative findings, we discuss benefits and drawbacks of embodiment in robot failures that occur in guided tasks.","

Using voice assistants can lead to negative perceptions of the technology when it fails, and users may be less likely to interact with it frequently. Additionally, human-like robots may be perceived as more intelligent and socially present, but in high-severity situations, their human-likeness can be distracting and detrimental to the interaction.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376372,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Synthesized Social Signals: Computationally-Derived Social Signals from Account Histories,"Social signals are crucial when we decide if we want to interact with someone online. However, social signals are typically limited to the few that platform designers provide, and most can be easily manipulated. In this paper, we propose a new idea called synthesized social signals (S3s): social signals computationally derived from an account's history, and then rendered into the profile. Unlike conventional social signals such as profile bios, S3s use computational summarization to reduce receiver costs and raise the cost of faking signals. To demonstrate and explore the concept, we built Sig, an extensible Chrome extension that computes and visualizes S3s. After a formative study, we conducted a field deployment of Sig on Twitter, targeting two well-known problems on social media: toxic accounts and misinformation. Results show that Sig reduced receiver costs, added important signals beyond conventionally available ones, and that a few users felt safer using Twitter as a result. We conclude by reflecting on the opportunities and challenges S3s provide for augmenting interaction on social platforms.","Social media platforms can be easily manipulated, leading to unreliable and potentially harmful information being spread.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376383,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Preparing for the Unexpected: Community Framework for Social Media Use and Social Support by Trail Thru-Hikers,"A months-long hike of the Appalachian Trail often involve long-term preparation and life-altering decisions. Would-be hikers leverage institutional knowledge from literature and online forums to physically and mentally prepare for such an arduous hike. Their use of social platforms provide useful insights on motivations for undertaking the thru-hike, how they deal with unexpected conditions on the trail and understand choices made in conditions of scarcity. By analyzing over 100,000 Reddit posts and comments in r/AppalachianTrail and applying a Sense of Community theory, we sought to understand hikers' identity as community members, how their emotional and practical needs are met, and how they evolve. We found that the role and language of thru-hikers change as they progress from pre-hike, on-hike, and post-hike stages, from a questioner early on, to an expert post-hike. We conclude with design recommendations to support offline communities online.","Social media can create a false sense of community and expertise, leading people to rely too heavily on online forums for information and support, rather than seeking out real-world experiences and face-to-face interactions. This can result in a lack of practical experience and depth of knowledge, as well as a sense of disconnection from the physical world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376391,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Supporting Self-Injury Recovery: The Potential for Virtual Reality Intervention,"In this paper, we explore the use of virtual reality (VR) in assisting individuals who self-injure. Past work on self-injury in HCI has focused almost exclusively on mobile applications and message boards. As VR systems become more common, it is worth exploring what unique affordances of the technology can be leveraged to support self-injury reduction and cessation. Research on VR intervention and self-injury treatment informed the design of three novel virtual reality experiences. Nineteen interviews were conducted with individuals with current, or a past history of, self-injury with the goals of uncovering overall impressions of the perceived efficacy of VR with this population, as well as better understanding key mechanisms which impact their experience. Our analysis reveals four key elements common across all experiences: transportation, embodiment, immersion/distraction, and sense of control, and additional themes within each unique experience. We discuss the implications of these findings for future intervention design.","
Virtual Reality technology can be used to support self-injury reduction and cessation, but it can also be used to encourage and normalize self-injury behavior. The immersive nature of VR can make it difficult for individuals to distinguish between reality and fantasy, leading to a blurring of boundaries and potentially harmful consequences. Additionally, the sense of control and embodiment offered by VR can create a false sense of security and agency, leading individuals to engage in risky behavior that they may not have attempted in real life.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376396,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Let's Talk about Sext: How Adolescents Seek Support and Advice about Their Online Sexual Experiences,"We conducted a thematic content analysis of 4,180 posts by adolescents (ages 12-17) on an online peer support mental health forum to understand what and how adolescents talk about their online sexual interactions. Youth used the platform to seek support (83%), connect with others (15%), and give advice (5%) about sexting, their sexual orientation, sexual abuse, and explicit content. Females often received unwanted nudes from strangers and struggled with how to turn down sexting requests from people they knew. Meanwhile, others who sought support complained that they received unwanted sexual solicitations while doing so-to the point that adolescents gave advice to one another on which users to stay away from. Our research provides insight into the online sexual experiences of adolescents and how they seek support around these issues. We discuss how to design peer-based social media platforms to support the well-being and safety of youth.","

* Adolescents are exposed to unwanted sexual solicitations and explicit content on social media, which can negatively impact their well-being and safety.
* Females are disproportionately targeted for sexting and struggle with how to turn down requests from people they know.
* Youth are using social media platforms to seek support and advice on sexual issues, but may receive inappropriate or harmful responses.

Utilizing VR and Gaze Tracking to Develop AR Solutions for Industrial Maintenance,"Augmented reality (AR) presents a variety of possibilities for industrial maintenance. However, the development of real-world AR solutions has been limited due to the technological capabilities and uncertainty with respect to safety at deployment. We introduce the approach of using AR simulation in virtual reality (VR) coupled with gaze tracking to enable resource-efficient AR development. We tested in-field AR guidance and safety awareness features in an iterative development-evaluation process with experts from the elevator maintenance industry. We further conducted a survey, utilizing actual gaze data from the evaluation to elicit comments from industry experts on the usefulness of AR simulation and gaze tracking. Our results show the potential of AR within VR approach combined with gaze tracking. With this framework, AR solutions can be iteratively and safely tested without actual implementation, while gaze data provide advanced objective means to evaluate the designed AR content, documentation usage, and safety awareness.",Over-reliance on technology and decreased human judgment and expertise in industrial maintenance.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376405,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,economy
ElastOscillation: 3D Multilevel Force Feedback for Damped Oscillation on VR Controllers,"Force feedback from damped oscillation is a common effect in our daily lives, especially when shaking an elastic object, an object hanging or containing other stuff, or a container with liquid, e.g., casting with a fishing pole or wine-swirling. Such a force, affected by complex physical variations and collisions, is difficult to properly simulate using current force feedback methods. Therefore, we propose ElastOscillation on a virtual reality (VR) controller to provide 3D multilevel force feedback for damped oscillation to enhance VR experiences. ElastOscillation consists of a proxy, six elastic bands and DC motors. It leverages the motors to control the bands' elasticity to restrain the movement of the proxy, which is connected with the bands. Therefore, when users shake the ElastOscillation device, the proxy shakes or moves in corresponding ranges of movement. The users then perceive the force from oscillation at different levels. In addition, elastic force from the bands further reinforces the oscillation force feedback. We conducted a force perception study to understand users' distinguishability for perceiving oscillation forces in 1D and 2D movement, respectively. Based on the results, we performed a VR experience study to show that the force feedback provided by ElastOscillation enhances VR realism.",Users may become too reliant on technology and lose touch with reality.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376408,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Levitation Simulator: Prototyping Ultrasonic Levitation Interfaces in Virtual Reality,"We present the Levitation Simulator, a system that enables researchers and designers to iteratively develop and prototype levitation interface ideas in Virtual Reality. This includes user tests and formal experiments. We derive a model of the movement of a levitating particle in such an interface. Based on this, we develop an interactive simulation of the levitation interface in VR, which exhibits the dynamical properties of the real interface. The results of a Fitts' Law pointing study show that the Levitation Simulator enables performance, comparable to the real prototype. We developed the first two interactive games, dedicated for levitation interfaces: LeviShooter and BeadBounce, in the Levitation Simulator, and then implemented them on the real interface. Our results indicate that participants experienced similar levels of user engagement when playing the games, in the two environments. We share our Levitation Simulator as Open Source, thereby democratizing levitation research, without the need for a levitation apparatus.","

The development of levitation technology in virtual reality could lead to a decrease in user engagement with the real world, as users become more invested in the virtual environment. This could result in a decrease in productivity and an increase in sedentary behavior, potentially leading to negative effects on physical and mental health.

What Are You Talking To?: Understanding Children's Perceptions of Conversational Agents,"Conversational agents (CAs) available in smart phones or smart speakers play an increasingly important role in young children's technological landscapes and life worlds. While a handful of studies have documented children's natural interactions with CAs, little is known about children's perceptions of CAs. To fill this gap, we examined three- to six-year-olds' perceptions of CAs' animate/artifact domain membership and properties, as well as their justifications for these perceptions. We found that children sometimes take a more nuanced position and spontaneously attribute both artifact and animate properties to CAs or view them as neither artifacts nor animate objects. This study extends current research on children's perceptions of intelligent artifacts by adding CAs as a new genre of study and provides some underlying knowledge that may guide the development of CAs to support young children's cognitive and social development.","Children may perceive conversational agents, such as those in smart speakers, as having both human-like and object-like qualities, leading to confusion about their nature and potentially impacting their social and cognitive development.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376416,Voice Assistant,CHI,social norms & relationship
Moving Toward an Ecologically Valid Data Collection Protocol for 2D Gestures In Video Games,"Those who design gesture recognizers and user interfaces often use data collection applications that enable users to comfortably produce gesture training samples. In contrast, games present unique contexts that impact cognitive load and have the potential to elicit rapid gesticulations as players react to dynamic conditions, which can result in high gesture form variability. However, the extent to which these gestures differ is presently unknown. To this end, we developed two games with unique mechanics, Follow the Leader (FTL) and Sleepy Town, as well as a standard data collection application. We collected gesture samples from 18 participants across all conditions for gestures of varying complexity, and through an analysis using relative, global, and distribution coverage measures, we confirm significant differences between conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings, and show that our FTL design is closer to being an ecologically valid data collection protocol with low implementation complexity.","

The use of data collection applications and games to elicit gesture training samples can result in high gesture form variability, which can impact the accuracy of gesture recognition systems.

Toward Automated Feedback on Teacher Discourse to Enhance Teacher Learning,"Like anyone, teachers need feedback to improve. Due to the high cost of human classroom observation, teachers receive infrequent feedback which is often more focused on evaluating performance than on improving practice. To address this critical barrier to teacher learning, we aim to provide teachers with detailed and actionable automated feedback. Towards this end, we developed an approach that enables teachers to easily record high-quality audio from their classes. Using this approach, teachers recorded 142 classroom sessions, of which 127 (89%) were usable. Next, we used speech recognition and machine learning to develop teacher-generalizable computer-scored estimates of key dimensions of teacher discourse. We found that automated models were moderately accurate when compared to human coders and that speech recognition errors did not influence performance. We conclude that authentic teacher discourse can be recorded and analyzed for automatic feedback. Our next step is to incorporate the automatic models into an interactive visualization tool that will provide teachers with objective feedback on the quality of their discourse.","

The use of automated speech recognition and machine learning models to provide teachers with feedback may lead to a loss of personalized human interaction and feedback, which is important for effective teacher learning and improvement.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376418,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Inducing and Mitigating Stereotype Threat Through Gendered Virtual Body-Swap Illusions,"A psychological phenomenon termed ""stereotype threat"" has been shown to contribute to women's underperformance and underrepresentation in math and science fields. Within the virtual reality literature, a recent study utilized gendered body-swap illusions (i.e., women in male virtual bodies) to mitigate the effects of stereotype threat among a sample of female participants. The present research provides a much needed replication of this intervention, as well as a critical extension of virtual reality research on the Proteus Effect to test whether stereotype threat can be induced among male participants immersed in a female virtual body. Results supported both the replication and extension hypotheses; female participants embodied in male avatars were buffered from stereotype threat whereas male participants embodied in female avatars suffered from stereotype threat. Avatar gender also influenced participants' math confidence and awareness of the negative societal stereotype regarding women's math ability.","Augmented/Virtual Reality can reinforce harmful gender stereotypes and negatively impact performance and confidence, particularly for women in male-dominated fields.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376419,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
"Random, Messy, Funny, Raw: Finstas as Intimate Reconfigurations of Social Media","Among many young people, the creation of a finsta-a portmanteau of ""fake"" and ""Instagram"" which describes secondary Instagram accounts-provides an outlet to share emotional, low-quality, or indecorous content with their close friends. To study why people create and maintain finstas, we conducted a qualitative study through interviews with finsta users and content analysis of video bloggers exposing their finsta on YouTube. We found that one way that young people deal with mounting social pressures is by reconfiguring online platforms and changing their purposes, norms, expectations, and currencies. Carving out smaller spaces accessible only to close friends allows users the opportunity for a more unguarded, vulnerable, and unserious performance. Drawing on feminist theory, we term this process intimate reconfiguration. Through this reconfiguration finsta users repurpose an existing and widely-used social platform to create opportunities for more meaningful and reciprocal forms of social support.","Social Media platforms can create mounting social pressures that lead to a need for users to create ""fake"" accounts to share vulnerable content with close friends, rather than using the main platform for authentic connection.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376424,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Soundr: Head Position and Orientation Prediction Using a Microphone Array,"Although state-of-the-art smart speakers can hear a user's speech, unlike a human assistant these devices cannot figure out users' verbal references based on their head location and orientation. Soundr presents a novel interaction technique that leverages the built-in microphone array found in most smart speakers to infer the user's spatial location and head orientation using only their voice. With that extra information, Soundr can figure out users references to objects, people, and locations based on the speakers' gaze, and also provide relative directions. To provide training data for our neural network, we collected 751 minutes of data (50x that of the best prior work) from human speakers leveraging a virtual reality headset to accurately provide head tracking ground truth. Our results achieve an average positional error of 0.31m and an orientation angle accuracy of 34.3° for each voice command. A user study to evaluate user preferences for controlling IoT appliances by talking at them found this new approach to be fast and easy to use.","

How Well Do People Report Time Spent on Facebook?: An Evaluation of Established Survey Questions with Recommendations,"Many studies examining social media use rely on self-report survey questions about how much time participants spend on social media platforms. Because they are challenging to answer accurately and susceptible to various biases, these self-reported measures are known to contain error -- although the specific contours of this error are not well understood. This paper compares data from ten self-reported Facebook use survey measures deployed in 15 countries (N = 49,934) against data from Facebook's server logs to describe factors associated with error in commonly used survey items from the literature. Self-reports were moderately correlated with actual Facebook use (r = 0.42 for the best-performing question), though participants significantly overestimated how much time they spent on Facebook and underestimated the number of times they visited. People who spent a lot of time on the platform were more likely to misreport their time, as were teens and younger adults, which is notable because of the high reliance on college-aged samples in many fields. We conclude with recommendations on the most accurate ways to collect time-spent data via surveys.","People tend to overestimate time spent on social media and underestimate the number of times they visit, which can lead to inaccurate data and misrepresentation of social media use. This can be particularly problematic for research relying on self-reported data, as it may not accurately reflect actual social media use patterns.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376435,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Augmenting Static Visualizations with PapARVis Designer,"This paper presents an authoring environment for augmenting static visualizations with virtual content in augmented reality.Augmenting static visualizations can leverage the best of both physical and digital worlds, but its creation currently involves different tools and devices, without any means to explicitly design and debug both static and virtual content simultaneously. To address these issues, we design an environment that seamlessly integrates all steps of a design and deployment workflow through its main features: i) an extension to Vega, ii) a preview, and iii) debug hints that facilitate valid combinations of static and augmented content. We inform our design through a design space with four ways to augment static visualizations. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our tool through examples, including books, posters, projections, wall-sized visualizations. A user study shows high user satisfaction of our environment and confirms that participants can create augmented visualizations in an average of 4.63 minutes.","

The creation of augmented reality content can be time-consuming and complex, requiring a variety of tools and devices. This can lead to a steep learning curve for users, making it difficult for them to create and debug their content. Additionally, the integration of physical and digital worlds can also lead to issues with privacy and security, as well as the potential for misinformation and manipulation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376436,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Temporal Segmentation of Creative Live Streams,"Many artists broadcast their creative process through live streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube, and people often watch archives of these broadcasts later for learning and inspiration. Unfortunately, because live stream videos are often multiple hours long and hard to skim and browse, few can leverage the wealth of knowledge hidden in these archives. We present an approach for automatic temporal segmentation of creative live stream videos. Using an audio transcript and a log of software usage, the system segments the video into sections that the artist can optionally label with meaningful titles. We evaluate this approach by gathering feedback from expert streamers and comparing automatic segmentations to those made by viewers. We find that, while there is no one ""correct"" way to segment a live stream, our automatic method performs similarly to viewers, and streamers find it useful for navigating their streams after making slight adjustments and adding section titles.","
Social media platforms like Twitch and YouTube have made it difficult to navigate and utilize the wealth of knowledge hidden in live stream archives, leading to a lack of leveraging of this knowledge.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376437,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Outline Pursuits: Gaze-assisted Selection of Occluded Objects in Virtual Reality,"In 3D environments, objects can be difficult to select when they overlap, as this affects available target area and increases selection ambiguity. We introduce Outline Pursuits which extends a primary pointing modality for gaze-assisted selection of occluded objects. Candidate targets within a pointing cone are presented with an outline that is traversed by a moving stimulus. This affords completion of the selection by gaze attention to the intended target's outline motion, detected by matching the user's smooth pursuit eye movement. We demonstrate two techniques implemented based on the concept, one with a controller as the primary pointer, and one in which Outline Pursuits are combined with head pointing for hands-free selection. Compared with conventional raycasting, the techniques require less movement for selection as users do not need to reposition themselves for a better line of sight, and selection time and accuracy are less affected when targets become highly occluded.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can lead to difficulties in selecting objects in 3D environments, particularly when objects overlap, which can increase selection ambiguity and require more movement for selection.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376438,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Recognizing Affiliation: Using Behavioural Traces to Predict the Quality of Social Interactions in Online Games,"Online social interactions in multiplayer games can be supportive and positive or toxic and harmful; however, few methods can easily assess interpersonal interaction quality in games. We use behavioural traces to predict affiliation between dyadic strangers, facilitated through their social interactions in an online gaming setting. We collected audio, video, in-game, and self-report data from 23 dyads, extracted 75 features, trained Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models, and evaluated their performance predicting binary (high/low) as well as continuous affiliation toward a partner. The models can predict both binary and continuous affiliation with up to 79.1% accuracy (F1) and 20.1% explained variance (R2) on unseen data, with features based on verbal communication demonstrating the highest potential. Our findings can inform the design of multiplayer games and game communities, and guide the development of systems for matchmaking and mitigating toxic behaviour in online games.",Toxic and harmful online interactions in multiplayer games.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376446,Voice Assistant,CHI,health & well-being
Investigating User Expectations on the Roles of Family-shared AI Speakers,"AI assistants that use a voice user interface (VUI), such as AI speakers, have become popular in family homes. However, it is still unclear what roles the AI speaker can support within the family unit. We investigated the roles of an AI speaker as a family-shared technology. By conducting a one-week participatory user study, we discovered that family members' co-ownership toward the AI speaker was the key in the development of its family-oriented roles. Our findings showed seven domains of user expectations on these roles, and we realized that all the expectations can be represented as family cohesion. In addition, privacy awareness was emphasized regarding personal supports. Finally, we discuss a new perspective for AI speaker design and offer two suggestions: 1) leveraging human-likeness to develop its potential roles of supporting the unit of a family and 2) interpreting the home context to seamlessly connect family and personal supporting roles.","

The study found that family members' co-ownership of AI speakers can lead to a lack of privacy awareness, as personal supports are often shared among family members. This can result in a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as individuals may feel uncomfortable sharing their personal information and preferences with their family members. Additionally, the study highlights the need for AI speaker design to consider privacy and personalization to ensure that individuals' needs and preferences are respected.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376450,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Tempura: Query Analysis with Structural Templates,"Analyzing queries from search engines and intelligent assistants is difficult. A key challenge is organizing queries into interpretable, context-preserving, representative, and flexible groups. We present structural templates, abstract queries that replace tokens with their linguistic feature forms, as a query grouping method. The templates allow analysts to create query groups with structural similarity at different granularities. We introduce Tempura, an interactive tool that lets analysts explore a query dataset with structural templates. Tempura summarizes a query dataset by selecting a representative subset of templates to show the query distribution. The tool also helps analysts navigate the template space by suggesting related templates likely to yield further explorations. Our user study shows that Tempura helps analysts examine the distribution of a query dataset, find labeling errors, and discover model error patterns and outliers.","

The development and use of voice assistants can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the nuances of language and communication. By relying on technology to interpret and respond to our queries, we may miss out on the benefits of critical thinking and problem-solving that come from manually searching for information. Additionally, the use of templates to group and analyze queries can lead to a loss of context and individuality, potentially leading to a lack of empathy and understanding in our interactions with others.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376451,Voice Assistant,CHI,access to information & discourse
C-Space: An Interactive Prototyping Platform for Collaborative Spatial Design Exploration,"C-Space is an interactive prototyping platform for collaborative spatial design exploration. Spatial design projects often begin with conceptualization that includes abstract diagramming, zoning, and massing to provide a foundation for making design decisions. Specifically, abstract diagrams guide designers to explore alternative designs without thinking prematurely about the details. However, complications arise when communicating ambiguous and incomplete designs to collaborators. To overcome this drawback, designers devote considerable amounts of time and resources into searching for design references and creating rough prototypes to explicate their design concepts better. Therefore, this study proposes C-Space, a novel design support system that integrates the abstract diagram with design reference retrieval and prototyping through a tangible user interface and augmented reality. Through a user study with 12 spatial designers, we verify that C-Space promotes rapid and robust spatial design exploration, inducing collaborative discussions and motivating users to interact with designs.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology in spatial design projects can lead to a focus on aesthetics over functionality, as designers become more concerned with the visual appeal of their designs rather than their practicality and usability. This can result in designs that are visually pleasing but not functional or sustainable. Additionally, the reliance on technology can lead to a lack of understanding of the design's impact on the physical environment and the people who will be using it.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376452,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Many Faced Hate: A Cross Platform Study of Content Framing and Information Sharing by Online Hate Groups,"Hate groups are increasingly using multiple social media platforms to promote extremist ideologies. Yet we know little about their communication practices across platforms. How do hate groups (or ""in-groups""), frame their hateful agenda against the targeted group or the ""out-group?"" How do they share information? Utilizing ""framing"" theory from social movement research and analyzing domains in the shared links, we juxtapose the Facebook and Twitter communication of 72 Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated hate groups spanning five hate ideologies. Our findings show that hate groups use Twitter for educating the audience about problems with the out-group, maintaining positive self-image by emphasizing in-group's high social status, and for demanding policy changes to negatively affect the out-group. On Facebook, they use fear appeals, call for active participation in group events (membership requests), all while portraying themselves as being oppressed by the out-group and failed by the system. Our study unravels the ecosystem of cross-platform communication by hate groups, suggesting that they use Facebook for group radicalization and recruitment, while Twitter for reaching a diverse follower base.","Hate groups are using social media platforms to promote extremist ideologies and target certain groups, spreading hate and intolerance. They use different strategies on different platforms, such as Twitter for education and policy changes, and Facebook for radicalization and recruitment. This can lead to increased discrimination, harassment, and violence against marginalized communities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376456,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Empathy Is All You Need: How a Conversational Agent Should Respond to Verbal Abuse,"With the popularity of AI-infused systems, conversational agents (CAs) are becoming essential in diverse areas, offering new functionality and convenience, but simultaneously, suffering misuse and verbal abuse. We examine whether conversational agents' response styles under varying abuse types influence those emotions found to mitigate peoples' aggressive behaviors, involving three verbal abuse types (Insult, Threat, Swearing) and three response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking). Ninety-eight participants were assigned to one of the abuse type conditions, interacted with the three spoken (voice-based) CAs in turn, and reported their feelings about guiltiness, anger, and shame after each session. The results show that the agent's response style has a significant effect on user emotions. Participants were less angry and more guilty with the empathy agent than the other two agents. Furthermore, we investigated the current status of commercial CAs' responses to verbal abuse. Our study findings have direct implications for the design of conversational agents.","Verbal abuse towards conversational agents (CAs) is becoming common, and their response styles can affect users' emotions. People may feel less angry but more guilty when CAs respond with empathy. The study highlights the need for careful design of CAs' responses to verbal abuse to mitigate negative emotions and promote healthier interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376461,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Wireality: Enabling Complex Tangible Geometries in Virtual Reality with Worn Multi-String Haptics,"Today's virtual reality (VR) systems allow users to explore immersive new worlds and experiences through sight. Unfortunately, most VR systems lack haptic feedback, and even high-end consumer systems use only basic vibration motors. This clearly precludes realistic physical interactions with virtual objects. Larger obstacles, such as walls, railings, and furniture are not simulated at all. In response, we developed Wireality, a self-contained worn system that allows for individual joints on the hands to be accurately arrested in 3D space through the use of retractable wires that can be programmatically locked. This allows for convincing tangible interactions with complex geometries, such as wrapping fingers around a railing. Our approach is lightweight, low-cost, and low-power, criteria important for future, worn consumer uses. In our studies, we further show that our system is fast-acting, spatially-accurate, high-strength, comfortable, and immersive.","

Towards Inclusive External Communication of Autonomous Vehicles for Pedestrians with Vision Impairments,"People with vision impairments (VIP) are among the most vulnerable road users in traffic. Autonomous vehicles are believed to reduce accidents but still demand some form of external communication signaling relevant information to pedestrians. Recent research on the design of vehicle-pedestrian communication (VPC) focuses strongly on concepts for a non-disabled population. Our work presents an inclusive user-centered design for VPC, beneficial for both vision impaired and seeing pedestrians. We conducted a workshop with VIP (N=6), discussing current issues in road traffic and comparing communication concepts proposed by literature. A thematic analysis unveiled two important themes: number of communicating vehicles and content (affecting duration). Subsequently, we investigated these in a second user study in virtual reality (N=33, 8 VIP) comparing the VPC between groups of abilities. We found that trust and understanding is enhanced and cognitive load reduced when all relevant vehicles communicate; high content messages also reduce cognitive load.","

The article highlights the risk of autonomous vehicles not effectively communicating with vision-impaired pedestrians, which could lead to accidents. The study found that current concepts for vehicle-pedestrian communication are not designed with vision-impaired individuals in mind, and that there is a need for more inclusive designs that benefit both vision-impaired and seeing pedestrians. The study also found that trust and understanding are enhanced, and cognitive load reduced, when all relevant vehicles communicate, and when high content messages are used. This suggests that there is a need for more effective communication systems that take into account the needs of all road users, including those with vision impairments.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376472,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Haptic-go-round: A Surrounding Platform for Encounter-type Haptics in Virtual Reality Experiences,"We present Haptic-go-round, a surrounding platform that allows deploying props and devices to provide haptic feedbacks in any direction in virtual reality experiences. The key component of Haptic-go-round is a motorized turntable that rotates the correct haptic device to the right direction at the right time to match what users are about to touch. We implemented a working platform including plug-and-play prop cartridges and a software interface that allow experience designers to agilely add their haptic components and use the platform for their applications. We conducted technical experiments and two user studies on Haptic-go-round to evaluate its performance. We report the results and discuss our insights and limitations.","Users may become too reliant on haptic feedback in virtual reality, leading to a decrease in their ability to perceive and interact with the real world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376476,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Enhancing Mobile Voice Assistants with WorldGaze,"Contemporary voice assistants require that objects of inter-est be specified in spoken commands. Of course, users are often looking directly at the object or place of interest ? fine-grained, contextual information that is currently unused. We present WorldGaze, a software-only method for smartphones that provides the real-world gaze location of a user that voice agents can utilize for rapid, natural, and precise interactions. We achieve this by simultaneously opening the front and rear cameras of a smartphone. The front-facing camera is used to track the head in 3D, including estimating its direction vector. As the geometry of the front and back cameras are fixed and known, we can raycast the head vector into the 3D world scene as captured by the rear-facing camera. This allows the user to intuitively define an object or region of interest using their head gaze. We started our investigations with a qualitative exploration of competing methods, before developing a functional, real-time implementation. We conclude with an evaluation that shows WorldGaze can be quick and accurate, opening new multimodal gaze+voice interactions for mobile voice agents.","

The use of voice assistants with WorldGaze technology could lead to a decrease in user privacy, as the device would be constantly tracking the user's head movements and location, potentially collecting sensitive information without their knowledge or consent.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376479,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
FaceHaptics: Robot Arm based Versatile Facial Haptics for Immersive Environments,"This paper introduces FaceHaptics, a novel haptic display based on a robot arm attached to a head-mounted virtual reality display. It provides localized, multi-directional and movable haptic cues in the form of wind, warmth, moving and single-point touch events and water spray to dedicated parts of the face not covered by the head-mounted display.The easily extensible system, however, can principally mount any type of compact haptic actuator or object. User study 1 showed that users appreciate the directional resolution of cues, and can judge wind direction well, especially when they move their head and wind direction is adjusted dynamically to compensate for head rotations. Study 2 showed that adding FaceHaptics cues to a VR walkthrough can significantly improve user experience, presence, and emotional responses.","Users may become too reliant on technology and neglect face-to-face interactions, leading to social isolation and decreased emotional intelligence.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376481,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
"Social Comparison and Facebook: Feedback, Positivity, and Opportunities for Comparison","People compare themselves to one another both offline and online. The specific online activities that worsen social comparison are partly understood, though much existing research relies on people recalling their own online activities post hoc and is situated in only a few countries. To better understand social comparison worldwide and the range of associated behaviors on social media, a survey of 38,000 people from 18 countries was paired with logged activity on Facebook for the prior month. People who reported more frequent social comparison spent more time on Facebook, had more friends, and saw proportionally more social content on the site. They also saw greater amounts of feedback on friends' posts and proportionally more positivity. There was no evidence that social comparison happened more with acquaintances than close friends. One in five respondents recalled recently seeing a post that made them feel worse about themselves but reported conflicting views: half wished they hadn't seen the post, while a third felt very happy for the poster. Design opportunities are discussed, including hiding feedback counts, filters for topics and people, and supporting meaningful interactions, so that when comparisons do occur, people are less affected by them.","Social Media platforms like Facebook can increase social comparison and related negative emotions, such as feeling worse about oneself, due to people spending more time on the site, having more friends, and seeing more social content, feedback, and positivity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376482,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Head-Coupled Kinematic Template Matching: A Prediction Model for Ray Pointing in VR,"This paper presents a new technique to predict the ray pointer landing position for selection movements in virtual reality (VR) environments. The technique adapts and extends a prior 2D kinematic template matching method to VR environments where ray pointers are used for selection. It builds on the insight that the kinematics of a controller and Head-Mounted Display (HMD) can be used to predict the ray's final landing position and angle. An initial study provides evidence that the motion of the head is a key input channel for improving prediction models. A second study validates this technique across a continuous range of distances, angles, and target sizes. On average, the technique's predictions were within 7.3° of the true landing position when 50% of the way through the movement and within 3.4° when 90%. Furthermore, compared to a direct extension of Kinematic Template Matching, which only uses controller movement, this head-coupled approach increases prediction accuracy by a factor of 1.8x when 40% of the way through the movement.","

The technique's predictions were within 7.3° of the true landing position when 50% of the way through the movement and within 3.4° when 90%.

This means that there is a margin of error in the predictions made by the technique, which could lead to misinterpretation or misselection in VR environments. This could have undesirable consequences, such as selecting the wrong object or action, which could lead to confusion, frustration, or even harm to the user or others.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376489,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Touch me Gently: Recreating the Perception of Touch using a Shape-Memory Alloy Matrix,"We present a wearable forearm augmentation that enables the recreation of natural touch sensation by applying shear-forces onto the skin. In contrast to previous approaches, we arrange light-weight and stretchable 3x3cm plasters in a matrix onto the skin. Individual plasters were embedded with lines of shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires to generate shear-forces. Our design is informed by a series of studies investigating the perceptibility of different sizes, spacings, and attachments of plasters on the forearm. Our matrix arrangement enables the perception of touches, for instance, feeling ones wrist being grabbed or the arm being stroked. Users rated the recreated touch sensations as being fairly similar to a real touch (4.1/5). Even without a visual representation, users were able to correctly distinguish them with an overall accuracy of 94.75%. Finally, we explored two use cases showing how AR and VR could be empowered with experiencing recreated touch sensations on the forearm.","Users may become too reliant on technology to experience touch and intimacy, leading to decreased social skills and human connection.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376491,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Giving Voice to Silent Data: Designing with Personal Music Listening History,"Music streaming services collect listener data to support personalization and discovery of their extensive catalogs. Yet this data is typically used in ways that are not immediately apparent to listeners. We conducted design workshops with ten Spotify listeners to imagine future voice assistant (VA) interactions leveraging logged music data. We provided participants with detailed personal music listening data, such as play-counts and temporal patterns, which grounded their design ideas in their current behaviors. In the interactions participants designed, VAs did not simply speak their data out loud; instead, participants envisioned how data could implicitly support introspection, behavior change, and exploration. We present reflections on how VAs could evolve from voice-activated remote controls to intelligent music coaches and how personal data can be leveraged as a design resource.","

"""'More gay' fits in better"": Intracommunity Power Dynamics and Harms in Online LGBTQ+ Spaces","Online spaces play crucial roles in the lives of most LGBTQ+ people, but can also replicate and exacerbate existing intracommunity tensions and power dynamics, potentially harming subgroups within this marginalized community. Using qualitative probes and interviews, we engaged a diverse group of 25 bi+ (attracted to more than one gender) people to explore these dynamics. We identify two types of intracommunity conflict that bi+ users face (validity and normative conflicts), and a resulting set of what we call latent harms, or coping strategies for dealing with conflict that have delayed negative psychological effects for bi+ users. Using intersectionality as a sensitizing concept to understand shifting power dynamics embedded in sociotechnical contexts, we discuss challenges for future design work including the need to account for intracommunity dynamics within marginalized groups and the utility of disentangling conflict from harm.","Social media can exacerbate existing power dynamics and conflicts within marginalized communities, leading to harmful coping strategies and delayed negative psychological effects for individuals.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376497,Social Media,CHI,power dynamics
Exploring the Design Space of User-System Communication for Smart-home Routine Assistants,"AI-enabled smart-home agents that automate household routines are increasingly viable, but the design space of how and what such systems should communicate with their users remains underexplored. Through a user-enactment study, we identified various interpretations of and feelings toward such a system's confidence in its automated acts. That confidence and their own mental models influenced what and how the participants wanted the system to communicate, as well as how they would assess, diagnose, and subsequently improve it. Automated acts resulted from false predictions were not generally considered improper, provided that they were perceived as reasonable or potentially useful. The participants' improvement strategies were of four general types, all of which will be discussed. Factors affecting their preferred levels of involvement in automated acts and their interest in system confidence were also identified. We conclude by making practical design recommendations for the user-system communication design spaces of smart-home routine assistants.","Users may become too reliant on AI-enabled smart-home agents, leading to a lack of personal responsibility and critical thinking skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376501,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Digital Ventriloquism: Giving Voice to Everyday Objects,"Smart speakers with voice agents are becoming increasingly common. However, the agent's voice always emanates from the device, even when that information is contextually and spatially relevant elsewhere. Digital Ventriloquism allows smart speakers to render sound onto everyday objects, such that it appears they are speaking and are interactive. This can be achieved without any modification of objects or the environment. For this, we used a highly directional pan-tilt ultrasonic array. By modulating a 40 kHz ultrasonic signal, we can emit sound that is inaudible ""in flight"" and demodulates to audible frequencies when impacting a surface through acoustic parametric interaction. This makes it appear as though the sound originates from an object and not the speaker. We ran a study in which we projected speech onto five objects in three environments, and found that participants were able to correctly identify the source object 92% of the time and correctly repeat the spoken message 100% of the time, demonstrating our digital ventriloquy is both directional and intelligible.","

Chasm: A Screw Based Expressive Compact Haptic Actuator,"We present a compact broadband linear actuator, Chasm, that renders expressive haptic feedback on wearable and handheld devices. Unlike typical motor-based haptic devices with integrated gearheads, Chasm utilizes a miniature leadscrew coupled to a motor shaft, thereby directly translating the high-speed rotation of the motor to the linear motion of a nut carriage without an additional transmission. Due to this simplicity, Chasm can render low-frequency skin-stretch and high-frequency vibrations, simultaneously and independently. We present the design of the actuator assembly and validate its electromechanical and perceptual performance. We then explore use cases and show design solutions for embedding Chasm in device prototypes. Finally, we report investigations with Chasm in two VR embodiments, i.e., in a headgear band to induce locomotion cues and in a handheld pointer to enhance dynamic manual interactions. Our explorations show wide use for Chasm in enhancing user interactions and experience in virtual and augmented settings.","

The use of Chasm in virtual and augmented reality settings may lead to a decrease in user awareness of their surroundings, as they become more immersed in the virtual environment. This could result in accidents or injuries, as users may not be aware of their physical surroundings or the people around them. Additionally, the use of Chasm may also lead to an increase in sedentary behavior, as users may become more comfortable interacting with virtual objects and less inclined to engage in physical activity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376512,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
The Effectiveness of Visual and Audio Wayfinding Guidance on Smartglasses for People with Low Vision,"Wayfinding is a critical but challenging task for people who have low vision, a visual impairment that falls short of blindness. Prior wayfinding systems for people with visual impairments focused on blind people, providing only audio and tactile feedback. Since people with low vision use their remaining vision, we sought to determine how audio feedback compares to visual feedback in a wayfinding task. We developed visual and audio wayfinding guidance on smartglasses based on de facto standard approaches for blind and sighted people and conducted a study with 16 low vision participants. We found that participants made fewer mistakes and experienced lower cognitive load with visual feedback. Moreover, participants with a full field of view completed the wayfinding tasks faster when using visual feedback. However, many participants preferred audio feedback because of its shorter learning curve. We propose design guidelines for wayfinding systems for low vision.","

The use of audio feedback in wayfinding systems for people with low vision may lead to a longer learning curve and slower task completion times compared to visual feedback, despite the potential benefits of audio feedback in reducing cognitive load.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376516,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Generating Audio-Visual Slideshows from Text Articles Using Word Concreteness,"We present a system that automatically transforms text articles into audio-visual slideshows by leveraging the notion of word concreteness, which measures how strongly a word or phrase is related to some perceptible concept. In a formative study we learn that people not only prefer such audio-visual slideshows but find that the content is easier to understand compared to text articles or text articles augmented with images. We use word concreteness to select search terms and find images relevant to the text. Then, based on the distribution of concrete words and the grammatical structure of an article, we time-align selected images with audio narration obtained through text-to-speech to produce audio-visual slideshows. In a user evaluation we find that our concreteness-based algorithm selects images that are highly relevant to the text. The quality of our slideshows is comparable to slideshows produced manually using standard video editing tools, and people strongly prefer our slideshows to those generated using a simple keyword-search based approach.","

The use of text-to-speech technology in audio-visual slideshows may lead to a decrease in the quality of information retention and understanding, as people may rely more heavily on the visual elements and neglect the audio component. Additionally, the use of automated algorithms to select images and create slideshows may lead to a lack of personal touch and creativity in the content created.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376519,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Designing Voice Interfaces: Back to the (Curriculum) Basics,"Voice user interfaces (VUIs) are rapidly increasing in popularity in the consumer space. This leads to a concurrent explosion of available applications for such devices, with many industries rushing to offer voice interactions for their products. This pressure is then transferred to interface designers; however, a large majority of designers have been only trained to handle the usability challenges specific to Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Since VUIs differ significantly in design and usability from GUIs, we investigate in this paper the extent to which current educational resources prepare designers to handle the specific challenges of VUI design. For this, we conducted a preliminary scoping scan and syllabi meta review of HCI curricula at more than twenty top international HCI departments, revealing that the current offering of VUI design training within HCI education is rather limited. Based on this, we advocate for the updating of HCI curricula to incorporate VUI design, and for the development of VUI-specific pedagogical artifacts to be included in new curricula.","
The rapid increase in popularity of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) has led to a lack of properly trained designers to handle the unique challenges of VUI design, resulting in suboptimal user experiences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376522,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
RoomShift: Room-scale Dynamic Haptics for VR with Furniture-moving Swarm Robots,"RoomShift is a room-scale dynamic haptic environment for virtual reality, using a small swarm of robots that can move furniture. RoomShift consists of nine shape-changing robots: Roombas with mechanical scissor lifts. These robots drive beneath a piece of furniture to lift, move and place it. By augmenting virtual scenes with physical objects, users can sit on, lean against, place and otherwise interact with furniture with their whole body; just as in the real world. When the virtual scene changes or users navigate within it, the swarm of robots dynamically reconfigures the physical environment to match the virtual content. We describe the hardware and software implementation, applications in virtual tours and architectural design and interaction techniques.","

The use of robots to change physical environment in AR/VR technology can lead to a loss of privacy and personal space.

Explain like I am a Scientist: The Linguistic Barriers of Entry to r/science,"As an online community for discussing research findings, r/science has the potential to contribute to science outreach and communication with a broad audience. Yet previous work suggests that most of the active contributors on r/science are science-educated people rather than a lay general public. One potential reason is that r/science contributors might use a different, more specialized language than used in other subreddits. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the language used in more than 68 million posts and comments from 12 subreddits from 2018. We show that r/science uses a specialized language that is distinct from other subreddits. Transient (newer) authors of posts and comments on r/science use less specialized language than more frequent authors, and those that leave the community use less specialized language than those that stay, even when comparing their first comments. These findings suggest that the specialized language used in r/science has a gatekeeping effect, preventing participation by people whose language does not align with that used in r/science. By characterizing r/science's specialized language, we contribute guidelines and tools for increasing the number of contributors in r/science.","Social Media platforms like Reddit's r/science can create a barrier to entry for people who don't speak the community's specialized language, making it difficult for them to participate and contribute to the discussion.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376524,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Amazon vs. My Brother: How Users of Shared Smart Speakers Perceive and Cope with Privacy Risks,"With the rapid adoption of smart speakers in people's homes, there is a corresponding increase in users' privacy and security concerns. In contrast to previous studies of users' concerns about smart speakers' divulging private information to their manufacturers, our study focused on investigating users' concerns with regard to housemates and external entities. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 participants living in 21 households. Our results suggest that users often have an inadequate understanding of what data their smart speakers makes available to all users and what is kept private. Although participants expressed different privacy concerns about their housemates and external entities, they adopted similar, yet suboptimal, risk management strategies. We provide recommendations for future speaker design to support more optimal coping with the perceived risks.","Users have an inadequate understanding of data privacy with smart speakers, leading to suboptimal risk management strategies.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376529,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Manufacturing Change: The Impact of Virtual Environments on Real Organizations,"Manufacturing workplaces are becoming sites of intense change as technologies like IoT and AR/VR are beginning to make deep inroads into how complex products are engi-neered and assembled. These categories of technologies are becoming prominent in manufacturing because they offer potential solutions to the problems of unskilled labor and workforce shortages. Technology has the potential to shift manufacturing in both large and small ways, to better un-derstand how a manufacturing organization might appropri-ate VR, we ran a study with a global aviation manufacturer headquartered the United States. To document the changing nature of work via this class of technologies we conducted a VR study which facilitated access to participant observation and interviews (n=21). Our findings provide initial insights into the organizational impact of VR on human perfor-mance augmentation and skill acquisition revealing the larger infrastructural challenges facing the adoption of con-sumer grade smart technologies in industrial workplace settings.","

Augmented Reality to Enable Users in Learning Case Grammar from Their Real-World Interactions,"Augmented Reality (AR) provides a unique opportunity to situate learning content in one's environment. In this work, we investigated how AR could be developed to provide an interactive context-based language learning experience. Specifically, we developed a novel handheld-AR app for learning case grammar by dynamically creating quizzes, based on real-life objects in the learner's surroundings. We compared this to the experience of learning with a non-contextual app that presented the same quizzes with static photographic images. Participants found AR suitable for use in their everyday lives and enjoyed the interactive experience of exploring grammatical relationships in their surroundings. Nonetheless, Bayesian tests provide substantial evidence that the interactive and context-embedded AR app did not improve case grammar skills, vocabulary retention, and usability over the experience with equivalent static images. Based on this, we propose how language learning apps could be designed to combine the benefits of contextual AR and traditional approaches.","
Augmented Reality technology may not be effective in improving learning outcomes, despite its interactive and immersive nature, and may not be worth the investment of time and resources.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376537,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,economy
CollabAR  Investigating the Mediating Role of Mobile AR Interfaces on Co-Located Group Collaboration,"Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) technology is enabling new applications for different domains including architecture, education or medical work. As AR interfaces project digital data, information and models into the real world, it allows for new forms of collaborative work. However, despite the wide availability of AR applications, very little is known about how AR interfaces mediate and shape collaborative practices. This paper presents a study which examines how a mobile AR (M-AR) interface for inspecting and discovering AR models of varying complexity impacts co-located group practices. We contribute new insights into how current mobile AR interfaces impact co-located collaboration. Our results show that M-AR interfaces induce high mental load and frustration, cause a high number of context switches between devices and group discussion, and overall leads to a reduction in group interaction. We present design recommendations for future work focusing on collaborative AR interfaces.","Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces can negatively impact co-located group practices by inducing high mental load and frustration, causing a high number of context switches between devices and group discussion, and overall leading to a reduction in group interaction.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376541,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Political Hashtags & the Lost Art of Democratic Discourse,"In this work, we investigate whether and how the presence of political hashtags in social media news articles influences the way people discuss news content. Specifically, we examine how political hashtags in news posts act as a design characteristic that affects the quality of online discourse. We use a randomized control experiment to assess how the presence versus absence of political hashtags (particularly the most prevalently used #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter) in social media news posts shapes discourse across a general audience (n=3205). Key findings show differences in topical focus, emotional tone of discourse, and rhetorical styles between commenters who were shown news posts with political hashtags versus those shown news posts without the hashtags. Compared to the control group, those shown hashtagged news posts heavily focus on the politics of the hashtag, use more words associated with fear, anger, and disgust in their comments, and exhibit black-and-white rhetoric and less emotionally temperate expressions in their arguments.","Social media news articles with political hashtags can negatively impact the quality of online discourse, leading to a focus on politics rather than the actual news content, increased use of negative emotions and black-and-white thinking, and less emotionally temperate expressions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376542,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Characterizing Twitter Users Who Engage in Adversarial Interactions against Political Candidates,"Social media provides a critical communication platform for political figures, but also makes them easy targets for harassment. In this paper, we characterize users who adversarially interact with political figures on Twitter using mixed-method techniques. The analysis is based on a dataset of 400 thousand users' 1.2 million replies to 756 candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives in the two months leading up to the 2018 midterm elections. We show that among moderately active users, adversarial activity is associated with decreased centrality in the social graph and increased attention to candidates from the opposing party. When compared to users who are similarly active, highly adversarial users tend to engage in fewer supportive interactions with their own party's candidates and express negativity in their user profiles. Our results can inform the design of platform moderation mechanisms to support political figures countering online harassment.","Social media platforms can make political figures easy targets for harassment, leading to decreased centrality in the social graph and increased attention to opposing parties.

Private Responses for Public Sharing: Understanding Self-Presentation and Relational Maintenance via Stories in Social Media,"With nearly two billion users, social media Stories-an ephemeral format of sharing-are increasingly popular and projected to overtake sharing via public feeds. Sharing via Stories differs from Feeds sharing by removing the visible feedback (e.g. ""likes"" and ""comments"") which has come to characterize social media. Given the salience of responses visibility to self-presentation and relational maintenance in social media literature, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N = 22) to explore how people understand these processes when using Stories. We find that users have lower expectations for responses with Stories and experience lower pressure for self-presentation. This fosters more frequent sharing and a sense of daily connectedness, which strong ties can find valuable. Finally, the act of viewing takes on new significance of signaling attention when made known to the sharer. Our findings point to the importance of effort and attention in understanding responses on social media.","Social media's shift to ephemeral sharing formats like Stories can lead to a decrease in meaningful interactions and self-presentation, as users have lower expectations for responses and feel less pressure to present themselves perfectly. This can result in a false sense of connectedness and shallow relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376549,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
A User Study on Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration with Eye Gaze and Hand Gesture Sharing,"Supporting natural communication cues is critical for people to work together remotely and face-to-face. In this paper we present a Mixed Reality (MR) remote collaboration system that enables a local worker to share a live 3D panorama of his/her surroundings with a remote expert. The remote expert can also share task instructions back to the local worker using visual cues in addition to verbal communication. We conducted a user study to investigate how sharing augmented gaze and gesture cues from the remote expert to the local worker could affect the overall collaboration performance and user experience. We found that by combing gaze and gesture cues, our remote collaboration system could provide a significantly stronger sense of co-presence for both the local and remote users than using the gaze cue alone. The combined cues were also rated significantly higher than the gaze in terms of ease of conveying spatial actions.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology in remote collaboration can lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication and social interaction, potentially isolating individuals and negatively impacting their mental health and well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376550,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Will Deleting History Make Alexa More Trustworthy?: Effects of Privacy and Content Customization on User Experience of Smart Speakers,"""Always-on"" smart speakers have raised privacy and security concerns, to address which vendors have introduced customizable privacy settings. But, does the act of customizing one's privacy preferences have any effects on user experience and trust? To address this question, we developed an app for Amazon Alexa and conducted a user study (N = 90). Our data show that the affordance to customize privacy settings enhances trust and usability for regular users, while it has adverse effects on power users. In addition, only enabling privacy-setting customization without allowing content customization negatively affects trust among users with higher privacy concerns. When they can customize both content and privacy settings, user trust is highest. That is, while privacy customization may cause reactance among power users, allowing privacy-concerned individuals to simultaneously customize content can help to alleviate the resultant negative effect on trust. These findings have implications for designing more privacy-sensitive and trustworthy smart speakers.","Privacy and security concerns with always-on smart speakers. Customizing privacy settings may have adverse effects on power users, and only allowing privacy-setting customization without content customization may negatively affect trust among users with higher privacy concerns.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376551,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Too Hot to Handle: An Evaluation of the Effect of Thermal Visual Representation on User Grasping Interaction in Virtual Reality,"Influence of interaction fidelity and rendering quality on perceived user experience have been largely explored in Virtual Reality (VR). However, differences in interaction choices triggered by these rendering cues have not yet been explored. We present a study analysing the effect of thermal visual cues and contextual information on 50 participants' approach to grasp and move a virtual mug. This study comprises 3 different temperature cues (baseline empty, hot and cold) and 4 contextual representations; all embedded in a VR scenario. We evaluate 2 different hand representations (abstract and human) to assess grasp metrics. Results show temperature cues influenced grasp location, with the mug handle being predominantly grasped with a smaller grasp aperture for the hot condition, while the body and top were preferred for baseline and cold conditions.","

Users may be influenced by visual cues in Virtual Reality to make decisions that are not in their best interest. For example, in a study, participants were more likely to grasp a virtual mug by the handle when it was depicted as hot, which could lead to burns in real life. This highlights the need for responsible design of Virtual Reality experiences to avoid harmful consequences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376554,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Evaluation of a Financial Portfolio Visualization using Computer Displays and Mixed Reality Devices with Domain Experts,"With the advent of mixed reality devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens, developers have been faced with the challenge to utilize the third dimension in information visualization effectively. Research on stereoscopic devices has shown that three-dimensional representation can improve accuracy in specific tasks (e.g., network visualization). Yet, so far the field has remained mute on the underlying mechanism. Our study systematically investigates the differences in user perception between a regular monitor and a mixed reality device. In a real-life within-subject experiment in the field with twenty-eight investment bankers, we assessed subjective and objective task performance with two- and three-dimensional systems, respectively. We tested accuracy with regard to position, size, and color using single and combined tasks. Our results do not show a significant difference in accuracy between mixed-reality and standard 2D monitor visualizations.","

The study found that there was no significant difference in accuracy between mixed-reality and standard 2D monitor visualizations, suggesting that the additional dimension provided by mixed reality technology may not necessarily improve performance or accuracy in certain tasks.

Virtually-Extended Proprioception: Providing Spatial Reference in VR through an Appended Virtual Limb,"Selecting targets directly in the virtual world is difficult due to the lack of haptic feedback and inaccurate estimation of egocentric distances. Proprioception, the sense of self-movement and body position, can be utilized to improve virtual target selection by placing targets on or around one's body. However, its effective scope is limited closely around one's body. We explore the concept of virtually-extended proprioception by appending virtual body parts mimicking real body parts to users' avatars, to provide spatial reference to virtual targets. Our studies suggest that our approach facilitates more efficient target selection in VR as compared to no reference or using an everyday object as reference. Besides, by cultivating users' sense of ownership on the appended virtual body part, we can further enhance target selection performance. The effects of transparency and granularity of the virtual body part on target selection performance are also discussed.","

The use of virtual body parts to improve target selection in virtual reality can lead to a decrease in the user's sense of ownership and control over their own body. This can result in a loss of proprioception, making it more difficult for the user to navigate and interact with the virtual environment. Additionally, the use of virtual body parts can create a sense of disembodiment, where the user feels disconnected from their physical body, leading to feelings of disorientation and confusion.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376557,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Alexa as Coach: Leveraging Smart Speakers to Build Social Agents that Reduce Public Speaking Anxiety,"Public speaking anxiety is one of the most common social phobias. We explore the feasibility of using a conversational agent to reduce this anxiety. We developed a public-speaking tutor on the Amazon Alexa platform that enables users to engage in cognitive reconstruction exercises. We also investigated how the sociability of the agent might affect its performance as a tutor. A user study of 53 college students with fear of public speaking showed that the interaction with the agent served to assuage pre-speech state anxiety. Agent sociability improved the sense of interpersonal closeness, which was associated with lower pre-speech anxiety. Moreover, sociability of the agent increased participants' satisfaction and their willingness to continue engagement. Our findings, thus, have implications not only for addressing public speaking anxiety in a scalable way but also for the design of future conversational agents using smart speaker platforms.","

The use of conversational agents, such as Amazon Alexa, to reduce public speaking anxiety may lead to a decrease in interpersonal skills and an increase in reliance on technology for social interactions.

Do You Feel Like Passing Through Walls?: Effect of Self-Avatar Appearance on Facilitating Realistic Behavior in Virtual Environments,"Preventing users from walking through virtual boundaries (e.g., walls) is an important issue to be addressed in room-scale virtual environments (VEs), considering the safety and design limitations. Sensory feedback from wall collisions has been shown to be effective; however, it can disrupt the immersion. We assumed that a greater sense of presence would discourage users from walking through walls and conducted a two-factor between-subjects experiment (N = 92) that controls the anthropomorphism (realistic or abstract) and visibility (full-body or hand-only) of self-avatars. We analyzed the participants' behaviors and the moment they first penetrated the wall in game-like VEs that gradually instigated participants to penetrate the walls. The results showed that the realistic full-body self-avatar was the most effective for discouraging the participants from penetrating the walls. Furthermore, the participants with lower presence tended to walk through the walls sooner. This study can contribute to applications that require realistic user responses in VEs.","Users may become so immersed in virtual environments that they forget about real-world boundaries and safety limitations, leading to potential accidents or injuries.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376562,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Augmented Reality for Older Adults: Exploring Acceptability of Virtual Coaches for Home-based Balance Training in an Aging Population,"Balance training has been shown to be effective in reducing risks of falling, which is a major concern for older adults. Usually, exercise programs are individually prescribed and monitored by physiotherapeutic or medical experts. Unfortunately, supervision and motivation of older adults during home-based exercises cannot be provided on a large scale, in particular, considering an ageing population. Augmented reality (AR) in combination with virtual coaches could provide a reasonable solution to this challenge. We present a first investigation of the acceptance of an AR coaching system for balance training, which can be performed at home. In a human-centered design approach we developed several mock-ups and prototypes, and evaluated them with 76 older adults. The results suggest that older adults find the system encouraging and stimulating. The virtual coach is perceived as an alive, calm, intelligent, and friendly human. However, usability of the entire AR system showed a significant negative correlation with participants' age.","

"""Nobody Speaks that Fast!"" An Empirical Study of Speech Rate in Conversational Agents for People with Vision Impairments","The number of people with vision impairments using Conversational Agents (CAs) has increased because of the potential of this technology to support them. As many visually impaired people are accustomed to understanding fast speech, most screen readers or voice assistant systems offer speech rate settings. However, current CAs are designed to interact at a human-like speech rate without considering their accessibility. In this study, we tried to understand how people with vision impairments use CA at a fast speech rate. We conducted a 20-day in-home study that examined the CA use of 10 visually impaired people at default and fast speech rates. We investigated the difference in visually impaired people's CA use with different speech rates and their perception toward CA at each rate. Based on these findings, we suggest considerations for the future design of CA speech rate for those with visual impairments.","
The current design of Voice Assistants, which interact at a human-like speech rate, can be inaccessible for people with vision impairments who are accustomed to understanding fast speech.

"Others' Images: Online Social Media, Architectural Improvisations, and Spatial Marginalization in Bangladesh","This paper joins the growing body of work in postcolonial computing in HCI, and critically examines the impacts of online social media on the urban architecture in the Global South. Based on our nine-month long ethnography at eight residential areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh, this paper reports how online fame drives local users to produce digital images of their houses mimicking various Western standards, which in turn, brings changes to the organization, aesthetics, and functions of domestic spaces. This paper also describes how such digital image mediated transformations to local architecture are diminishing traditional spaces, altering their usual functions, and limiting the movement of many women inside their home. Drawing from a rich body of literature in postcolonialism, critical image theory, architecture, and Islamic feminism, we explain how these practices demonstrate a subaltern experience of using social media in the Global South. We further discuss design implications to both HCI and architecture to address these issues, and connect our findings to the broader agendas of HCI around social justice and global development.","Social media is driving people in the Global South to change their homes to conform to Western standards, leading to the loss of traditional spaces and limiting women's movement.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376572,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Walking by Cycling: A Novel In-Place Locomotion User Interface for Seated Virtual Reality Experiences,"We introduce VR Strider, a novel locomotion user interface (LUI) for seated virtual reality (VR) experiences, which maps cycling biomechanics of the user's legs to virtual walking movements. The core idea is to translate the motion of pedaling on a mini exercise bike to a corresponding walking animation of a virtual avatar while providing audio-based tactile feedback on virtual ground contacts. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the LUI and our novel anchor-turning rotation control method regarding task performance, spatial cognition, VR sickness, sense of presence, usability and comfort in a path-integration task. The results show that VR Strider has a significant positive effect on the participants' angular and distance estimation, sense of presence and feeling of comfort compared to other established locomotion techniques, such as teleportation and joystick-based navigation. A confirmatory study further indicates the necessity of synchronized avatar animations for virtual vehicles that rely on pedalling.","VR Strider may cause users to become disoriented and lose their sense of spatial awareness, leading to poor performance in tasks that require accurate distance and angle estimation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376574,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Leveraging Error Correction in Voice-based Text Entry by Talk-and-Gaze,"We present the design and evaluation of Talk-and-Gaze (TaG), a method for selecting and correcting errors with voice and gaze. TaG uses eye gaze to overcome the inability of voice-only systems to provide spatial information. The user's point of gaze is used to select an erroneous word either by dwelling on the word for 800 ms (D-TaG) or by uttering a ""select"" voice command (V-TaG). A user study with 12 participants compared D-TaG, V-TaG, and a voice-only method for selecting and correcting words. Corrections were performed more than 20% faster with D-TaG compared to the V-TaG or voice-only methods. As well, D-TaG was observed to require 24% less selection effort than V-TaG and 11% less selection effort than voice-only error correction. D-TaG was well received in a subjective assessment with 66% of users choosing it as their preferred choice for error correction in voice-based text entry.","

The use of voice-based text entry systems can lead to errors in the text being entered, which can be difficult to correct using voice commands alone.

Reflexive VR Storytelling Design Beyond Immersion: Facilitating Self-Reflection on Death and Loneliness,"This research examines the reflexive dimensions of cinematic virtual reality (CVR) storytelling. We created Anonymous, an interactive CVR piece that employs a reflexive storytelling method. This method is based on distancing effects and is used to elicit audience awareness and self-reflection about loneliness and death. To understand the audience's experiences, we conducted in-depth interviews to study which design factors and elements prompted reflexive thoughts and feelings. Our findings highlight how the audience experience was impacted by four reflexive dimensions: abstract and minimal aesthetics, everyday materials and textures, the restriction of control, and multiple, disembodied points of view. We use our findings to discuss how these dimensions can inform the design of VR storytelling experiences that provoke self and social reflection.","

The use of virtual reality technology can lead to a lack of self-awareness and reflection, as users become immersed in a virtual world and disconnected from reality. This can result in a decrease in empathy and a loss of touch with the physical world, leading to negative consequences such as loneliness and isolation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376582,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"Awareness, Navigation, and Use of Feed Control Settings Online","Control settings are abundant and have significant effects on user experiences. One example of an impactful but understudied area is feed settings. In this study, we investigated awareness, navigation, and use of feed settings. We began by creating a taxonomy of feed settings on social media and search sites. Via an online survey, we measured awareness of Facebook feed settings. An in-person interview study then investigated how people navigated to and chose to set feed settings on their own feeds. We discovered that many participants did not believe ad personalization feed settings existed. Furthermore, we discovered a misalignment in the expectation and the function of settings, especially of ad personalization settings for many participants. Despite all participants struggling to find at least one setting, participants overall wanted to use settings: 94% altered at least one setting they encountered. From these results, we discuss implications and suggest design guidelines for settings.","Many users are not aware of the feed settings available on social media platforms, including ad personalization settings, and there is a misalignment between users' expectations and the actual function of these settings.

Understanding Viewport- and World-based Pointing with Everyday Smart Devices in Immersive Augmented Reality,"Personal smart devices have demonstrated a variety of efficient techniques for pointing and selecting on physical displays. However, when migrating these input techniques to augmented reality, it is both unclear what the relative performance of different techniques will be given the immersive nature of the environment, and it is unclear how viewport-based versus world-based pointing methods will impact performance. To better understand the impact of device and viewing perspectives on pointing in augmented reality, we present the results of two controlled experiments comparing pointing conditions that leverage various smartphone- and smartwatch-based external display pointing techniques and examine viewport-based versus world-based target acquisition paradigms. Our results demonstrate that viewport-based techniques offer faster selection and that both smartwatch- and smartphone-based pointing techniques represent high-performance options for performing distant target acquisition tasks in augmented reality.","

The article highlights the potential for viewport-based techniques to offer faster selection in augmented reality environments. However, this could lead to users becoming too reliant on technology and neglecting their natural surroundings, leading to a decrease in situational awareness and potentially harmful consequences. Additionally, the use of viewport-based techniques may also contribute to the development of ""screen addiction,"" where individuals become so focused on the virtual world that they neglect their real-life responsibilities and relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376592,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"""You Don't Have To Know My Past"": How WeChat Moments Users Manage Their Evolving Self-Presentation","Most social media platforms record, display, and archive users' personal histories. This persistence of posts over time can be problematic, as users' self-presentation goals and network composition change, but old content remains. In this paper, we explore an alternative feature that provides control over content persistence. We present findings from interviews with 16 users of the popular Chinese social media platform WeChat Moments. We focused on Moments' Time Limit setting, which makes social media data ephemeral to audiences, but persistent to posters. Interviewees described changes in their self-presentation goals and social network composition over time and reported the Time Limit feature helped them effortlessly manage their desired self-presentation as they matured. Drawing on these findings, we discuss design implications for social media to facilitate greater control over content visibility and persistence, which may have significant benefits for social media users with large and diverse networks.","Social media platforms keep a permanent record of users' personal information, posts, and interactions, which can be problematic as users' goals and network composition change over time.

Affect Recognition using Psychophysiological Correlates in High Intensity VR Exergaming,"User experience estimation of VR exergame players by recognising their affective state could enable us to personalise and optimise their experience. Affect recognition based on psychophysiological measurements has been successful for moderate intensity activities. High intensity VR exergames pose challenges as the effects of exercise and VR headsets interfere with those measurements. We present two experiments that investigate the use of different sensors for affect recognition in a VR exergame. The first experiment compares the impact of physical exertion and gamification on psychophysiological measurements during rest, conventional exercise, VR exergaming, and sedentary VR gaming. The second experiment compares underwhelming, overwhelming and optimal VR exergaming scenarios. We identify gaze fixations, eye blinks, pupil diameter and skin conductivity as psychophysiological measures suitable for affect recognition in VR exergaming and analyse their utility in determining affective valence and arousal. Our findings provide guidelines for researchers of affective VR exergames.","

The use of psychophysiological measurements to recognize affective state in VR exergaming can be challenging due to interference from exercise and VR headsets.

Neo-Noumena: Augmenting Emotion Communication,"The subjective experience of emotion is notoriously difficult to interpersonally communicate. We believe that technology can challenge this notion through the design of neuroresponsive systems for interpersonal communication. We explore this through ""Neo-Noumena"", a communicative neuroresponsive system that uses brain-computer interfacing and artificial intelligence to read one's emotional states and dynamically represent them to others in mixed reality through two head-mounted displays. In our study five participant pairs were given Neo-Noumena for three days, using the system freely. Measures of emotional competence demonstrated a statistically significant increase in participants' ability to interpersonally regulate emotions. Furthermore, participant interviews revealed themes regarding Spatiotemporal Actualization, Objective Representation, and Preternatural Transmission. We also suggest design strategies for future augmented emotion communication systems.

Closer Object Looks Smaller: Investigating the Duality of Size Perception in a Spherical Fish Tank VR Display,"Fish Tank Virtual Reality (FTVR) displays provide compelling 3D experiences by rendering view-dependent imagery on a 2D screen. While users perceive a 3D object in space, they are actually looking at pixels on a 2D screen, thus, a perceptual duality exists between the object's pixels and the 3D percept potentially interfering with the experience. To investigate, we conducted an experiment to see whether the on-screen size of the 2D imagery affects the perceived object size in 3D space with different viewing conditions, including stereopsis. We found that the size of on-screen imagery significantly influenced object size perception, causing 83.3% under/overestimation of perceived size when viewing without stereopsis and reducing to 64.7% with stereopsis. Contrary to reality, objects look smaller when the viewer gets closer. Understanding the perceptual duality helps us to provide accurate perception of real-world objects depicted in the virtual environment and pave the way for 3D applications.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can create a perceptual duality between the 2D screen and the 3D percept, potentially interfering with the user's perception of size and distance, causing them to under or overestimate the size of objects in the virtual environment.

Who Put That There? Temporal Navigation of Spatial Recordings by Direct Manipulation,"Spatial recordings allow viewers to move within them and freely choose their viewpoint. However, such recordings make it easy to miss events and difficult to follow moving objects when skipping through the recording. To alleviate these problems we present the Who Put That There system that allows users to navigate through time by directly manipulating objects in the scene. By selecting an object, the user can navigate to moments where the object changed. Users can also view trajectories of objects that changed location and directly manipulate them to navigate. We evaluated the system with a set of sensemaking questions in a think-aloud study. Participants understood the system and found it useful for finding events of interest, while being present and engaged in the recording.","

The system can be used to manipulate people's perception of reality by altering the objects in the scene, leading to confusion and misinterpretation of events.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376604,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
"""How do I make this thing smile?"": An Inventory of Expressive Nonverbal Communication in Commercial Social Virtual Reality Platforms","Despite the proliferation of platforms for social Virtual Reality (VR) communicating emotional expression via an avatar remains a significant design challenge. In order to better understand the design space for expressive Nonverbal Communication (NVC) in social VR we undertook an inventory of the ten most prominent social VR platforms. Our inventory identifies the dominant design strategies for movement, facial control, and gesture in commercial VR applications, and identifies opportunities and challenges for future design and research into social expression in VR. Specifically, we highlight the paucity of interaction paradigms for facial expression and the near nonexistence of meaningful control over ambient aspects of nonverbal communication such as posture, pose, and social status.","Limited ability to express emotions and nonverbal cues in virtual reality, leading to a lack of meaningful communication and social interaction.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376606,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Scenario Co-Creation Cards: A Culturally Sensitive Tool for Eliciting Values,"Values are an integral part of human identity and have a pervasive impact upon human behavior. This makes understanding them a central concern in the design of technology, as exemplified by approaches such as Value Sensitive Design (""VSD""). Identifying and concreting the values held by a given population can be a difficult endeavor, especially where there is a cultural barrier limiting an effective discussion of them, for example in societies where freedom of expression is discouraged. Addressing this concern requires an in-depth consideration of appropriate value elicitation methods, which responds to the fact that it is not possible to understand values detached from their cultural context. We introduce a novel implicit method, Scenario Co-Creation Cards, and show how it can be used to incorporate existing models of culture in the value elicitation process. We demonstrate this in a case study of Saudi women's visibility in the digital media.","

The Government's Dividend: Complex Perceptions of Social Media Misinformation in China,"The social media environment in China has become the dominant source of information and news over the past decade. This news environment has naturally suffered from challenges related to mis- and dis-information, encumbered by an increasingly complex landscape of factors and players including social media services, fact-checkers, censorship policies, and astroturfing. Interviews with 44 Chinese WeChat users were conducted to understand how individuals perceive misinformation and how it impacts their news consumption practices. Overall, this work exposes the diverse attitudes and coping strategies that Chinese users employ in complex social media environments. Due to the complex nature of censorship in China and participants' lack of understanding of censor-ship, they expressed varied opinions about its influence on the credibility of online information sources. Further, although most participants claimed that their opinions would not be easily swayed by astroturfers, many admitted that they could not effectively distinguish astroturfers from ordinary Internet users. Participants' inability to make sense of comments found online lead many participants to hold pro-censorship attitudes: the Government's Dividend.","Social media users in China struggle with identifying misinformation and have varying opinions on the credibility of online sources due to censorship and astroturfing, leading some to support government censorship.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376612,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
"Embodied Axes: Tangible, Actuated Interaction for 3D Augmented Reality Data Spaces","We present Embodied Axes, a controller which supports selection operations for 3D imagery and data visualisations in Augmented Reality. The device is an embodied representation of a 3D data space -- each of its three orthogonal arms corresponds to a data axis or domain specific frame of reference. Each axis is composed of a pair of tangible, actuated range sliders for precise data selection, and rotary encoding knobs for additional parameter tuning or menu navigation. The motor actuated sliders support alignment to positions of significant values within the data, or coordination with other input: e.g., mid-air gestures in the data space, touch gestures on the surface below the data, or another Embodied Axes device supporting multi-user scenarios. We conducted expert enquiries in medical imaging which provided formative feedback on domain tasks and refinements to the design. Additionally, a controlled user study was performed and found that the Embodied Axes was overall more accurate than conventional tracked controllers for selection tasks.","

The use of Augmented Reality technology in medical imaging may lead to a decrease in the accuracy of selection tasks, as users may rely too heavily on the technology and neglect their own spatial awareness and fine motor skills. Additionally, the use of motor-actuated sliders and rotary encoding knobs may lead to user fatigue and discomfort, potentially affecting the overall performance of the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376613,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
ARchitect: Building Interactive Virtual Experiences from Physical Affordances by Bringing Human-in-the-Loop,"Automatic generation of Virtual Reality (VR) worlds which adapt to physical environments have been proposed to enable safe walking in VR. However, such techniques mainly focus on the avoidance of physical objects as obstacles and overlook their interaction affordances as passive haptics. Current VR experiences involving interaction with physical objects in surroundings still require verbal instruction from an assisting partner. We present ARchitect, a proof-of-concept prototype that allows flexible customization of a VR experience with human-in-the-loop. ARchitect brings in an assistant to map physical objects to virtual proxies of matching affordances using Augmented Reality (AR). In a within-subjects study (9 user pairs) comparing ARchitect to a baseline condition, assistants and players experienced decreased workload and players showed increased VR presence and trust in the assistant. Finally, we defined design guidelines of ARchitect for future designers and implemented three demonstrative experiences.",Users may become too reliant on virtual assistants and lose their ability to navigate physical spaces independently.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376614,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
TandemTrack: Shaping Consistent Exercise Experience by Complementing a Mobile App with a Smart Speaker,"Smart speakers such as Amazon Echo present promising opportunities for exploring voice interaction in the domain of in-home exercise tracking. In this work, we examine if and how voice interaction complements and augments a mobile app in promoting consistent exercise. We designed and developed TandemTrack, which combines a mobile app and an Alexa skill to support exercise regimen, data capture, feedback, and reminder. We then conducted a four-week between-subjects study deploying TandemTrack to 22 participants who were instructed to follow a short daily exercise regimen: one group used only the mobile app and the other group used both the app and the skill. We collected rich data on individuals' exercise adherence and performance, and their use of voice and visual interactions, while examining how TandemTrack as a whole influenced their exercise experience. Reflecting on these data, we discuss the benefits and challenges of incorporating voice interaction to assist daily exercise, and implications for designing effective multimodal systems to support self-tracking and promote consistent exercise.","

The integration of voice assistants in exercise tracking can lead to a lack of user engagement and motivation. The study found that participants who used both the mobile app and the Alexa skill had lower exercise adherence and performance compared to those who only used the mobile app. This suggests that relying solely on voice interaction can lead to a less engaging and less effective exercise experience. Additionally, the study highlights the challenges of incorporating voice interaction in multimodal systems, which can have implications for designing effective systems to support self-tracking and promote consistent exercise.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376616,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Body-Penetrating Tactile Phantom Sensations,"In tactile interaction, a phantom sensation refers to an illusion felt on the skin between two distant points at which vibrations are applied. It can improve the perceptual spatial resolution of tactile stimulation with a few tactors. All phantom sensations reported in the literature act on the skin or out of the body, but no such reports exist for those eliciting sensations penetrating the body. This paper addresses tactile phantom sensations in which two vibration actuators on the dorsal and palmar sides of the hand present an illusion of vibration passing through the hand. We also demonstrate similar tactile illusions for the torso. For optimal design, we conducted user studies while varying vibration frequency, envelope function, stimulus duration, and penetrating direction. Based on the results, we present design guidelines on penetrating phantom sensations for its use in immersive virtual reality applications.","Users may experience illusory sensations that can be uncomfortable or disorienting, such as feeling vibrations passing through their body, which can negatively impact their immersive experience in virtual reality applications.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376619,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Podoportation: Foot-Based Locomotion in Virtual Reality,"Virtual Reality (VR) allows for infinitely large environments. However, the physical traversable space is always limited by real-world boundaries. This discrepancy between physical and virtual dimensions renders traditional locomotion methods used in real world unfeasible. To alleviate these limitations, research proposed various artificial locomotion concepts such as teleportation, treadmills, and redirected walking. However, these concepts occupy the user's hands, require complex hardware or large physical spaces. In this paper, we contribute nine VR locomotion concepts for foot-based locomotion, relying on the 3D position of the user's feet and the pressure applied to the sole as input modalities. We evaluate our concepts and compare them to state-of-the-art point & teleport technique in a controlled experiment with 20 participants. The results confirm the viability of our approaches for foot-based and engaging locomotion. Further, based on the findings, we contribute a wireless hardware prototype implementation.","

The use of virtual reality technology can lead to a disconnect between the physical and virtual dimensions, resulting in a lack of awareness of real-world boundaries and limitations. This can lead to a reliance on artificial locomotion methods, which can be restrictive and require complex hardware or large physical spaces. Additionally, these methods can occupy the user's hands and limit their ability to interact with the physical world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376626,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Conversational Technologies for In-home Learning: Using Co-Design to Understand Children's and Parents' Perspectives,"Today, Conversational Agents (CA) are deeply integrated into the daily lives of millions of families, which has led children to extensively interact with such devices. Studies have suggested that the social nature of CA makes them a good learning companion for children. Therefore, to understand children's preferences for the use of CAs for the purpose of in-home learning, we conducted three participatory design sessions. In order to identify parents' requirements in this regard, we also included them in the third session. We found that children expect such devices to possess a personality and an advanced level of intelligence, and support multiple content domains and learning modes and human-like conversations. Parents desire such devices to include them in their children's learning activities, foster social engagement, and to allow them to monitor their children's use. This understanding will inform the design of future CAs for the purpose of in-home learning.","Children may prefer conversational agents (CAs) with personalities and advanced intelligence, but this could lead to a decrease in human-to-human interactions and social skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376631,Voice Assistant,CHI,social norms & relationship
Be Water: Technologies in the Leaderless Anti-ELAB Movement in Hong Kong,"We examine a leaderless social movement characterized by participants' autonomy and the absence of leaders and organizations. We conducted a participant observation study of the Anti-ELAB movement in Hong Kong. Focusing on the organization of a protest march, we collected thousands of lines of discourse in the LIHKG Forum and the Telegram instant messaging system. Our grounded theory analysis revealed hundreds of groups acting within a symbiotic network. Participants promoted an ethos of empowering individual participants and groups to act autonomously. At the same time, participants' extensive use of hyperlinks and polls orchestrated a coherent social movement. We discuss how this novel formation can mediate successful leaderless movements.","Social Media can create leaderless movements that are decentralized and lack a clear structure, making it difficult to negotiate or address grievances with a unified voice.

XRDirector: A Role-Based Collaborative Immersive Authoring System,"Immersive authoring is an increasingly popular technique to design AR/VR scenes because design and testing can be done concurrently. Most existing systems, however, are single-user and limited to either AR or VR, thus constrained in the interaction techniques. We present XRDirector, a role-based collaborative immersive authoring system that enables designers to freely express interactions using AR and VR devices as puppets to manipulate virtual objects in 3D physical space. In XRDirector, we adapt roles known from filmmaking to structure the authoring process and help coordinate multiple designers in immersive authoring tasks. We study how novice AR/VR creators can take advantage of the roles and modes in XRDirector to prototype complex scenes with animated 3D characters, light effects, and camera movements, and also simulate interactive system behavior in a Wizard of Oz style. XRDirector's design was informed by case studies around complex 3D movie scenes and AR/VR games, as well as workshops with novice AR/VR creators. We show that XRDirector makes it easier and faster to create AR/VR scenes without the need for coding, characterize the issues in coordinating designers between AR and VR, and identify the strengths and weaknesses of each role and mode to mitigate the issues.","

The use of immersive authoring systems like XRDirector could lead to a decrease in the quality of AR/VR experiences due to the lack of coding knowledge and technical expertise among designers. This could result in poorly designed and buggy AR/VR scenes that may cause user discomfort, eye strain, or even motion sickness. Additionally, the reliance on pre-defined roles and modes may limit the creativity and originality of AR/VR experiences, leading to a homogenization of content.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376637,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Performance and Experience of Throwing in Virtual Reality,"Throwing is a fundamental movement in many sports and games. Given this, accurate throwing in VR applications today is surprisingly difficult. In this paper we explore the nature of the difficulties of throwing in VR in more detail.

In a short pre-study with 3 participants we determine an optimal number of throwing repetitions for the main study by exploring the learning curve and subjective fatigue of throwing in VR. In the main study, with 12 participants, we find that throwing precision and accuracy in VR are lower particularly in the distance and height dimensions.

"Again, Together: Socially Reliving Virtual Reality Experiences When Separated","To share a virtual reality (VR) experience remotely together, users usually record videos from an individual's point of view and then co-watch these videos. However, co-watching recorded videos limits users to reliving their memories from the perspective from which the video was captured. In this paper, we describe ReliveInVR, a new time-machine-like VR experience sharing method. ReliveInVR allows multiple users to immerse themselves in the relived experience together and independently view the experience from any perspective. We conducted a 1x3 within-subject study with 26 dyads to compare ReliveInVR with (1) co-watching 360-degree videos on desktop, and (2) co-watching 360-degree videos in VR. Our results suggest that participants reported higher levels of immersion and social presence in ReliveInVR. Participants in ReliveInVR also understood the shared experience better, discovered unnoticed things together and found the sharing experience more fulfilling. We discuss the design implications for sharing VR experiences over time and space.","

The new time-machine-like VR experience sharing method, ReliveInVR, allows multiple users to immerse themselves in a relived experience together, but it could also lead to a false sense of reliving memories. Users may become too dependent on technology to relive and re-experience memories, rather than letting them fade away naturally.

"Fragile Masculinity: Men, Gender, and Online Harassment","Harassment is a persistent problem in contemporary online environments, with women disproportionately experiencing its most severe forms. While critical scholars posit that online gender harassment may be linked to men's anxieties about fulfilling normative masculine gender roles, this relationship has not been examined by empirical research. We survey 264 young men between the ages of 18-24 about their masculinity anxieties and their perceptions of harassment directed at a woman on Twitter. We find that men who perceive themselves as less masculine than average men report higher endorsement of harassment. Further, we find that the relationship between masculinity anxieties and harassment endorsement is mediated by men's adherence to masculine norms and toxic disinhibition. We interpret these results through the lens of social media's specific affordances, and we discuss their implications for technology designers and other practitioners who wish to better detect, prevent, and remediate online harassment by accounting for the role of gender.","Online harassment, particularly towards women, is a persistent problem in online environments.

"Crafting, Communality, and Computing: Building on Existing Strengths To Support a Vulnerable Population","In Nepal, sex-trafficking survivors and the organizations that support them have limited resources to assist the survivors in their on-going journey towards reintegration. We take an asset-based approach wherein we identify and build on the strengths possessed by such groups. In this work, we present reflections from introducing a voice-annotated web application to a group of survivors. The web application tapped into and built upon two elements of pre-existing strengths possessed by the survivors  the social bond between them and knowledge of crafting as taught to them by the organization. Our findings provide insight into the array of factors influencing how the survivors act in relation to one another as they created novel use practices and adapted the technology. Experience with the application seemed to open knowledge of computing as a potential source of strength. Finally, we articulate three design desiderata that could help promote communal spaces: make activity perceptible to the group, create appropriable steps, and build in fun choices.","

Isness: Using Multi-Person VR to Design Peak Mystical Type Experiences Comparable to Psychedelics,"Studies combining psychotherapy with psychedelic drugs (Ds) have demonstrated positive outcomes that are often associated with 'Ds' ability to induce 'mystical-type' experiences (MTEs) i.e., subjective experiences whose characteristics include a sense of connectedness, transcendence, and ineffability. We suggest that both PsiDs and virtual reality can be situated on a broader spectrum of psychedelic technologies. To test this hypothesis, we used concepts, methods, and analysis strategies from D research to design and evaluate 'Isness', a multi-person VR journey where participants experience the collective emergence, fluctuation, and dissipation of their bodies as energetic essences. A study (N=57) analyzing participant responses to a commonly used D experience questionnaire (MEQ30) indicates that Isness participants reported MTEs comparable to those reported in double-blind clinical studies after high doses of psilocybin and LSD. Within a supportive setting and conceptual framework, VR phenomenology can create the conditions for MTEs from which participants derive insight and meaning.","

"""In VR, everything is possible!"": Sketching and Simulating Spatially-Aware Interactive Spaces in Virtual Reality","We propose using virtual reality (VR) as a design tool for sketching and simulating spatially-aware interactive spaces. Using VR, designers can quickly experience their envisioned spaces and interactions by simulating technologies such as motion tracking, multiple networked devices, or unusual form factors such as spherical touchscreens or bezel-less display tiles. Design ideas can be rapidly iterated without restrictions by the number, size, or shape and availability of devices or sensors in the lab. To understand the potentials and challenges of designing in VR, we conducted a user study with 12 interaction designers. As their tool, they used a custom-built virtual design environment with finger tracking and physics simulations for natural interactions with virtual devices and objects. Our study identified the designers' experience of space in relation to their own bodies and playful design explorations as key opportunities. Key challenges were the complexities of building a usable yet versatile VR-based ""World Editor"".","

Towards an Understanding of Augmented Reality Extensions for Existing 3D Data Analysis Tools,"We present an observational study with domain experts to understand how augmented reality (AR) extensions to traditional PC-based data analysis tools can help particle physicists to explore and understand 3D data. Our goal is to allow researchers to integrate stereoscopic AR-based visual representations and interaction techniques into their tools, and thus ultimately to increase the adoption of modern immersive analytics techniques in existing data analysis workflows. We use Microsoft's HoloLens as a lightweight and easily maintainable AR headset and replicate existing visualization and interaction capabilities on both the PC and the AR view. We treat the AR headset as a second yet stereoscopic screen, allowing researchers to study their data in a connected multi-view manner. Our results indicate that our collaborating physicists appreciate a hybrid data exploration setup with an interactive AR extension to improve their understanding of particle collision events.","

The use of Augmented Reality technology in data analysis may lead to a reliance on technology and a decrease in human intuition and critical thinking skills.

OScH in the Wild: Dissemination of Open Science Hardware and Implications for HCI,"Open Science Hardware (OScH) refers to open-source alternatives for proprietary scientific equipment. While the OScH movement aims to reduce barriers for scientific experimentation both in and beyond professional labs, disseminating OScH for widespread adoption proves to be challenging in practice. To this end, we examined real-world practices related to the dissemination of OScH through a two-part study. First, we developed an open science hardware, a DIY incubator, and disseminated it through the Instructables website and maker workshops. In parallel, we interviewed eight open science hardware practitioners from different parts of the world. Insights from interviews together with our own self-reflections revealed how different OScH dissemination modalities serve unique purposes. Our findings also reveal several challenges for widespread adoption of OScH and the importance of collaborations between OScH developers.

Me vs. Super(wo)man: Effects of Customization and Identification in a VR Exergame,"Customised avatars are a powerful tool to increase identification, engagement and intrinsic motivation in digital games. We investigated the effects of customisation in a self-competitive VR exergame by modelling players and their previous performance in the game with customised avatars. In a first study we found that, similar to non-exertion games, customisation significantly increased identification and intrinsic motivation, as well as physical performance in the exergame. In a second study we identified a more complex relationship with the customisation style: idealised avatars increased wishful identification but decreased exergame performance compared to realistic avatars. In a third study, we found that 'enhancing' realistic avatars with idealised characteristics increased wishful identification, but did not have any adverse effects. We discuss the findings based on feedforward and self-determination theory, proposing notions of intrinsic identification (fostering a sense of self) and extrinsic identification (drawing away from the self) to explain the results.","

Customized avatars in virtual reality games can lead to a decrease in physical performance and a negative impact on self-perception.

Genie in the Bottle: Anthropomorphized Perceptions of Conversational Agents,"This paper presents a qualitative multi-phase study seeking to identify patterns in users' anthropomorphized perceptions of conversational agents. Through a comparative analysis of behavioral perceptions and visual conceptions of three agents - Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri - we first show that the perceptions of an agent's character are structured according to five categories: approachability, sentiment toward a user, professionalism, intelligence, and individuality. We then explore visualizations of the agents' appearance and discuss the specifics assigned to each agent. Finally, we analyze associative explanations for these perceptions. We demonstrate that the anthropomorphized behavioral and visual perceptions of agents yield structural consistency and discuss how these perceptions are linked with each other and system features.","

As children spend more time interacting with technology, they may become less active and less engaged in physical activities, which can have negative effects on their health and well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376667,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
'I Just Want to Hack Myself to Not Get Distracted': Evaluating Design Interventions for Self-Control on Facebook,"Beyond being the world's largest social network, Facebook is for many also one of its greatest sources of digital distraction. For students, problematic use has been associated with negative effects on academic achievement and general wellbeing. To understand what strategies could help users regain control, we investigated how simple interventions to the Facebook UI affect behaviour and perceived control. We assigned 58 university students to one of three interventions: goal reminders, removed newsfeed, or white background (control). We logged use for 6 weeks, applied interventions in the middle weeks, and administered fortnightly surveys. Both goal reminders and removed newsfeed helped participants stay on task and avoid distraction. However, goal reminders were often annoying, and removing the newsfeed made some fear missing out on information. Our findings point to future interventions such as controls for adjusting types and amount of available information, and flexible blocking which matches individual definitions of 'distraction'.","Social Media can be a source of digital distraction, negatively affecting academic achievement and wellbeing.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376672,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
RestoreVR: Generating Embodied Knowledge and Situated Experience of Dunhuang Mural Conservation via Interactive Virtual Reality,"In Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes, unique Buddhist murals of ancient China are preserved. Unfortunately, the exquisite murals are suffering from degradation. Experts have been trying to enhance public's awareness of mural protection, but there's no efficacious means to attract interest and popularize knowledge yet. In this paper, we propose RestoreVR, an interactive virtual reality (VR) system engaging users to experience Dunhuang mural restoration in a digital tour in the cave. Based on an online survey with the public and in-depth interviews with five Dunhuang experts, we derive a set of design requirements for generating embodied knowledge and situated experience in VR to bridge the gap between highly specialized experts and general audiences. Accordingly, we design RestoreVR and conduct a between-subjects user study to compare our system with traditional methods. The results suggest that RestoreVR significantly improves user experience and awareness of CH protection over existing methods.","

The use of Virtual Reality technology in the restoration and preservation of cultural heritage sites and artifacts can lead to a lack of engagement and appreciation for the actual, physical artifacts and their historical significance. People may become more interested in the digital representation than the real thing, potentially leading to a decrease in the value and importance placed on the physical artifacts. Additionally, the use of VR may also create a false sense of familiarity and understanding of the artifacts, potentially leading to a lack of appreciation for the expertise and knowledge of professionals in the field.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376673,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,access to information & discourse
Assessing 2D and 3D Heatmaps for Comparative Analysis: An Empirical Study,"Heatmaps are a popular visualization technique that encode 2D density distributions using color or brightness. Experimental studies have shown though that both of these visual variables are inaccurate when reading and comparing numeric data values. A potential remedy might be to use 3D heatmaps by introducing height as a third dimension to encode the data. Encoding abstract data in 3D, however, poses many problems, too. To better understand this tradeoff, we conducted an empirical study (N=48) to evaluate the user performance of 2D and 3D heatmaps for comparative analysis tasks. We test our conditions on a conventional 2D screen, but also in a virtual reality environment to allow for real stereoscopic vision. Our main results show that 3D heatmaps are superior in terms of error rate when reading and comparing single data items. However, for overview tasks, the well-established 2D heatmap performs better.",Inaccurate data representation and increased error rate when using 3D heatmaps for comparative analysis tasks.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376675,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"The Human in Emotion Recognition on Social Media: Attitudes, Outcomes, Risks","Emotion recognition algorithms recognize, infer, and harvest emotions using data sources such as social media behavior, streaming service use, voice, facial expressions, and biometrics in ways often opaque to the people providing these data. People's attitudes towards emotion recognition and the harms and outcomes they associate with it are important yet unknown. Focusing on social media, we interviewed 13 adult U.S. social media users to fill this gap. We find that people view emotions as insights to behavior, prone to manipulation, intimate, vulnerable, and complex. Many find emotion recognition invasive and scary, associating it with autonomy and control loss. We identify two categories of emotion recognition's risks: individual and societal. We discuss findings' implications for algorithmic accountability and argue for considering emotion data as sensitive. Using a Science and Technology Studies lens, we advocate that technology users should be considered as a relevant social group in emotion recognition advancements.","Emotion recognition algorithms in social media can invade privacy and manipulate users' emotions, leading to loss of autonomy and control.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376680,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
ThermalWear: Exploring Wearable On-chest Thermal Displays to Augment Voice Messages with Affect,"Voice is a rich modality for conveying emotions, however emotional prosody production can be situationally or medically impaired. Since thermal displays have been shown to evoke emotions, we explore how thermal stimulation can augment perception of neutrally-spoken voice messages with affect. We designed ThermalWear, a wearable on-chest thermal display, then tested in a controlled study (N=12) the effects of fabric, thermal intensity, and direction of change. Thereafter, we synthesized 12 neutrally-spoken voice messages, validated (N=7) them, then tested (N=12) if thermal stimuli can augment their perception with affect. We found warm and cool stimuli (a) can be perceived on the chest, and quickly without fabric (4.7-5s) (b) do not incur discomfort (c) generally increase arousal of voice messages and (d) increase / decrease message valence, respectively. We discuss how thermal displays can augment voice perception, which can enhance voice assistants and support individuals with emotional prosody impairments.","

The use of thermal displays to augment voice perception in voice assistants could potentially lead to a decrease in emotional intelligence and empathy in individuals who rely on these technologies. By relying on technology to interpret and convey emotions, individuals may become less attuned to their own emotions and the emotions of others, leading to a decrease in emotional intelligence and empathy. This could have negative consequences in personal relationships and in society as a whole.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376682,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
An Empirical Comparison of Technologically Mediated Advertising in Under-connected Populations,"Information and Communication Technology interventions have the potential to improve outcomes in health and other development sectors in low-income settings. Large-scale impact, however, remains the central challenge for the HCI4D community as significant and diverse resources are typically required to scale such interventions beyond the pilot stage. In contrast, voice-based entertainment services accessible over simple phones, designed for similarly low-income, low-literate populations manage to scale 'virally' to tens of thousands of users with little to no advertising cost. Our study compares the outcomes of using voice-based entertainment to spread a maternal-health hotline against conventional advertisement channels including paper flyers, posters, radio, TV, social media and robocalls. Through an 11-week deployment in Pakistan where the hotline reached 21,770 users over 32,625 calls, we find that the entertainment service outperformed other channels on all popular user acquisition metrics, with the exception of robocalls, which lead in terms of spread.","
Voice Assistant technology can spread misinformation and propaganda, as seen in the case of the maternal-health hotline in Pakistan, where entertainment services were used to spread awareness but were outperformed by robocalls in terms of reach.

Improving Virtual Reality Ergonomics Through Reach-Bounded Non-Linear Input Amplification,"Input amplification enables easier movement in virtual reality (VR) for users with mobility issues or in confined spaces. However, current techniques either do not focus on maintaining feelings of body ownership, or are not applicable to general VR tasks. We investigate a general purpose non-linear transfer function that keeps the user's reach within reasonable bounds to maintain body ownership. The technique amplifies smaller movements from a user-definable neutral point into the expected larger movements using a configurable Hermite curve. Two experiments evaluate the approach. The first establishes that the technique has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, increasing physical comfort while maintaining task performance and body ownership. The second explores the characteristics of the technique over a wide range of amplification levels. Using the combined results, design and implementation recommendations are provided with potential applications to related VR transfer functions.","Users may lose sense of body ownership in virtual reality, leading to discomfort and decreased performance in tasks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376687,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
An Exploratory Study of Augmented Reality Presence for Tutoring Machine Tasks,"Machine tasks in workshops or factories are often a compound sequence of local, spatial, and body-coordinated human-machine interactions. Prior works have shown the merits of video-based and augmented reality (AR) tutoring systems for local tasks. However, due to the lack of a bodily representation of the tutor, they are not as effective for spatial and body-coordinated interactions. We propose avatars as an additional tutor representation to the existing AR instructions. In order to understand the design space of tutoring presence for machine tasks, we conduct a comparative study with 32 users. We aim to explore the strengths/limitations of the following four tutor options: video, non-avatar-AR, half-body+AR, and full-body+AR. The results show that users prefer the half-body+AR overall, especially for the spatial interactions. They have a preference for the full-body+AR for the body-coordinated interactions and the non-avatar-AR for the local interactions. We further discuss and summarize design recommendations and insights for future machine task tutoring systems.","

The use of avatars in augmented reality tutoring systems may not be effective for all types of tasks, and users may prefer different types of tutor representation depending on the specific task.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376688,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
A Skin-Stroke Display on the Eye-Ring Through Head-Mounted Displays,"We present the Skin-Stroke Display, a system mounted on the lens inside the head-mounted display, which exerts subtle yet recognizable tactile feedback on the eye-ring using a motorized air jet. To inform our design of noticeable air-jet haptic feedback, we conducted a user study to identify absolute detection thresholds. Our results show that the tactile sensation had different sensitivity around the eyes, and we determined a standard intensity (8 mbar) to prevent turbulent airflow blowing into the eyes. In the second study, we asked participants to adjust the intensity around the eye for equal sensation based on standard intensity. Next, we investigated the recognition of point and stroke stimuli with or without inducing cognitive load on eight directions on the eye-ring. Our longStroke stimulus can achieve an accuracy of 82.6% without cognitive load and 80.6% with cognitive load simulated by the Stroop test. Finally, we demonstrate example applications using the skin-stroke display as the off-screen indicator, tactile I/O progress display, and tactile display.","

Acoustic Transparency and the Changing Soundscape of Auditory Mixed Reality,"Auditory headsets capable of actively or passively intermixing both real and virtual sounds are in-part acoustically transparent. This paper explores the consequences of acoustic transparency, both on the perception of virtual audio content, given the presence of a real-world auditory backdrop, and more broadly in facilitating a wearable, personal, private, always-available soundspace. We experimentally compare passive acoustically transparent, and active noise cancelling, orientation-tracked auditory headsets across a range of content types, both indoors and outdoors for validity. Our results show differences in terms of presence, realness and externalization for select content types. Via interviews and a survey, we discuss attitudes toward acoustic transparency (e.g. being perceived as safer), the potential shifts in audio usage that might be precipitated by adoption, and reflect on how such headsets and experiences fit within the area of Mixed Reality.","

It Takes a Village: Integrating an Adaptive Chatbot into an Online Gaming Community,"While the majority of research in chatbot design has focused on creating chatbots that engage with users one-on-one, less work has focused on the design of conversational agents for online communities. In this paper we present results from a three week test of a social chatbot in an established online community. During this study, the chatbot ""grew up"" from ""birth"" through its teenage years, engaging with community members and ""learning"" vocabulary from their conversations. We discuss the design of this chatbot, how users' interactions with it evolved over the course of the study, and how it impacted the community as a whole. We discuss how we addressed challenges in developing a chatbot whose vocabulary could be shaped by users, and conclude with implications for the role of machine learning in social interactions in online communities and potential future directions for design of community-based chatbots.","

The chatbot's ""growing up"" process, where it learned from users' conversations, could potentially lead to the spread of harmful or inappropriate language and behavior within the online community.

Evaluation of Machine Learning Techniques for Hand Pose Estimation on Handheld Device with Proximity Sensor,"Tracking finger movement for natural interaction using hand is commonly studied. For vision-based implementations of finger tracking in virtual reality (VR) application, finger movement is occluded by a handheld device which is necessary for auxiliary input, thus tracking finger movement using cameras is still challenging. Finger tracking controllers using capacitive proximity sensors on the surface are starting to appear. However, research on estimating articulated hand pose from curved capacitance sensing electrodes is still immature. Therefore, we built a prototype with 62 electrodes and recorded training datasets using an optical tracking system. We have introduced 2.5D representation to apply convolutional neural network methods on a capacitive image of the curved surface, and two types of network architectures based on recent achievements in the computer vision field were evaluated with our dataset. We also implemented real-time interactive applications using the prototype and demonstrated the possibility of intuitive interaction using fingers in VR applications.","

Touché: Data-Driven Interactive Sword Fighting in Virtual Reality,"VR games offer new freedom for players to interact naturally using motion. This makes it harder to design games that react to player motions convincingly. We present a framework for VR sword fighting experiences against a virtual character that simplifies the necessary technical work to achieve a convincing simulation. The framework facilitates VR design by abstracting from difficult details on the lower ""physical"" level of interaction, using data-driven models to automate both the identification of user actions and the synthesis of character animations. Designers are able to specify the character's behaviour on a higher ""semantic"" level using parameterised building blocks, which allow for control over the experience while minimising manual development work. We conducted a technical evaluation, a questionnaire study and an interactive user study. Our results suggest that the framework produces more realistic and engaging interactions than simple hand-crafted interaction logic, while supporting a controllable and understandable behaviour design.",Over-reliance on technology and decreased manual work can lead to a loss of creativity and problem-solving skills.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376714,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Augmented Reality Training for Industrial Assembly Work - Are Projection-based AR Assistive Systems an Appropriate Tool for Assembly Training?,"Augmented Reality (AR) systems are on their way to industrial application, e.g. projection-based AR is used to enhance assembly work. Previous studies showed advantages of the systems in permanent-use scenarios, such as faster assembly times. In this paper, we investigate whether such systems are suitable for training purposes. Within an experiment, we observed the training with a projection-based AR system over multiple sessions and compared it with a personal training and a paper manual training. Our study shows that projection-based AR systems offer only small benefits in the training scenario. While a systematic mislearning of content is prevented through immediate feedback, our results show that the AR training does not reach the personal training in terms of speed and recall precision after 24 hours. Furthermore, we show that once an assembly task is properly trained, there are no differences in the long-term recall precision, regardless of the training method.",Projection-based AR systems may not be suitable for training purposes as they offer only small benefits and may not reach personal training in terms of speed and recall precision.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376720,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

In a lab study, 35 participants performed visual programming tasks in four combinations of physical (open or closed office) and virtual environments (beach or virtual office). While participants both preferred and were in flow more in a closed office without VR, in an open office, the VR environments outperformed the no VR condition in all measures of flow, performance, and preference.

VoiceCoach: Interactive Evidence-based Training for Voice Modulation Skills in Public Speaking,"The modulation of voice properties, such as pitch, volume, and speed, is crucial for delivering a successful public speech. However, it is challenging to master different voice modulation skills. Though many guidelines are available, they are often not practical enough to be applied in different public speaking situations, especially for novice speakers. We present VoiceCoach, an interactive evidence-based approach to facilitate the effective training of voice modulation skills. Specifically, we have analyzed the voice modulation skills from 2623 high-quality speeches (i.e., TED Talks) and use them as the benchmark dataset. Given a voice input, VoiceCoach automatically recommends good voice modulation examples from the dataset based on the similarity of both sentence structures and voice modulation skills. Immediate and quantitative visual feedback is provided to guide further improvement. The expert interviews and the user study provide support for the effectiveness and usability of VoiceCoach.","

The over-reliance on technology like VoiceCoach can lead to a decrease in the development of natural communication skills, as people may rely too heavily on technology to guide their speech and not practice enough on their own. This can result in a lack of authenticity and spontaneity in public speaking, as well as a potential loss of connection with the audience. Additionally, the use of technology to modulate voice properties may also lead to a homogenization of speaking styles, as people may feel pressure to conform to a particular standard of speaking rather than embracing their unique voice and style.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376726,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Twitter A11y: A Browser Extension to Make Twitter Images Accessible,"Social media platforms are integral to public and private discourse, but are becoming less accessible to people with vision impairments due to an increase in user-posted images. Some platforms (i.e. Twitter) let users add image descriptions (alternative text), but only 0.1% of images include these. To address this accessibility barrier, we created Twitter A11y, a browser extension to add alternative text on Twitter using six methods. For example, screenshots of text are common, so we detect textual images, and create alternative text using optical character recognition. Twitter A11y also leverages services to automatically generate alternative text or reuse them from across the web. We compare the coverage and quality of Twitter A11y's six alt-text strategies by evaluating the timelines of 50 self-identified blind Twitter users. We find that Twitter A11y increases alt-text coverage from 7.6% to 78.5%, before crowdsourcing descriptions for the remaining images. We estimate that 57.5% of returned descriptions are high-quality. We then report on the experiences of 10 participants with visual impairments using the tool during a week-long deployment.

Novice-AI Music Co-Creation via AI-Steering Tools for Deep Generative Models,"While generative deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their capacity for creating novel musical compositions, less attention has been paid to the challenges and potential of co-creating with these musical AIs, especially for novices. In a needfinding study with a widely used, interactive musical AI, we found that the AI can overwhelm users with the amount of musical content it generates, and frustrate them with its non-deterministic output. To better match co-creation needs, we developed AI-steering tools, consisting of Voice Lanes that restrict content generation to particular voices; Example-Based Sliders to control the similarity of generated content to an existing example; Semantic Sliders to nudge music generation in high-level directions (happy/sad, conventional/surprising); and Multiple Alternatives of generated content to audition and choose from. In a summative study (N=21), we discovered the tools not only increased users' trust, control, comprehension, and sense of collaboration with the AI, but also contributed to a greater sense of self-efficacy and ownership of the composition relative to the AI.",Overwhelming and frustrating users with too much non-deterministic output.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376739,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience

HomeSound: An Iterative Field Deployment of an In-Home Sound Awareness System for Deaf or Hard of Hearing Users,"We introduce HomeSound, an in-home sound awareness system for Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) users. Similar to the Echo Show or Nest Hub, HomeSound consists of a microphone and display, and uses multiple devices installed in each home. We iteratively developed two prototypes, both of which sense and visualize sound information in real-time. Prototype 1 provided a floorplan view of sound occurrences with waveform histories depicting loudness and pitch. A three-week deployment in four DHH homes showed an increase in participants' home- and self-awareness but also uncovered challenges due to lack of line of sight and sound classification. For Prototype 2, we added automatic sound classification and smartwatch support for wearable alerts. A second field deployment in four homes showed further increases in awareness but misclassifications and constant watch vibrations were not well received. We discuss findings related to awareness, privacy, and display placement and implications for future home sound awareness technology.","

The use of voice assistant technology in homes can lead to a lack of privacy for the users, as the devices are constantly listening and collecting data on the users' activities and conversations.

Investigating Roleplaying and Identity Transformation in a Virtual Reality Narrative Experience,"In this paper we describe the design and evaluation of The Next Fairy Tale (TNFT) VR, a theatrical interactive storytelling system created in virtual reality and informed by performing arts theories. TNFT was designed to produce opportunities for interactors to experience role-taking and character identification using design principles drawn from actor training and theatrical performance. We report the results of a pilot qualitative study of interactors using TNFT to explore the elements of the design that supported or hindered roleplaying behavior. We identify four design patterns that supported roleplaying in the system: (1) using explicit roles to set player expectations, (2) embracing the ""mask and the mirror"" effect, (3) attending to visual and interactional details, and (4) easing the player gently into the roleplaying experience. These patterns speak to a broader need to support roleplay through explicit scaffolding of desired player behaviors in digital narrative experiences.","

The use of explicit roles and character identification in virtual reality can lead to a blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy, making it difficult for individuals to distinguish between their virtual and real-life identities. This can result in a loss of personal identity and a decrease in the ability to form meaningful connections with others in the real world. Additionally, the immersive nature of virtual reality can lead to a sense of detachment from the physical world and a decrease in the desire to engage in real-world activities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376762,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

For this study, we interviewed 30 individuals living with depression to explore their technology and social media use. We find that these individuals demonstrated emergent practices related to self-regulation, such as learning to monitor and adjust technology use to improve their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral health. Our findings add a human-centered viewpoint to the relationship between living with depression and technology and social media use. We present design implications of these findings for better empowering individuals with depression to encourage their natural inclinations to self-regulate technology and social media use.","Social media use can negatively impact emotional, cognitive, and behavioral health, particularly for individuals living with depression.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376773,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Broadening Exposure to Socio-Political Opinions via a Pushy Smart Home Device,"Motivated by the effects of the filter bubble and echo chamber phenomena on social media, we developed a smart home device, Spkr, that unpredictably ""pushes"" socio-political discussion topics into the home. The device utilised trending Twitter discussions, categorised by their socio-political alignment, to present people with a purposefully assorted range of viewpoints. We deployed Spkr in 10 homes for 28 days with a diverse range of participants and interviewed them about their experiences. Our results show that Spkr presents a novel means of combating selective exposure to socio-political issues, providing participants with identifiably diverse viewpoints. Moreover, Spkr acted as a conversational prompt for discussion within the home, initiating collective processes and engaging those who would not often be involved in political discussions. We demonstrate how smart home assistants can be used as a catalyst for provocation by altering and pluralising political discussions within households.","

The device may present a novel means of combating selective exposure to socio-political issues, but it also risks creating a sense of unease and discomfort among users who may not want to engage in political discussions in their own homes. The device's unpredictable nature may lead to unexpected and potentially confrontational conversations, which could be harmful to relationships within the household. Additionally, the device's use of trending Twitter discussions may perpetuate the echo chamber effect, where users are only exposed to viewpoints that align with their own, rather than being exposed to a diversity of perspectives.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376774,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
"Sara, the Lecturer: Improving Learning in Online Education with a Scaffolding-Based Conversational Agent","Enrollment in online courses has sharply increased in higher education. Although online education can be scaled to large audiences, the lack of interaction between educators and learners is difficult to replace and remains a primary challenge in the field. Conversational agents may alleviate this problem by engaging in natural interaction and by scaffolding learners' understanding similarly to educators. However, whether this approach can also be used to enrich online video lectures has largely remained unknown. We developed Sara, a conversational agent that appears during an online video lecture. She provides scaffolds by voice and text when needed and includes a voice-based input mode. An evaluation with 182 learners in a 2 x 2 lab experiment demonstrated that Sara, compared to more traditional conversational agents, significantly improved learning in a programming task. This study highlights the importance of including scaffolding and voice-based conversational agents in online videos to improve meaningful learning.","

The use of conversational agents like Sara in online education may lead to a lack of human interaction and personal connection between educators and learners, potentially negatively impacting the learning experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376781,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
InChorus: Designing Consistent Multimodal Interactions for Data Visualization on Tablet Devices,"While tablet devices are a promising platform for data visualization, supporting consistent interactions across different types of visualizations on tablets remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present multimodal interactions that function consistently across different visualizations, supporting common operations during visual data analysis. By considering standard interface elements (e.g., axes, marks) and grounding our design in a set of core concepts including operations, parameters, targets, and instruments, we systematically develop interactions applicable to different visualization types. To exemplify how the proposed interactions collectively facilitate data exploration, we employ them in a tablet-based system, InChorus that supports pen, touch, and speech input. Based on a study with 12 participants performing replication and factchecking tasks with InChorus, we discuss how participants adapted to using multimodal input and highlight considerations for future multimodal visualization systems.","

Fake News on Facebook and Twitter: Investigating How People (Don't) Investigate,"With misinformation proliferating online and more people getting news from social media, it is crucial to understand how people assess and interact with low-credibility posts. This study explores how users react to fake news posts on their Facebook or Twitter feeds, as if posted by someone they follow. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 participants who use social media regularly for news, temporarily caused fake news to appear in their feeds with a browser extension unbeknownst to them, and observed as they walked us through their feeds. We found various reasons why people do not investigate low-credibility posts, including taking trusted posters' content at face value, as well as not wanting to spend the extra time. We also document people's investigative methods for determining credibility using both platform affordances and their own ad-hoc strategies. Based on our findings, we present design recommendations for supporting users when investigating low-credibility posts.","People are not verifying the credibility of information they see on social media, leading to the spread of misinformation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376784,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Toward Immersive Self-Driving Simulations: Reports from a User Study across Six Platforms,"As self-driving car technology matures, autonomous vehicle research is moving toward building more human-centric interfaces and accountable experiences. Driving simulators avoid many ethical and regulatory concerns about self-driving cars and play a key role in testing new interfaces or autonomous driving scenarios. However, apart from validity studies for manual driving simulation, the capabilities of driving simulators in replicating the experience of self-driving cars have not been widely investigated. In this paper, we build six self-driving simulation platforms with varying levels of visual and motion fidelities ranging from a screen-based in-lab simulator to the mixed-reality on-road simulator we propose. We compare the sense of presence and simulator sickness for each simulator composition, as well as its visual and motion fidelities with a user study. Our novel mixed-reality automotive driving simulator, named MAXIM, showed highest fidelity and presence. Our findings suggest how visual and motion configurations affect experience in autonomous driving simulators.","

Would you do it?: Enacting Moral Dilemmas in Virtual Reality for Understanding Ethical Decision-Making,"A moral dilemma is a decision-making paradox without unambiguously acceptable or preferable options. This paper investigates if and how the virtual enactment of two renowned moral dilemmas---the Trolley and the Mad Bomber---influence decision-making when compared with mentally visualizing such situations. We conducted two user studies with two gender-balanced samples of 60 participants in total that compared between paper-based and virtual-reality (VR) conditions, while simulating 5 distinct scenarios for the Trolley dilemma, and 4 storyline scenarios for the Mad Bomber's dilemma. Our findings suggest that the VR enactment of moral dilemmas further fosters utilitarian decision-making, while it amplifies biases such as sparing juveniles and seeking retribution. Ultimately, we theorize that the VR enactment of renowned moral dilemmas can yield ecologically-valid data for training future Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems on ethical decision-making, and we elicit early design principles for the training of such systems.","

Choice of Voices: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Text-to-Speech Voice Quality for Long-Form Content,"The advancement of text-to-speech (TTS) voices and a rise of commercial TTS platforms allow people to easily experience TTS voices across a variety of technologies, applications, and form factors. As such, we evaluated TTS voices for long-form content: not individual words or sentences, but voices that are pleasant to listen to for several minutes at a time. We introduce a method using a crowdsourcing platform and an online survey to evaluate voices based on listening experience, perception of clarity and quality, and comprehension. We evaluated 18 TTS voices, three human voices, and a text-only control condition. We found that TTS voices are close to rivaling human voices, yet no single voice outperforms the others across all evaluation dimensions. We conclude with considerations for selecting text-to-speech voices for long-form content.","
The advancement of TTS technology can lead to a decrease in the quality of human voices, as people become more accustomed to the robotic sound of TTS voices. This can result in a loss of personal connection and emotional depth in communication, as well as a potential decline in the ability to understand and appreciate the nuances of human speech.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376789,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
StoryMakAR: Bringing Stories to Life With An Augmented Reality & Physical Prototyping Toolkit for Youth,"Makerspaces can support educational experiences in prototyping for children. Storytelling platforms enable high levels of creativity and expression, but have high barriers of entry. We introduce StoryMakAR, which combines making and storytelling. StoryMakAR is a new AR-IoT system for children that uses block programming, physical prototyping, and event-based storytelling to bring stories to life. We reduce the barriers to entry for youth (Age=14-18) by designing an accessible, plug-and-play system through merging both electro-mechanical devices and virtual characters to create stories. We describe our initial design process, the evolution and workflow of StoryMakAR, and results from multiple single-session workshops with 33 high school students. Our preliminary studies led us to understand what students want to make. We provide evidence of how students both engage and have difficulties with maker-based storytelling. We also discuss the potential for StoryMakAR to be used as a learning environment for classrooms and younger students.","

Body Follows Eye: Unobtrusive Posture Manipulation Through a Dynamic Content Position in Virtual Reality,"While virtual objects are likely to be a part of future interfaces, we lack knowledge of how the dynamic position of virtual objects influences users' posture. In this study, we investigated users' posture change following the unobtrusive and swift motions of a content window in virtual reality (VR). In two perception studies, we estimated the perception threshold on undetectable slow motions and displacement during an eye blink. In a formative study, we compared users' performance, posture change as well as subjective responses on unobtrusive, swift, and no motions. Based on the result, we designed concept applications and explored potential design space of moving virtual content for unobtrusive posture change. With our study, we discuss the interfaces that control users and the initial design guidelines of unobtrusive posture manipulation.","Users' posture may be negatively affected by the dynamic position of virtual objects in AR/VR, potentially leading to discomfort, fatigue, or even long-term health issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376794,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Virtual Field Studies: Conducting Studies on Public Displays in Virtual Reality,"Field studies on public displays can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. We investigate the feasibility of using virtual reality (VR) as a test-bed to evaluate deployments of public displays. Specifically, we investigate whether results from virtual field studies, conducted in a virtual public space, would match the results from a corresponding real-world setting. We report on two empirical user studies where we compared audience behavior around a virtual public display in the virtual world to audience behavior around a real public display. We found that virtual field studies can be a powerful research tool, as in both studies we observed largely similar behavior between the settings. We discuss the opportunities, challenges, and limitations of using virtual reality to conduct field studies, and provide lessons learned from our work that can help researchers decide whether to employ VR in their research and what factors to account for if doing so.","

"""I'm hoping they're an ethical company that won't do anything that I'll regret"": Users Perceptions of At-home DNA Testing Companies","At-home DNA testing has become increasingly popular due to the ability to be able to gain both ancestry and health information, as well as connect with others who share your DNA. Do users have reasonable mental models of how these systems work? Do users have privacy concerns and what do they understand as the benefits and risks involved? We conducted 27 interviews with Canadian users of at-home DNA testing companies. Our interviews covered perceived and desired data use, data management, data sharing practices, control over data, and any regrets. Our qualitative analysis revealed that many users have inconsistencies in their mental models and liken their DNA data to their data stored with existing technologies, such as social media, rather than health data. They are generally either dismissive of privacy concerns towards themselves or their relatives or they had not considered privacy in their choice. We discuss our findings and propose possible future work in this area.","Users of at-home DNA testing kits have inconsistent mental models of how their data is used and often liken it to social media data rather than health data, leading to a lack of concern for privacy and potential risks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376800,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
HiveFive: Immersion Preserving Attention Guidance in Virtual Reality,"Recent advances in Virtual Reality (VR) technology, such as larger fields of view, have made VR increasingly immersive. However, a larger field of view often results in a user focusing on certain directions and missing relevant content presented elsewhere on the screen. With HiveFive, we propose a technique that uses swarm motion to guide user attention in VR. The goal is to seamlessly integrate directional cues into the scene without losing immersiveness. We evaluate HiveFive in two studies. First, we compare biological motion (from a prerecorded swarm) with non-biological motion (from an algorithm), finding further evidence that humans can distinguish between these motion types and that, contrary to our hypothesis, non-biological swarm motion results in significantly faster response times. Second, we compare HiveFive to four other techniques and show that it not only results in fast response times but also has the smallest negative effect on immersion.",Users may miss relevant content while focusing on certain directions in immersive VR experiences.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376803,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Trigeminal-based Temperature Illusions,"We explore a temperature illusion that uses low-powered electronics and enables the miniaturization of simple warm and cool sensations. Our illusion relies on the properties of certain scents, such as the coolness of mint or hotness of peppers. These odors trigger not only the olfactory bulb, but also the nose's trigeminal nerve, which has receptors that respond to both temperature and chemicals. To exploit this, we engineered a wearable device based on micropumps and an atomizer that emits up to three custom-made ""thermal"" scents directly to the user's nose. Breathing in these scents causes the user to feel warmer or cooler. We demonstrate how our device renders warmth and cooling sensations in virtual experiences. In our first study, we evaluated six candidate ""thermal"" scents. We found two hot-cold pairs, with one pair being less identifiable by odor. In our second study, pParticipants rated VR experiences with our device trigeminal stimulants as significantly warmer or cooler than the baseline conditions. Lastly, we believe this offers an alternative to existing thermal feedback devices, which unfortunately rely on power-hungry heat-lamps or Peltier-elements.","

The device may cause users to become reliant on the sensation of temperature change, leading to a decrease in their ability to perceive temperature changes naturally. This could result in a decrease in the user's awareness of their surroundings and potentially lead to harm if they are not able to accurately perceive temperature changes in their environment. Additionally, the use of scents to trigger temperature sensations may cause users to become desensitized to natural temperature cues, leading to a further decrease in their ability to perceive temperature changes.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376806,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
FrownOnError: Interrupting Responses from Smart Speakers by Facial Expressions,"In the conversations with smart speakers, misunderstandings of users' requests lead to erroneous responses. We propose FrownOnError, a novel interaction technique that enables users to interrupt the responses by intentional but natural facial expressions. This method leverages the human nature that the facial expression changes when we receive unexpected responses. We conducted a first user study (N=12) to understand users' intuitive reactions to the correct and incorrect responses. Our results reveal the significant difference in the frequency of occurrence and intensity of users' facial expressions between two conditions, and frowning and raising eyebrows are intuitive to perform and easy to control. Our second user study (N=16) evaluated the user experience and interruption efficiency of FrownOnError and the third user study (N=12) explored suitable conversation recovery strategies after the interruptions. Our results show that FrownOnError can be accurately detected (precision: 97.4%, recall: 97.6%), provides the most timely interruption compared to the baseline methods of wake-up word and button press, and is rated as most intuitive and easiest to be performed by users.",Misunderstandings of users' requests by smart speakers can lead to erroneous responses.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376810,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Soma Design and Sensory Misalignment,"We report on a workshop bringing together researchers working in soma design and sensory misalignment. Creating experiences that make use of sensory misalignment has become increasingly common, often associated with virtual reality research. However, little attention has been paid to how to design such experiences. We argue that the practice of soma design is a relevant candidate method for designing misalignment experiences, since soma design brings with it concepts such as estrangement and disrupting the habitual as a path to design. We further argue that sensory misalignment may in turn extend soma design methods, adding methods for explicitly disrupting sensory perception using technology interventions. Finally, we draw on the findings of that workshop to discuss the ideas of: pluralism in experience; orchestration of overall experience; as well as the broader intersection of soma design and sensory misalignment approaches.","Disruption of habitual perception and experience through sensory misalignment, potentially leading to estrangement and unfamiliarity with one's own body and surroundings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376812,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"Non-Verbal Auditory Input for Controlling Binary, Discrete, and Continuous Input in Automotive User Interfaces","Using auditory input while driving is becoming increasingly popular for making distraction-free inputs while driving. However, we argue that auditory input is more than just using speech. Thus, in this work, we explore using Non-Verbal Auditory Input (NVAI) for interacting with smart assistants while driving. Through an online study with 100 participants, we initially investigated users' input preferences for binary, discrete, and continuous data types. After identifying the top three modalities for NVAI, we subsequently conducted an in-person study with 16 participants. In our study, the participants tested these input modalities for three different input data types regarding their accuracy, driver-distraction, and social acceptability, while operating a driving simulator. The results reveal that, although clapping hands for making input was initially preferred in our online survey, it is snapping fingers for binary input and discrete input and humming for making continuous input that is the preferred NVAI modality while driving.","

Improving Reliability of Virtual Collision Responses: A Cue Integration Technique,"In virtual reality (VR), a user's virtual avatar can interact with a virtual object by colliding with it. If collision responses do not occur in the direction that the user expects, the user experiences degradation of accuracy and precision in applications such as VR sports games. In determining the response of a virtual collision, existing physics engines have not considered the direction in which the user perceived and estimated the collision. Based on the cue integration theory, this study presents a statistical model explaining how users estimate the direction of a virtual collision from their body's orientation and velocity vectors. The accuracy and precision of virtual collisions can be improved by 8.77% and 30.29%, respectively, by setting the virtual collision response in the direction that users perceive.","Inaccurate and imprecise virtual collisions in VR sports games, leading to degraded user experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376819,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
RunAhead: Exploring Head Scanning based Navigation for Runners,"Navigation systems for runners commonly provide turn-by-turn directions via voice and/or map-based visualizations. While voice directions require permanent attention, map-based guidance requires regular consultation. Both disrupt the running activity. To address this, we designed RunAhead, a navigation system using head scanning to query for navigation feedback, and we explored its suitability for runners in an outdoor experiment. In our design, we provide the runner with simple and intuitive navigation feedback on the path s/he is looking at through three different feedback modes: haptic, music and audio cues. In our experiment, we compare the resulting three versions of RunAhead with a baseline voice-based navigation system. We find that demand and error are equivalent across all four conditions. However, the head scanning based haptic and music conditions are preferred over the baseline and these preferences are impacted by runners' habits. With this study we contribute insights for designing navigation support for runners.","

"""It Should Be a Game for Fun, Not Exercise"": Tensions in Designing Health-Related Features for Pokémon GO","Leveraging existing popular games such as Pokémon GO to promote health can engage people in healthy activities without sacrificing gaming appeal. However, little is known about what potential tensions arise from incorporating new health-related features to already existing and popular games and how to resolve those tensions from players' perspectives. In this paper, we identify design tensions surrounding the appeals of Pokémon GO, perspectives on different health needs, and mobile health technologies. By conducting surveys and design workshops with 20 avid Pokémon GO players, we demonstrate four design tensions: (1) diverse goals and rewards vs. data accuracy, (2) strong bonds between players and characters vs. gaming obsession, (3) collaborative play vs. social anxiety, and (4) connection of in-real-life experiences with the game vs. different individual contexts. We provide design implications to resolve these tensions in Pokémon GO and discuss how to extend our findings to the broader context of health promotion in location-based games.","

Incorporating health-related features into popular games like Pokémon GO can create tensions between players' desire for engaging gameplay and the need to promote healthy behaviors. Players may feel pressured to prioritize data accuracy over diverse goals and rewards, experience social anxiety in collaborative play, or struggle to balance their attachment to game characters with the need to maintain a healthy gaming habit. These tensions can negatively impact the effectiveness of health promotion efforts and potentially lead to gaming obsession or decreased player engagement.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376830,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Mix&Match: Towards Omitting Modelling Through In-situ Remixing of Model Repository Artifacts in Mixed Reality,"The accessibility of tools to model artifacts is one of the core driving factors for the adoption of Personal Fabrication. Subsequently, model repositories like Thingiverse became important tools in (novice) makers' processes. They allow them to shorten or even omit the design process, offloading a majority of the effort to other parties. However, steps like measurement of surrounding constraints (e.g., clearance) which exist only inside the users' environment, can not be similarly outsourced. We propose Mix&Match a mixed-reality-based system which allows users to browse model repositories, preview the models in-situ, and adapt them to their environment in a simple and immediate fashion. Mix&Match aims to provide users with CSG operations which can be based on both virtual and real geometry. We present interaction patterns and scenarios for Mix&Match, arguing for the combination of mixed reality and model repositories. This enables almost modelling-free personal fabrication for both novices and expert makers.","

The increased reliance on model repositories and outsourcing of design processes could lead to a loss of critical thinking and problem-solving skills among users, as they rely more heavily on pre-existing designs and tools rather than developing their own skills and knowledge.

WalkingVibe: Reducing Virtual Reality Sickness and Improving Realism while Walking in VR using Unobtrusive Head-mounted Vibrotactile Feedback,"Virtual Reality (VR) sickness is common with symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and disorientation, and is a major barrier to using VR. We propose WalkingVibe, which applies unobtrusive vibrotactile feedback for VR walking experiences, and also reduces VR sickness and discomfort while improving realism. Feedback is delivered through two small vibration motors behind the ears at a frequency that strikes a balance in inducing vestibular response while minimizing annoyance. We conducted a 240-person study to explore how visual, audio, and various tactile feedback designs affect the locomotion experience of users walking passively in VR while seated statically in reality. Results showed timing and location for tactile feedback have significant effects on VR sickness and realism. With WalkingVibe, 2-sided step-synchronized design significantly reduces VR sickness and discomfort while significantly improving realism. Furthermore, its unobtrusiveness and ease of integration make WalkingVibe a practical approach for improving VR experiences with new and existing VR headsets.","VR sickness, including headaches, nausea, and disorientation, which can be a major barrier to using VR technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376847,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"Heatmaps, Shadows, Bubbles, Rays: Comparing Mid-Air Pen Position Visualizations in Handheld AR","In Handheld Augmented Reality, users look at AR scenes through the smartphone held in their hand. In this setting, having a mid-air pointing device like a pen in the other hand greatly expands the interaction possibilities. For example, it lets users create 3D sketches and models while on the go. However, perceptual issues in Handheld AR make it difficult to judge the distance of a virtual object, making it hard to align a pen to it. To address this, we designed and compared different visualizations of the pen's position in its virtual environment, measuring pointing precision, task time, activation patterns, and subjective ratings of helpfulness, confidence, and comprehensibility of each visualization. While all visualizations resulted in only minor differences in precision and task time, subjective ratings of perceived helpfulness and confidence favor a 'heatmap' technique that colors the objects in the scene based on their distance to the pen.","

Determining the Extractive Casting Mold of Intimate Platforms through Document Theory,"This paper introduces document theory as a mechanism to analyze intimate platforms as sociotechnical systems. The theory, developed in documentation studies and applied to HCI, focuses on the casting mold or how agents, through particular means and modes, produce documents that govern social relations. We studied the process of creating a profile by identifying and mapping out the fields asked among the ten most popular online dating apps in the US. By looking at dating profiles as documents and their creation as a process of documentation, we argue that the current casting mold of these intimate platforms is designed to extract profit via invisibilization of labor in digital networks leading to the emergence of a constrained rational market agent. Our study illustrates how document theory makes visible the assumptions of technological systems, calling on us to imagine alternatives beyond incremental design changes given broader structural realities of market and power.","Social Media platforms are designed to extract profit by invisibilizing labor in digital networks, leading to the emergence of a constrained rational market agent.

Walk The Line: Leveraging Lateral Shifts of the Walking Path as an Input Modality for Head-Mounted Displays,"Recent technological advances have made head-mounted displays (HMDs) smaller and untethered, fostering the vision of ubiquitous interaction in a digitally augmented physical world. Consequently, a major part of the interaction with such devices will happen on the go, calling for interaction techniques that allow users to interact while walking. In this paper, we explore lateral shifts of the walking path as a hands-free input modality. The available input options are visualized as lanes on the ground parallel to the user's walking path. Users can select options by shifting the walking path sideways to the respective lane. We contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 18 participants, confirming the viability of our approach for fast, accurate, and joyful interactions. Further, based on the findings of the controlled experiment, we present three example applications.","

We extend this comparison to a novel composition task, using a protocol that enables a controlled comparison with transcription. Results show that both composing and transcribing with speech is faster than typing. But, the magnitude of this difference is lower with composition, and speech has a lower error rate than keyboard during composition, but not during transcription. When transcribing, speech outperformed typing in most NASA-TLX measures, but when composing, there were no significant differences between typing and speech for any measure except physical demand.","Speech recognition technology can lead to faster but less accurate composition, with potential negative impacts on writing quality and critical thinking skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376861,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Voice+Tactile: Augmenting In-vehicle Voice User Interface with Tactile Touchpad Interaction,"Promisingly, driving is adapting to a Voice User Interface (VUI) that lets drivers utilize diverse applications with little effort. However, the VUI has innate usability issues, such as a turn-taking problem, a short-term memory workload, inefficient controls, and difficulty correcting errors. To overcome these weaknesses, we explored supplementing the VUI with tactile interaction. As an early result, we present the Voice+Tactile interactions that augment the VUI via multi-touch inputs and high-resolution tactile outputs. We designed various Voice+Tactile interactions to support different VUI interaction stages and derived four Voice+Tactile interaction themes: Status Feedback, Input Adjustment, Output Control, and Finger Feedforward. A user study showed that the Voice+Tactile interactions improved the VUI efficiency and its user experiences without incurring significant additional distraction overhead on driving. We hope these early results open new research questions to improve in-vehicle VUI with a tactile channel.","Voice User Interface (VUI) in driving has innate usability issues such as turn-taking problem, short-term memory workload, inefficient controls, and difficulty correcting errors, which can lead to distraction and decreased safety on the road.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376863,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience

This feedback has been applied to the head, body, and upper limbs to simulate rich physical properties in virtual reality (VR). However, how to expand the benefit of skin stretch feedback and apply it to the lower limbs, remains to be explored. Our first two psychophysical studies examined the minimum changes in skin stretch distance and stretch angle that are perceivable by participants. We then designed and implemented Gaiters, a pair of ungrounded, leg-worn devices, each of which is able to generate multiple two-dimensional skin stretches on the skin of the user's leg. With Gaiters, we conducted an exploratory study to understand participants' experiences when coupling skin stretch patterns with various lower limb actions. The results indicate that rich haptic experiences can be created by our prototype. Finally, a user evaluation indicates that participants enjoyed the experiences when using Gaiters and considered skin stretch as compelling haptic feedback on the legs.",Users may become too reliant on virtual sensations and neglect real-world sensory experiences.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376865,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Investigating Representation of Text and Audio in Educational VR using Learning Outcomes and EEG,"This paper reports findings from a between-subjects experiment that investigates how different learning content representations in virtual environments (VE) affect the process and outcomes of learning. Seventy-eight participants were subjected to an immersive virtual reality (VR) application, where they received identical instructional information, rendered in three different formats: as text in an overlay interface, as text embedded semantically in a virtual book, or as audio. Learning outcome measures, self-reports, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) were used to compare conditions. Results show that reading was superior to listening for the learning outcomes of retention, self-efficacy, and extraneous attention. Reading text from a virtual book was reported to be less cognitively demanding, compared to reading from an overlay interface. EEG analyses show significantly lower theta and higher alpha activation in the audio condition. The findings provide important considerations for the design of educational VR environments.","

Automated Class Discovery and One-Shot Interactions for Acoustic Activity Recognition,"Acoustic activity recognition has emerged as a foundational element for imbuing devices with context-driven capabilities, enabling richer, more assistive, and more accommodating computational experiences. Traditional approaches rely either on custom models trained in situ, or general models pre-trained on preexisting data, with each approach having accuracy and user burden implications. We present Listen Learner, a technique for activity recognition that gradually learns events specific to a deployed environment while minimizing user burden. Specifically, we built an end-to-end system for self-supervised learning of events labelled through one-shot interaction. We describe and quantify system performance 1) on preexisting audio datasets, 2) on real-world datasets we collected, and 3) through user studies which uncovered system behaviors suitable for this new type of interaction. Our results show that our system can accurately and automatically learn acoustic events across environments (e.g., 97% precision, 87% recall), while adhering to users' preferences for non-intrusive interactive behavior.","

The development of voice assistant technology, such as acoustic activity recognition, can lead to a loss of privacy for users. With the ability to constantly listen and learn from a user's environment, these devices can collect and store large amounts of personal data without the user's knowledge or consent. This can lead to targeted advertising and other invasive practices, ultimately degrading the user's privacy and autonomy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376875,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Autonomous Vehicle-Cyclist Interaction: Peril and Promise,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will redefine interactions between road users. Presently, cyclists and drivers communicate through implicit cues (vehicle motion) and explicit but imprecise signals (hand gestures, horns). Future AVs could consistently communicate awareness and intent and other feedback to cyclists based on their sensor data. We present an exploration of AV-cyclist interaction, starting with preliminary design studies which informed the implementation of an immersive VR AV-cyclist simulator, and the design and evaluation of a number of AV-cyclist interfaces. Our findings suggest that AV-cyclist interfaces can improve rider confidence in lane merging scenarios. We contribute an AV-cyclist immersive simulator, insights on trade-offs of various aspects of AV-cyclist interaction design including modalities, location, and complexity, and positive results suggesting improved rider confidence due to AV-cyclist interaction. While we are encouraged by the potential positive impact AV-cyclist interfaces can have on cyclist culture, we also emphasize the risks over-reliance can pose to cyclists.",Over-reliance on technology can pose risks to cyclists.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376884,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"""They Don't Leave Us Alone Anywhere We Go"": Gender and Digital Abuse in South Asia","South Asia faces one of the largest gender gaps online globally, and online safety is one of the main barriers to gender-equitable Internet access [GSMA, 2015]. To better understand the gendered risks and coping practices online in South Asia, we present a qualitative study of the online abuse experiences and coping practices of 199 people who identified as women and 6 NGO staff from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, using a feminist analysis. We found that a majority of our participants regularly contended with online abuse, experiencing three major abuse types: cyberstalking, impersonation, and personal content leakages. Consequences of abuse included emotional harm, reputation damage, and physical and sexual violence. Participants coped through informal channels rather than through technological protections or law enforcement. Altogether, our findings point to opportunities for designs, policies, and algorithms to improve women's safety online in South Asia.","Online abuse, including cyberstalking, impersonation, and personal content leakages, which can result in emotional harm, reputation damage, and physical and sexual violence, disproportionately affecting women in South Asia.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300232,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Seeing with New Eyes: Designing for In-the-Wild Museum Gifting,"This paper presents the GIFT smartphone app, an artist-led Research through Design project benefitting from a three-day in-the-wild deployment. The app takes as its premise the generative potential of combining the contexts of gifting and museum visits. Visitors explore the museum, searching for objects that would most appeal to the gift-receiver they have in mind, then photographing those objects and adding audio messages for their receivers describing the motivation for their choices. This paper charts the designers' key aim of creating a new frame of mind using voice, and the most striking findings discovered during in-the-wild deployment in a museum -- 'seeing with new eyes' and fostering personal connections. We discuss empathy, motivation, and bottom-up personalisation in the productive space revealed by this combination of contexts. We suggest that this work reveals opportunities for designers of gifting services as well as those working in cultural heritage.","

The use of voice assistants in museums can lead to a lack of personal connection and empathy between visitors and the artwork, as they rely on technology to provide information rather than engaging with the pieces themselves. This can result in a superficial understanding of the art and a missed opportunity for deeper connection and appreciation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300235,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Casual Microtasking: Embedding Microtasks in Facebook,"Microtasks enable people with limited time and context to contribute to a larger task. In this paper we explore casual microtasking, where microtasks are embedded into other primary activities so that they are available to be completed when convenient. We present a casual microtasking experience that inserts writing microtasks from an existing microwriting tool into the user's Facebook feed. From a two-week deployment of the system with nine people, we observe that casual microtasking enabled participants to get things done during their breaks, and that they tended to do so only after first engaging with Facebook's social content. Participants were most likely to complete the writing microtasks during periods of the day associated with low focus, and would occasionally use them as a springboard to open the original document in Word. These findings suggest casual microtasking can help people leverage spare micromoments to achieve meaningful micro-goals, and even encourage them to return to work.","Social Media platforms like Facebook can make people less productive by inserting microtasks into their feed, which can distract them from their primary work and make them spend more time on the platform.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300249,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Making Sense of Art: Access for Gallery Visitors with Vision Impairments,"While there is widespread recognition of the need to provide people with vision impairments (PVI) equitable access to cultural institutions such as art galleries, this is not easy. We present the results of a collaboration with a regional art gallery who wished to open their collection to PVIs in the local community. We describe a novel model that provides three different ways of accessing the gallery, depending upon visual acuity and mobility: virtual tours, self-guided tours and guided tours. As far as possible the model supports autonomous exploration by PVIs. It was informed by a value sensitive design exploration of the values and value conflicts of the primary stakeholders.","
The article highlights the difficulty in providing equitable access to cultural institutions for people with vision impairments, and the need for a novel model that accommodates different visual acuity and mobility needs. However, the focus on virtual tours, self-guided tours, and guided tours may inadvertently perpetuate dependence on technology and diminish the opportunity for PVIs to engage with art in a more immersive and autonomous way. The emphasis on technology may also overlook the importance of human interaction and tactile experiences in art appreciation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300250,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Emotional Utility and Recall of the Facebook News Feed,"We report a laboratory study (N=53) in which participants browsed their own Facebook news feeds for 10-15 minutes, choosing exactly when to quit, and later rated the overall emotional utility of the episode before attempting to recall threads. Finally, the emotional utility of each encountered thread was rated while looking over a recording of the interaction. We report that Facebook browsing was, overall, an emotionally positive experience; that recall of threads exhibited classic primacy and recency serial order effects; that recalled threads were both more positive and more valenced (less neutral) on average, than forgotten threads; and that overall emotional valence judgments were predicted, statistically, by the peak and end thread judgments. We find no evidence that local quit decisions were driven by the emotional utility of threads. In the light of these findings, we discuss the suggestion that emotional utility might partly explain the attractiveness of reading the news feed, and that an emotional memory bias might further increase the attractiveness of the newsfeed in prospect.","Social media platforms like Facebook can create an emotional memory bias, where users tend to remember positive experiences and forget negative ones, leading to an unrealistic view of the platform's emotional utility. This can make users more likely to spend excessive time scrolling through their feeds, potentially leading to addiction and decreased productivity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300252,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Impact of Contextual Factors on Snapchat Public Sharing,"Public sharing is integral to online platforms. This includes the popular multimedia messaging application Snapchat, on which public sharing is relatively new and unexplored in prior research. In mobile-first applications, sharing contexts are dynamic. However, it is unclear how context impacts users' sharing decisions. As platforms increasingly rely on user-generated content, it is important to also broadly understand user motivations and considerations in public sharing. We explored these aspects of content sharing through a survey of 1,515 Snapchat users. Our results indicate that users primarily have intrinsic motivations for publicly sharing Snaps, such as to share an experience with the world, but also have considerations related to audience and sensitivity of content. Additionally, we found that Snaps shared publicly were contextually different from those privately shared. Our findings suggest that content sharing systems can be designed to support sharing motivations, yet also be sensitive to private contexts.","
Users primarily have intrinsic motivations for publicly sharing Snaps, such as to share an experience with the world, but also have considerations related to audience and sensitivity of content.

Can you summarize it in a way that a lay audience would understand?

Yes, of course! Here's a summary of the undesirable consequence of Social Media from the article in under 100 tokens:

Sharing on social media can be risky because users may not consider the potential audience and sensitivity of their content. People mainly share to share experiences, but they also think about who might see it. Designers can make sharing systems that support these motivations while being mindful of privacy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300256,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
"The Channel Matters: Self-disclosure, Reciprocity and Social Support in Online Cancer Support Groups","People with health concerns go to online health support groups to obtain help and advice. To do so, they frequently disclose personal details, many times in public. Although research in non-health settings suggests that people self-disclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. Our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. By automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale, we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. Although one's self-disclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. These channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.","People may disclose personal health information in public online support groups, which can lead to a loss of privacy and potential negative consequences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300261,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
At Your Service: Designing Voice Assistant Personalities to Improve Automotive User Interfaces,"This paper investigates personalized voice characters for in-car speech interfaces. In particular, we report on how we designed different personalities for voice assistants and compared them in a real world driving study. Voice assistants have become important for a wide range of use cases, yet current interfaces are using the same style of auditory response in every situation, despite varying user needs and personalities. To close this gap, we designed four assistant personalities (Friend, Admirer, Aunt, and Butler) and compared them to a baseline (Default) in a between-subject study in real traffic conditions. Our results show higher likability and trust for assistants that correctly match the user's personality while we observed lower likability, trust, satisfaction, and usefulness for incorrectly matched personalities, each in comparison with the Default character. We discuss design aspects for voice assistants in different automotive use cases.","Current voice assistants use the same style of auditory response in every situation, despite varying user needs and personalities. This can lead to lower likability, trust, satisfaction, and usefulness for users who are mismatched with the default personality.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300270,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Deaf and Hard-of-hearing Individuals' Preferences for Wearable and Mobile Sound Awareness Technologies,"To investigate preferences for mobile and wearable sound awareness systems, we conducted an online survey with 201 DHH participants. The survey explores how demographic factors affect perceptions of sound awareness technologies, gauges interest in specific sounds and sound characteristics, solicits reactions to three design scenarios (smartphone, smartwatch, head-mounted display) and two output modalities (visual, haptic), and probes issues related to social context of use. While most participants were highly interested in being aware of sounds, this interest was modulated by communication preference--that is, for sign or oral communication or both. Almost all participants wanted both visual and haptic feedback and 75% preferred to have that feedback on separate devices (e.g., haptic on smartwatch, visual on head-mounted display). Other findings related to sound type, full captions vs. keywords, sound filtering, notification styles, and social context provide direct guidance for the design of future mobile and wearable sound awareness systems.","Over-reliance on technology and decreased social interaction.

The article discusses the potential for sound awareness technology to enhance the lives of deaf and hard of hearing individuals. However, it also highlights the possibility of over-reliance on technology, which could lead to decreased social interaction and a loss of important communication skills. For example, if individuals rely solely on technology for communication, they may miss out on nonverbal cues and social nuances that are essential for effective communication. Additionally, over-reliance on technology could lead to a decrease in the use of sign language, which is an important part of Deaf culture and identity. It is important to strike a balance between the benefits of technology and the importance of maintaining social interaction and communication skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300276,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
The Impact of User Characteristics and Preferences on Performance with an Unfamiliar Voice User Interface,"Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are increasing in popularity. However, their invisible nature with no or limited visuals makes it difficult for users to interact with unfamiliar VUIs. We analyze the impact of user characteristics and preferences on how users interact with a VUI-based calendar, DiscoverCal. While recent VUI studies analyze user behavior through self-reported data, we extend this research by analyzing both VUI usage data and self-reported data to observe correlations between both data types. Results from our user study (n=50) led to four key findings: 1) programming experience did not have a wide-spread impact on performance metrics while 2) assimilation bias did, 3) participants with more technical confidence exhibited a trial-and-error approach, and 4) desiring more guidance from our VUI correlated with performance metrics that indicate cautious users.","

A Comparison of Notification Techniques for Out-of-View Objects in Full-Coverage Displays,"Full-coverage displays can place visual content anywhere on the interior surfaces of a room (e.g., a weather display near the coat stand). In these settings, digital artefacts can be located behind the user and out of their field of view - meaning that it can be difficult to notify the user when these artefacts need attention. Although much research has been carried out on notification, little is known about how best to direct people to the necessary location in room environments. We designed five diverse attention-guiding techniques for full-coverage display rooms, and evaluated them in a study where participants completed search tasks guided by the different techniques. Our study provides new results about notification in full-coverage displays: we showed benefits of persistent visualisations that could be followed all the way to the target and that indicate distance-to-target. Our findings provide useful information for improving the usability of interactive full-coverage environments.","Difficulty in notifying users when digital artifacts need attention, leading to inefficiency and frustration.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300288,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
An Evaluation of Radar Metaphors for Providing Directional Stimuli Using Non-Verbal Sound,"We compared four audio-based radar metaphors for providing directional stimuli to users of AR headsets. The metaphors are clock face, compass, white noise, and scale. Each metaphor, or method, signals the movement of a virtual arm in a radar sweep. In a user study, statistically significant differences were observed for accuracy and response time. Beat-based methods (clock face, compass) elicited responses biased to the left of the stimulus location, and non-beat-based methods (white noise, scale) produced responses biased to the right of the stimulus location. The beat methods were more accurate than the non-beat methods. However, the non-beat methods elicited quicker responses. We also discuss how response accuracy varies along the radar sweep between methods. These observations contribute design insights for non-verbal, non-visual directional prompting.","

The use of audio-based radar metaphors in AR headsets can result in biased responses, with users being more likely to respond to stimuli on one side of their field of view than the other. This can lead to inaccurate responses and slower reaction times, potentially causing problems in situations where quick and accurate responses are crucial.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300289,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Project Sidewalk: A Web-based Crowdsourcing Tool for Collecting Sidewalk Accessibility Data At Scale,"We introduce Project Sidewalk, a new web-based tool that enables online crowdworkers to remotely label pedestrian-related accessibility problems by virtually walking through city streets in Google Street View. To train, engage, and sustain users, we apply basic game design principles such as interactive onboarding, mission-based tasks, and progress dashboards. In an 18-month deployment study, 797 online users contributed 205,385 labels and audited 2,941 miles of Washington DC streets. We compare behavioral and labeling quality differences between paid crowdworkers and volunteers, investigate the effects of label type, label severity, and majority vote on accuracy, and analyze common labeling errors. To complement these findings, we report on an interview study with three key stakeholder groups (N=14) soliciting reactions to our tool and methods. Our findings demonstrate the potential of virtually auditing urban accessibility and highlight tradeoffs between scalability and quality compared to traditional approaches.","

The use of virtual tools to audit urban accessibility may lead to a lack of physical engagement and exploration of the actual environment, potentially resulting in missed accessibility issues and a reliance on technology that may not always be accurate or reliable. Additionally, the use of virtual tools may also perpetuate existing power dynamics, where those who have access to technology and online platforms have a greater say in shaping the urban environment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300292,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Moments of Change: Analyzing Peer-Based Cognitive Support in Online Mental Health Forums,"Clinical psychology literature indicates that reframing ir- rational thoughts can help bring positive cognitive change to those suffering from mental distress. Through data from an online mental health forum, we study how these cognitive processes play out in peer-to-peer conversations. Acknowledging the complexity of measuring cognitive change, we first provide an operational definition of a ""moment of change"" based on sentiment change in online conversations. Using this definition, we propose a predictive model that can identify whether a conversation thread or a post is associated with a moment of cognitive change. Consistent with psychological literature, we find that markers of language associated with sentiment and and affect are the most predictive. Further, cultural differences play an important role: predictive models trained on one country generalize poorly to others. To understand how a moment of change happens, we build a model that explicitly tracks topic and associated sentiment in a forum thread.","Social Media can hinder cognitive change and mental well-being.

Insights:

* Clinical psychology literature suggests that reframing irrational thoughts can bring positive cognitive change.
* Online peer-to-peer conversations can play a role in cognitive processes.
* Sentiment and affect markers in language are predictive of cognitive change.
* Cultural differences affect predictive models of cognitive change.

When Do People Trust Their Social Groups?,"Trust facilitates cooperation and supports positive outcomes in social groups, including member satisfaction, information sharing, and task performance. Extensive prior research has examined individuals' general propensity to trust, as well as the factors that contribute to their trust in specific groups. Here, we build on past work to present a comprehensive framework for predicting trust in groups. By surveying 6,383 Facebook Groups users about their trust attitudes and examining aggregated behavioral and demographic data for these individuals, we show that (1) an individual's propensity to trust is associated with how they trust their groups, (2) smaller, closed, older, more exclusive, or more homogeneous groups are trusted more, and (3) a group's overall friendship-network structure and an individual's position within that structure can also predict trust. Last, we demonstrate how group trust predicts outcomes at both individual and group level such as the formation of new friendship ties.","Social Media can lead to a false sense of trust and community. People may feel a sense of belonging and trust in online groups, but this can be misleading as the group's structure and individual's position within it can affect trust levels.

TORC: A Virtual Reality Controller for In-Hand High-Dexterity Finger Interaction,"Recent hand-held controllers have explored a variety of haptic feedback sensations for users in virtual reality by producing both kinesthetic and cutaneous feedback from virtual objects. These controllers are grounded to the user's hand and can only manipulate objects through arm and wrist motions, not using the dexterity of their fingers as they would in real life. In this paper, we present TORC, a rigid haptic controller that renders virtual object characteristics and behaviors such as texture and compliance. Users hold and squeeze TORC using their thumb and two fingers and interact with virtual objects by sliding their thumb on TORC's trackpad. During the interaction, vibrotactile motors produce sensations to each finger that represent the haptic feel of squeezing, shearing or turning an object. Our evaluation showed that using TORC, participants could manipulate virtual objects more precisely (e.g., position and rotate objects in 3D) than when using a conventional VR controller.",Reduced dexterity and manipulation abilities in virtual reality.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300301,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Threats, Abuses, Flirting, and Blackmail: Gender Inequity in Social Media Voice Forums","HCI4D researchers and practitioners have leveraged voice forums to enable people with literacy, socioeconomic, and connectivity barriers to access, report, and share information. Although voice forums have received impassioned usage from low-income, low-literate, rural, tribal, and disabled communities in diverse HCI4D contexts, the participation of women in these services is almost non-existent. In this paper, we investigate the reasons for the low participation of women in social media voice forums by examining the use of Sangeet Swara in India and Baang in Pakistan by marginalized women and men. Our mixed-methods approach spanning content analysis of audio posts, quantitative analysis of interactions between users, and qualitative interviews with users indicate gender inequity due to deep-rooted patriarchal values. We found that women on these forums faced systemic discrimination and encountered abusive content, flirts, threats, and harassment. We discuss design recommendations to create social media voice forums that foster gender equity in use of these services.","Women face discrimination and harassment on voice forums, leading to low participation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300302,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
Direct Finger Manipulation of 3D Object Image with Ultrasound Haptic Feedback,"In this study, we prototype and examine a system that allows a user to manipulate a 3D virtual object with multiple fingers without wearing any device. An autostereoscopic display produces a 3D image and a depth sensor measures the movement of the fingers. When a user touches a virtual object, haptic feedback is provided by ultrasound phased arrays. By estimating the cross section of the finger in contact with the virtual object and by creating a force pattern around it, it is possible for the user to recognize the position of the surface relative to the finger. To evaluate our system, we conducted two experiments to show that the proposed feedback method is effective in recognizing the object surface and thereby enables the user to grasp the object quickly without seeing it.",Users may become too reliant on technology and lose touch with reality.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300317,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
I Don't Even Have to Bother Them!: Using Social Media to Automate the Authentication Ceremony in Secure Messaging,"The privacy guaranteed by secure messaging applications relies on users completing an authentication ceremony to verify they are using the proper encryption keys. We examine the feasibility of social authentication, which partially automates the ceremony using social media accounts. We implemented social authentication in Signal and conducted a within-subject user study with 42 participants to compare this with existing methods. To generalize our results, we conducted a Mechanical Turk survey involving 421 respondents. Our results show that users found social authentication to be convenient and fast. They particularly liked verifying keys asynchronously, and viewing social media profiles naturally coincided with how participants thought of verification. However, some participants reacted negatively to integrating social media with Signal, primarily because they distrust social media services. Overall, automating the authentication ceremony and distributing trust with additional service providers is promising, but this infrastructure needs to be more trusted than social media companies.","Users may be hesitant to integrate social media with secure messaging applications due to distrust of social media services, potentially limiting the effectiveness of automated authentication methods.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300323,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Empowerment on the Margins: The Online Experiences of Community Health Workers,"Research in Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) routinely relies on and engages with the increasing penetration of smartphones and the internet. We examine the mobile, internet, and social media practices of women community health workers, for whom internet access has newly become possible. These workers are uniquely positioned at the intersections of various communities of practice---their familial units, workplaces, networks of health workers, larger communities, and the online world. However, they remain at the margins of each, on account of difference in gender, class, literacies, professional expertise, and more. Our findings unpack the legitimate peripheral participation of these workers; examining how they appropriate smartphones and the internet to move away from the peripheries to fully participate in these communities. We discuss how their activities are motivated by moves towards empowerment, digitization, and improved healthcare provision. We consider how future work might support, leverage, and extend their efforts.","Social Media can further marginalize already disadvantaged groups, such as women community health workers, due to differences in gender, class, literacies, professional expertise, and more.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300329,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Augmentation not Duplication: Considerations for the Design of Digitally-Augmented Comic Books,"Digital-augmentation of print-media can provide contextually relevant audio, visual, or haptic content to supplement the static text and images. The design of such augmentation--its medium, quantity, frequency, content, and access technique--can have a significant impact on the reading experience. In the worst case, such as where children are learning to read, the print medium can become a proxy for accessing digital content only, and the textual content is avoided. In this work, we examine how augmented content can change the reader's behaviour with a comic book. We first report on the usage of a commercially available augmented comic for children, providing evidence that a third of all readers converted to simply viewing the digital media when printed content is duplicated. Second, we explore the design space for digital content augmentation in print media. Third, we report a user study with 136 children that examined the impact of both content length and presentation in a digitally-augmented comic book. From this, we report a series of design guidelines to assist designers and editors in the development of digitally-augmented print media.","

Behavioural Biometrics in VR: Identifying People from Body Motion and Relations in Virtual Reality,"Every person is unique, with individual behavioural characteristics: how one moves, coordinates, and uses their body. In this paper we investigate body motion as behavioural biometrics for virtual reality. In particular, we look into which behaviour is suitable to identify a user. This is valuable in situations where multiple people use a virtual reality environment in parallel, for example in the context of authentication or to adapt the VR environment to users' preferences. We present a user study (N=22) where people perform controlled VR tasks (pointing, grabbing, walking, typing), monitoring their head, hand, and eye motion data over two sessions. These body segments can be arbitrarily combined into body relations, and we found that these movements and their combination lead to characteristic behavioural patterns. We present an extensive analysis of which motion/relation is useful to identify users in which tasks using classification methods. Our findings are beneficial for researchers and practitioners alike who aim to build novel adaptive and secure user interfaces in virtual reality.","

The use of body motion as a means of identification in virtual reality environments could lead to privacy concerns, as it potentially allows for the tracking and monitoring of individuals' movements and behaviors without their knowledge or consent. This could have negative implications for individuals who value their privacy and do not want their personal information to be collected and used without their control. Additionally, the use of biometric identification methods in virtual reality environments could exacerbate existing social inequalities, as some individuals may have limited access to the technology or may not be able to use it effectively due to physical or cognitive limitations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300340,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Our Friends Electric: Reflections on Advocacy and Design Research for the Voice Enabled Internet,"Emerging technologies---such as the voice enabled internet---present many opportunities and challenges for HCI research and society as a whole. Advocating for better, healthier implementations of these technologies will require us to communicate abstract values, such as trust, to an audience that ranges from the general public to technologists and even policymakers. In this paper, we show how a combination of film-making and product design can help to illustrate these abstract values. Working as part of a wider international advocacy campaign, Our Friends Electric focuses on the voice enabled internet, translating abstract notions of Internet Health into comprehensible digital futures for the relationship between our voice and the internet. We conclude with a call for designers of physical things to be more involved with the development of trust, privacy and security in this powerful emerging technological landscape.","The voice enabled internet could negatively impact trust, privacy, and security.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300344,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Playing Blind: Revealing the World of Gamers with Visual Impairment,"Previous research on games for people with visual impairment (PVI) has focused on co-designing or evaluating specific games - mostly under controlled conditions. In this research, we follow a game-agnostic, ""in-the-wild"" approach, investigating the habits, opinions and concerns of PVI regarding digital games. To explore these issues, we conducted an online survey and follow-up interviews with gamers with VI (GVI). Dominant themes from our analysis include the particular appeal of digital games to GVI, the importance of social trajectories and histories of gameplay, the need to balance complexity and accessibility in both games targeted to PVI and mainstream games, opinions about the state of the gaming industry, and accessibility concerns around new and emerging technologies such as VR and AR. Our study gives voice to an underrepresented group in the gaming community. Understanding the practices, experiences and motivations of GVI provides a valuable foundation for informing development of more inclusive games.","The article highlights the concern of accessibility in digital games, particularly for people with visual impairment (PVI).

Discovering Alternative Treatments for Opioid Use Recovery Using Social Media,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) poses substantial risks to personal well-being and public health. In online communities, users support those seeking recovery, in part by promoting clinically grounded treatments. However, some communities also promote clinically unverified OUD treatments, such as unregulated and untested drugs. Little research exists on which alternative treatments people use, whether these treatments are effective for recovery, or if they cause negative side effects. We provide the first large-scale social media study of clinically unverified, alternative treatments in OUD recovery on Reddit, partnering with an addiction research scientist. We adopt transfer learning across 63 subreddits to precisely identify posts related to opioid recovery. Then, we quantitatively discover potential alternative treatments and contextualize their effectiveness. Our work benefits health research and practice by identifying undiscovered recovery strategies. We also discuss the impacts to online communities dealing with stigmatized behavior and research ethics.","

"""This Girl is on Fire"": Sensemaking in an Online Health Community for Vulvodynia","Online health communities (OHCs) allow people living with a shared diagnosis or medical condition to connect with peers for social support and advice. OHCs have been well studied in conditions like diabetes and cancer, but less is known about their role in enigmatic diseases with unknown or complex causal mechanisms. In this paper, we study one such condition: Vulvodynia, a chronic pain syndrome of the vulvar region. Through observations of and interviews with members of a vulvodynia Facebook group, we found that while the interaction types are broadly similar to those found in other OHCs, the women spent more time seeking basic information and building individualized management plans. They also encounter significant emotional and interpersonal challenges, which they discuss with each other. We use this study to extend the field's understanding of OHCs, and to propose implications for the design of self-tracking tools to support sensemaking in enigmatic conditions.","

Dynamic Network Plaid: A Tool for the Analysis of Dynamic Networks,"Network data that changes over time can be very useful for studying a wide range of important phenomena, from how social network connections change to epidemiology. However, it is challenging to analyze, especially if it has many actors, connections or if the covered timespan is large with rapidly changing links (e.g., months of changes with changes at second resolution). In these analyses one would often like to compare many periods of time to others, without having to look at the full timeline. To support this kind of analysis we designed and implemented a technique and system to visualize this dynamic data. The Dynamic Network Plaid (DNP) is designed for large displays and based on user-generated interactive timeslicing on the dynamic graph attributes and on linked provenance-preserving representations. We present the technique, interface and the design/evaluation with a group of public health researchers investigating non-suicidal self-harm picture sharing in Instagram.","Social media platforms like Instagram can be used to share harmful content, such as pictures of non-suicidal self-harm, which can have negative impacts on mental health and well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300360,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Methodological Gaps in Predicting Mental Health States from Social Media: Triangulating Diagnostic Signals,"A growing body of research is combining social media data with machine learning to predict mental health states of individuals. An implication of this research lies in informing evidence-based diagnosis and treatment. However, obtaining clinically valid diagnostic information from sensitive patient populations is challenging. Consequently, researchers have operationalized characteristic online behaviors as ""proxy diagnostic signals"" for building these models. This paper posits a challenge in using these diagnostic signals, purported to support clinical decision-making. Focusing on three commonly used proxy diagnostic signals derived from social media, we find that predictive models built on these data, although offer strong internal validity, suffer from poor external validity when tested on mental health patients. A deeper dive reveals issues of population and sampling bias, as well as of uncertainty in construct validity inherent in these proxies. We discuss the methodological and clinical implications of these gaps and provide remedial guidelines for future research.","Social media data used to predict mental health states may be unreliable due to biases and uncertainty in the data, potentially leading to inaccurate diagnoses and treatments.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300364,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Putting the Value in VR: How to Systematically and Iteratively Develop a Value-Based VR Application with a Complex Target Group,"In development, implementation and evaluation of eHealth it is essential to account for stakeholders' perspectives, opinions and values, which are statements that specify what stakeholders want to achieve or improve via a technology. The use of values enables developers to systematically include stakeholders' perspectives and the context of use in an eHealth development process. However, there are relatively few papers that explain how to use values in technology development. Consequently, in this paper we show how we formulated values during the multi-method, interdisciplinary and iterative development process of a VR application for a complex setting: forensic mental healthcare. We report the main foundations for these values: the outcomes of an online questionnaire with patients, therapists and other stakeholders (n=146) and interviews with patients and therapists (n=18). We show how a multidisciplinary project team used these qualitative results to formulate and adapt values and create lo-fi prototypes of a VR application. We discuss the importance of a systematic development process with multiple formative evaluations for eHealth and reflect on the role of values within this.","

I draw on interviews with women who have experienced pregnancy loss and are social media users in the U.S. I document outcomes at the social/network, individual, and dyad levels. I highlight the powerful role of connecting with others with a similar experience within networks of known ties, how disclosures lead to relationship changes, how disclosers take on new social roles as mentors and support sources, and how helpful connections following disclosures originate from various kinds of ties via diverse communication channels. I emphasize reciprocal disclosures as an outcome contributing to further outcomes (e.g., destigmatizing pregnancy loss).

Virtual Showdown: An Accessible Virtual Reality Game with Scaffolds for Youth with Visual Impairments,"Virtual Reality (VR) is a growing source of entertainment, but people who are visually impaired have not been effectively included. Audio cues are motivated as a complement to visuals, making experiences more immersive, but are not a primary cue. To address this, we implemented a VR game called Virtual Showdown. We based Virtual Showdown on an accessible real-world game called Showdown, where people use their hearing to locate and hit a ball against an opponent. Further, we developed Verbal and Verbal/Vibration Scaffolds to teach people how to play Virtual Showdown. We assessed the acceptability of Virtual Showdown and compared our scaffolds in an empirical study with 34 youth who are visually impaired. Thirty-three participants wanted to play Virtual Showdown again, and we learned that participants scored higher with the Verbal Scaffold or if they had prior Showdown experience. Our empirical findings inform the design of future accessible VR experiences.","

Moderation Practices as Emotional Labor in Sustaining Online Communities: The Case of AAPI Identity Work on Reddit,"We examine how and why Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) moderators on Reddit shape the norms of their online communities through the analytic lens of emotional labor. We conduct interviews with 21 moderators who facilitate identity work discourse in AAPI subreddits and present a thematic analysis of their moderation practices. We report on their challenges to sustaining moderation, which include burning out from volunteer work, navigating hierarchical structures, and balancing unfulfilled expectations. We then describe strategies that moderators employ to manage emotional labor, which involve distancing away from drama, building solidarity from shared struggles, and integrating an ecology of tools for self-organized moderation. We provide recommendations for improving moderation in online communities centered around identity work and discuss implications of emotional labor in the design of Reddit and similar platforms.","Burnout from volunteer work, navigating hierarchical structures, and balancing unfulfilled expectations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300372,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Assessing the Accuracy of Point & Teleport Locomotion with Orientation Indication for Virtual Reality using Curved Trajectories,"Room-scale Virtual Reality (VR) systems have arrived in users' homes where tracked environments are set up in limited physical spaces. As most Virtual Environments (VEs) are larger than the tracked physical space, locomotion techniques are used to navigate in VEs. Currently, in recent VR games, point & teleport is the most popular locomotion technique. However, it only allows users to select the position of the teleportation and not the orientation that the user is facing after the teleport. This results in users having to manually correct their orientation after teleporting and possibly getting entangled by the cable of the headset. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate three different point & teleport techniques that enable users to specify the target orientation while teleporting. The results show that, although the three teleportation techniques with orientation indication increase the average teleportation time, they lead to a decreased need for correcting the orientation after teleportation.",Users may get entangled by the cable of the headset when manually correcting their orientation after teleporting in VR games that use point & teleport locomotion technique.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300377,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
r/science: Challenges and Opportunities in Online Science Communication,"Online discussion websites, such as Reddit's r/science forum, have the potential to foster science communication between researchers and the general public. However, little is known about who participates, what is discussed, and whether such websites are successful in achieving meaningful science discussions. To find out, we conducted a mixed-methods study analyzing 11,859 r/science posts and conducting interviews with 18 community members. Our results show that r/science facilitates rich information exchange and that the comments section provides a unique science communication document that guides engagement with scientific research. However, this community-sourced science communication comes largely from a knowledgeable public. We conclude with design suggestions for a number of critical problems that we uncovered: addressing the problem of topic newsworthiness and balancing broader participation and rigor.","The article highlights that online discussion websites, such as Reddit's r/science forum, can facilitate rich information exchange and community-sourced science communication.

Virtual Performance Augmentation in an Immersive Jump & Run Exergame,"Human performance augmentation through technology has been a recurring theme in science and culture, aiming to increase human capabilities and accessibility. We investigate a related concept: virtual performance augmentation (VPA), using VR to give users the illusion of greater capabilities than they actually have. We propose a method for VPA of running and jumping, based on in place movements, and studied its effects in a VR exergame. We found that in place running and jumping in VR can be used to create a somewhat natural experience and can elicit medium to high physical exertion in an immersive and intrinsically motivating manner. We also found that virtually augmenting running and jumping can increase intrinsic motivation, perceived competence and flow, and may also increase motivation for physical activity in general. We discuss implications of VPA for safety and accessibility, with initial evidence suggesting that VPA may help users with physical impairments enjoy the benefits of exergaming.","Users may become too reliant on technology and neglect physical activity, leading to decreased physical fitness and potential health problems.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300388,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being

Evaluating the Combination of Visual Communication Cues for HMD-based Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration,"Many researchers have studied various visual communication cues (e.g. pointer, sketching, and hand gesture) in Mixed Reality remote collaboration systems for real-world tasks. However, the effect of combining them has not been so well explored. We studied the effect of these cues in four combinations: hand only, hand + pointer, hand + sketch, and hand + pointer + sketch, with three problem tasks: Lego, Tangram, and Origami. The study results showed that the participants completed the task significantly faster and felt a significantly higher level of usability when the sketch cue is added to the hand gesture cue, but not with adding the pointer cue. Participants also preferred the combinations including hand and sketch cues over the other combinations. However, using additional cues (pointer or sketch) increased the perceived mental effort and did not improve the feeling of co-presence. We discuss the implications of these results and future research directions.","

Usability of Gamified Knowledge Learning in VR and Desktop-3D,"Affine Transformations (ATs) often escape an intuitive approach due to their high complexity. Therefore, we developed GEtiT that directly encodes ATs in its game mechanics and scales the knowledge's level of abstraction. This results in an intuitive application as well as audiovisual presentation of ATs and hence in a knowledge learning. We also developed a specific Virtual Reality (VR) version to explore the effects of immersive VR on the learning outcomes. This paper presents our approach of directly encoding abstract knowledge in game mechanics, the conceptual design of GEtiT and its technical implementation. Both versions are compared in regard to their usability in a user study. The results show that both GEtiT versions induce a high degree of flow and elicit a good intuitive use. They validate the effectiveness of the design and the resulting knowledge application requirements. Participants favored GEtiT VR thus showing a potentially higher learning quality when using VR.","

The use of Virtual Reality technology in educational settings may lead to a higher degree of immersion and engagement, but it may also potentially create a false sense of understanding or intuition, as users may confuse the virtual experience with real-world knowledge.

The Role of Physical Props in VR Climbing Environments,"Dealing with fear of falling is a challenge in sport climbing. Virtual reality (VR) research suggests that using physical and reality-based interaction increases the presence in VR. In this paper, we present a study that investigates the influence of physical props on presence, stress and anxiety in a VR climbing environment involving whole body movement. To help climbers overcoming fear of falling, we compared three different conditions: Climbing in reality at 10 m height, physical climbing in VR (with props attached to the climbing wall) and virtual climbing in VR using game controllers. From subjective reports and biosignals, our results show that climbing with props in VR increases the anxiety and sense of realism in VR for sport climbing.

Experimental Analysis of Barehand Mid-air Mode-Switching Techniques in Virtual Reality,"We present an empirical comparison of eleven bare hand, mid-air mode-switching techniques suitable for virtual reality in two experiments. The first evaluates seven techniques spanning dominant and non-dominant hand actions. Techniques represent common classes of actions selected by a methodical examination of 56 examples of prior art. The standard ""subtraction method"" protocol is adapted for 3D interfaces, with two baseline selection methods, bare hand pinch and device controller button. A second experiment with four techniques explores more subtle dominant-hand techniques and the effect of using a dominant hand device for selection. Results provide guidance to practitioners when choosing bare hand, mid-air mode-switching techniques, and for researchers when designing new mode-switching methods in VR.","

Designing Interactive 3D Printed Models with Teachers of the Visually Impaired,"Students with visual impairments struggle to learn various concepts in the academic curriculum because diagrams, images, and other visual are not accessible to them. To address this, researchers have design interactive 3D printed models (I3Ms) that provide audio descriptions when a user touches components of a model. In prior work, I3Ms were designed on an ad hoc basis, and it is currently unknown what general guidelines produce effective I3M designs. To address this gap, we conducted two studies with Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVIs). First, we led two design workshops with 35 TVIs, who modified sample models and added interactive elements to them. Second, we worked with three TVIs to design three I3Ms in an iterative instructional design process. At the end of this process, the TVIs used the I3Ms we designed to teach their students. We conclude that I3Ms should (1) have effective tactile features (e.g., distinctive patterns between components), (2) contain both auditory and visual content (e.g., explanatory animations), and (3) consider pedagogical methods (e.g., overview before details).","

Defending My Castle: A Co-Design Study of Privacy Mechanisms for Smart Homes,"Home is a person's castle, a private and protected space. Internet-connected devices such as locks, cameras, and speakers might make a home ""smarter"" but also raise privacy issues because these devices may constantly and inconspicuously collect, infer or even share information about people in the home. To explore user-centered privacy designs for smart homes, we conducted a co-design study in which we worked closely with diverse groups of participants in creating new designs. This study helps fill the gap in the literature between studying users' privacy concerns and designing privacy tools only by experts. Our participants' privacy designs often relied on simple strategies, such as data localization, disconnection from the Internet, and a private mode. From these designs, we identified six key design factors: data transparency and control, security, safety, usability and user experience, system intelligence, and system modality. We discuss how these factors can guide design for smart home privacy.","Privacy issues due to constant and inconspicuous collection, inference, or sharing of information about people in the home through internet-connected devices such as locks, cameras, and speakers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300428,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Understanding Perceptions of Problematic Facebook Use: When People Experience Negative Life Impact and a Lack of Control,"While many people use social network sites to connect with friends and family, some feel that their use is problematic, seriously affecting their sleep, work, or life. Pairing a survey of 20,000 Facebook users measuring perceptions of problematic use with behavioral and demographic data, we examined Facebook activities associated with problematic use as well as the kinds of people most likely to experience it. People who feel their use is problematic are more likely to be younger, male, and going through a major life event such as a breakup. They spend more time on the platform, particularly at night, and spend proportionally more time looking at profiles and less time browsing their News Feeds. They also message their friends more frequently. While they are more likely to respond to notifications, they are also more likely to deactivate their accounts, perhaps in an effort to better manage their time. Further, they are more likely to have seen content about social media or phone addiction. Notably, people reporting problematic use rate the site as more valuable to them, highlighting the complex relationship between technology use and well-being.

Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration Combining 360 Video and 3D Reconstruction,"Remote Collaboration using Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) has recently become a popular way for people from different places to work together. Local workers can collaborate with remote helpers by sharing 360-degree live video or 3D virtual reconstruction of their surroundings. However, each of these techniques has benefits and drawbacks. In this paper we explore mixing 360 video and 3D reconstruction together for remote collaboration, by preserving benefits of both systems while reducing drawbacks of each. We developed a hybrid prototype and conducted user study to compare benefits and problems of using 360 or 3D alone to clarify the needs for mixing the two, and also to evaluate the prototype system. We found participants performed significantly better on collaborative search tasks in 360 and felt higher social presence, yet 3D also showed potential to complement. Participant feedback collected after trying our hybrid system provided directions for improvement.","

Editing Spatial Layouts through Tactile Templates for People with Visual Impairments,"Spatial layout is a key component in graphic design. While people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) can use screen readers or magnifiers to access digital content, these tools fail to fully communicate the content's graphic design information. Through semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiries, we identify the lack of this information and feedback as major challenges in understanding and editing layouts. Guided by these insights and a co-design process with a blind hobbyist web developer, we developed an interactive, multimodal authoring tool that lets blind people understand spatial relationships between elements and modify layout templates. Our tool automatically generates tactile print-outs of a web page's layout, which users overlay on top of a tablet that runs our self-voicing digital design tool. We conclude with design considerations grounded in user feedback for improving the accessibility of spatially encoded information and developing tools for BVI authors.","

The Effect of Stereo Display Deficiencies on Virtual Hand Pointing,"The limitations of stereo display systems affect depth perception, e.g., due to the vergence-accommodation conflict or diplopia. We performed three studies to understand how stereo display deficiencies impact 3D pointing for targets in front of a screen and close to the user, i.e., in peripersonal space. Our first two experiments compare movements with and without a change in visual depth for virtual respectively physical targets. Results indicate that selecting targets along the depth axis is slower and has less throughput for virtual targets, while physical pointing demonstrates the opposite result. We then propose a new 3D extension for Fitts' law that models the effect of stereo display deficiencies. Next, our third experiment verifies the model and measures more broadly how the change in visual depth between targets affects pointing performance in peripersonal space and confirms significant effects on time and throughput. Finally, we discuss implications for 3D user interface design.","Stereo display systems used in Augmented/Virtual Reality can affect depth perception, leading to slower and less accurate target selection in 3D space, especially when targets are close to the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300437,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Chatbots, Humbots, and the Quest for Artificial General Intelligence","What began as a quest for artificial general intelligence branched into several pursuits, including intelligent assistants developed by tech companies and task-oriented chatbots that deliver more information or services in specific domains. Progress quickened with the spread of low-latency networking, then accelerated dramatically a few years ago. In 2016, task-focused chatbots became a centerpiece of machine intelligence, promising interfaces that are more engaging than robotic answering systems and that can accommodate our increasingly phone-based information needs. Hundreds of thousands were built. Creating successful non-trivial chatbots proved more difficult than anticipated. Some developers now design for human-chatbot (humbot) teams, with people handling difficult queries. This paper describes the conversational agent space, difficulties in meeting user expectations, potential new design approaches, uses of human-bot hybrids, and implications for the ultimate goal of creating software with general intelligence.","
The rapid development and spread of voice assistants has led to a focus on task-oriented chatbots, which may not be able to handle complex or nuanced queries, leading to a potential decrease in the quality of customer service and user experience.

Haptic Navigation Cues on the Steering Wheel,"Haptic feedback is used in cars to reduce visual inattention. While tactile feedback like vibration can be influenced by the car's movement, thermal and cutaneous push feedback should be independent of such interference. This paper presents two driving simulator studies investigating novel tactile feedback on the steering wheel for navigation. First, devices on one side of the steering wheel were warmed, indicating the turning direction, while those on the other side were cooled. This thermal feedback was compared to audio. The thermal navigation lead to 94.2% correct recognitions of warnings 200m before the turn and to 91.7% correct turns. Speech had perfect recognition for both. In the second experiment, only the destination side was indicated thermally, and this design was compared to cutaneous push feedback. The simplified thermal feedback design did not increase recognition, but cutaneous push feedback had high recognition rates (100% for 200 m warnings, 98% for turns).","

Drag:on: A Virtual Reality Controller Providing Haptic Feedback Based on Drag and Weight Shift,"Standard controllers for virtual reality (VR) lack sophisticated means to convey a realistic, kinesthetic impression of size, resistance or inertia. We present the concept and implementation of Drag:on, an ungrounded shape-changing VR controller that provides dynamic passive haptic feedback based on drag, i.e. air resistance, and weight shift. Drag:on leverages the airflow occurring at the controller during interaction. By dynamically adjusting its surface area, the controller changes the drag and rotational inertia felt by the user. In a user study, we found that Drag:on can provide distinguishable levels of haptic feedback. Our prototype increases the haptic realism in VR compared to standard controllers and when rotated or swung improves the perception of virtual resistance. By this, Drag:on provides haptic feedback suitable for rendering different virtual mechanical resistances, virtual gas streams, and virtual objects differing in scale, material and fill state.","

The use of ungrounded shape-changing VR controllers like Drag:on may lead to a decrease in the user's perception of realism in virtual reality. The dynamic passive haptic feedback provided by the controller may create a disconnect between the user's physical movements and the virtual environment, potentially causing confusion or disorientation. Additionally, the reliance on airflow to generate haptic feedback may result in inconsistent feedback, as the air resistance may vary depending on the environment and the user's movements. This could lead to a less immersive experience for the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300441,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Socio-technical Dynamics: Cooperation of Emergent and Established Organisations in Crises and Disasters,"Increasing ubiquitousness of information and communication technology exerts influence on crisis and disaster management. New media enable citizens to rapidly self-organise in emergent groups. Theoretical framing of their interactions with established organisations is lacking. To address this, we conduct a thematic analysis on qualitative data from the European migration crisis of 2015. We draw on context-rich material from both emergent groups and established organisation. To represent our findings, we introduce the notion of socio-technical dynamics. We derive implications for computer supported cooperative work in crises and disasters. These insights contribute to the efficient involvement of emergent groups in established systems.","
Social media can create emergent groups that lack organization and structure, leading to inefficient and potentially harmful responses to crises and disasters.

On the Shoulder of the Giant: A Multi-Scale Mixed Reality Collaboration with 360 Video Sharing and Tangible Interaction,"We propose a multi-scale Mixed Reality (MR) collaboration between the Giant, a local Augmented Reality user, and the Miniature, a remote Virtual Reality user, in Giant-Miniature Collaboration (GMC). The Miniature is immersed in a 360-video shared by the Giant who can physically manipulate the Miniature through a tangible interface, a combined 360-camera with a 6 DOF tracker. We implemented a prototype system as a proof of concept and conducted a user study (n=24) comprising of four parts comparing: A) two types of virtual representations, B) three levels of Miniature control, C) three levels of 360-video view dependencies, and D) four 360-camera placement positions on the Giant. The results show users prefer a shoulder mounted camera view, while a view frustum with a complimentary avatar is a good visualization for the Miniature virtual representation. From the results, we give design recommendations and demonstrate an example Giant-Miniature Interaction.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology in Giant-Miniature Collaboration (GMC) could lead to a lack of physical interaction and social skills development between the Giant and Miniature users. The Miniature user may become overly reliant on the technology and neglect face-to-face interactions, leading to negative impacts on their mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, the Giant user may become desensitized to the physical world and neglect their surroundings, leading to potential accidents or injuries.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300458,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"""I feel it is my responsibility to stream"": Streaming and Engaging with Intangible Cultural Heritage through Livestreaming","Globalization has led to the destruction of many cultural practices, expressions, and knowledge found within local communities. These practices, defined by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), have been identified, promoted, and safeguarded by nations, academia, organizations and local communities to varying degrees. Despite such efforts, many practices are still in danger of being lost or forgotten forever. With the increased popularity of livestreaming in China, some streamers have begun to use livestreaming to showcase and promote ICH activities. To better understand the practices, opportunities, and challenges inherent in sharing and safeguarding ICH through livestreaming, we interviewed 10 streamers and 8 viewers from China. Through our qualitative investigation, we found that ICH streamers had altruistic motivations and engaged with viewers using multiple modalities beyond livestreams. We also found that livestreaming encouraged real-time interaction and sociality, while non-live curated videos attracted attention from a broader audience and assisted in the archiving of knowledge.","

Multi-Modal Approaches for Post-Editing Machine Translation,"Current advances in machine translation increase the need for translators to switch from traditional translation to post-editing (PE) of machine-translated text, a process that saves time and improves quality. This affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Our results of an elicitation study with professional translators indicate that a combination of pen, touch, and speech could well support common PE tasks, and received high subjective ratings by our participants. Therefore, we argue that future translation environment research should focus more strongly on these modalities in addition to mouse- and keyboard-based approaches. On the other hand, eye tracking and gesture modalities seem less important. An additional interview regarding interface design revealed that most translators would also see value in automatically receiving additional resources when a high cognitive load is detected during PE.","

"""What's Happening at that Hip?"": Evaluating an On-body Projection based Augmented Reality System for Physiotherapy Classroom","We present two studies to discuss the design, usability analysis, and educational outcome resulting from our system Augmented Body in physiotherapy classroom. We build on prior user-centric design work that investigates existing teaching methods and discuss opportunities for intervention. We present the design and implementation of a hybrid system for physiotherapy education combining an on-body projection based virtual anatomy supplemented by pen-based tablets to create real-time annotations. We conducted a usability evaluation of this system, comparing with projection only and traditional teaching conditions. Finally, we focus on a comparative study to evaluate learning outcome among students in actual classroom settings.

Bring the Outside In: Providing Accessible Experiences Through VR for People with Dementia in Locked Psychiatric Hospitals,"Many people with dementia (PWD) residing in long-term care may face barriers in accessing experiences beyond their physical premises; this may be due to location, mobility constraints, legal mental health act restrictions, or offence-related restrictions. In recent years, there have been research interests towards designing non-pharmacological interventions aiming to improve the Quality of Life (QoL) for PWD within long-term care. We explored the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a tool to provide 360°-video based experiences for individuals with moderate to severe dementia residing in a locked psychiatric hospital. We discuss at depth the appeal of using VR for PWD, and the observed impact of such interaction. We also present the design opportunities, pitfalls, and recommendations for future deployment in healthcare services. This paper demonstrates the potential of VR as a virtual alternative to experiences that may be difficult to reach for PWD residing within locked setting.","

AI-Mediated Communication: How the Perception that Profile Text was Written by AI Affects Trustworthiness,"We are entering an era of AI-Mediated Communication (AI-MC) where interpersonal communication is not only mediated by technology, but is optimized, augmented, or generated by artificial intelligence. Our study takes a first look at the potential impact of AI-MC on online self-presentation. In three experiments we test whether people find Airbnb hosts less trustworthy if they believe their profiles have been written by AI. We observe a new phenomenon that we term the Replicant Effect: Only when participants thought they saw a mixed set of AI- and human-written profiles, they mistrusted hosts whose profiles were labeled as or suspected to be written by AI. Our findings have implications for the design of systems that involve AI technologies in online self-presentation and chart a direction for future work that may upend or augment key aspects of Computer-Mediated Communication theory.","People may mistrust others online if they suspect AI wrote their profile, leading to potential miscommunication and missed connections.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300469,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Communication Breakdowns Between Families and Alexa,"We investigate how families repair communication breakdowns with digital home assistants. We recruited 10 diverse families to use an Amazon Echo Dot in their homes for four weeks. All families had at least one child between four and 17 years old. Each family participated in pre- and post- deployment interviews. Their interactions with the Echo Dot (Alexa) were audio recorded throughout the study. We analyzed 59 communication breakdown interactions between family members and Alexa, framing our analysis with concepts from HCI and speech-language pathology. Our findings indicate that family members collaborate using discourse scaffolding (supportive communication guidance) and a variety of speech and language modifications in their attempts to repair communication breakdowns with Alexa. Alexa's responses also influence the repair strategies that families use. Designers can relieve the communication repair burden that primarily rests with families by increasing digital home assistants' abilities to collaborate together with users to repair communication breakdowns.","

The study found that families have to put in extra effort to repair communication breakdowns with digital home assistants like Alexa, using various speech and language modifications. This means that the technology is not yet advanced enough to fully understand and respond to human communication, placing a burden on users to adapt to the technology's limitations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300473,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Examining and Enhancing the Illusory Touch Perception in Virtual Reality Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation,"Virtual reality (VR) can be immersive to such a degree that users sometimes report feeling tactile sensations based on visualization of the touch, without any actual physical contact. This effect is not only interesting for studies of human perception, but can also be leveraged to improve the quality of VR by evoking tactile sensations without usage of specialized equipment. The aim of this paper is to study brain processing of the illusory touch and its enhancement for purposes of exploitation in VR scene design. To amplify the illusory touch, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography (EEG), that allowed us to examine stimulation-induced changes in processing of the illusory touch in the brain, as well as to identify its neural correlates. Results confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation, and some of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.","Users may become so immersed in virtual reality that they experience tactile sensations without actual physical contact, potentially leading to a blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy. This could result in a decrease in ability to perceive and interact with the real world, and an increase in reliance on virtual environments.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300477,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Crowdsourcing Interface Feature Design with Bayesian Optimization,"Designing novel interfaces is challenging. Designers typically rely on experience or subjective judgment in the absence of analytical or objective means for selecting interface parameters. We demonstrate Bayesian optimization as an efficient tool for objective interface feature refinement. Specifically, we show that crowdsourcing paired with Bayesian optimization can rapidly and effectively assist interface design across diverse deployment environments. Experiment 1 evaluates the approach on a familiar 2D interface design problem: a map search and review use case. Adding a degree of complexity, Experiment 2 extends Experiment 1 by switching the deployment environment to mobile-based virtual reality. The approach is then demonstrated as a case study for a fundamentally new and unfamiliar interaction design problem: web-based augmented reality. Finally, we show how the model generated as an outcome of the refinement process can be used for user simulation and queried to deliver various design insights.","

The use of Bayesian optimization for interface design in virtual and augmented reality can lead to a loss of creativity and originality in design, as it relies on data-driven decision making rather than human intuition and creativity. This could result in a homogenization of design across different deployment environments, leading to a lack of diversity and innovation in the field. Additionally, the reliance on data-driven design may also lead to a lack of consideration for ethical and social implications of the technology, potentially perpetuating existing biases and inequalities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300482,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
"Hey Google, Can I Ask You Something in Private?","MModern day voice-activated virtual assistants allow users to share and ask for information that could be considered as personal through different input modalities and devices. Using Google Assistant, this study examined if the differences in modality (i.e., voice vs. text) and device (i.e., smartphone vs. smart home device) affect user perceptions when users attempt to retrieve sensitive health information from voice assistants. Major findings from this study suggest that voice (vs. text) interaction significantly enhanced perceived social presence of the voice assistant, but only when the users solicited less sensitive health-related information. Furthermore, when individuals reported less privacy concerns, voice (vs. text) interaction elicited positive attitudes toward the voice assistant via increased social presence, but only in the low (vs. high) information sensitivity condition. Contrary to modality, the device difference did not exert any significant impact on the attitudes toward the voice assistant regardless of the sensitivity level of the health information being asked or the level of individuals' privacy concerns.","Voice Assistants can make users feel more comfortable sharing personal information, potentially leading to privacy concerns.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300488,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Influencers in Multiplayer Online Shooters: Evidence of Social Contagion in Playtime and Social Play,"In a wide range of social networks, people's behavior is influenced by social contagion: we do what our network does. Networks often feature particularly influential individuals, commonly called ""influencers."" Existing work suggests that in-game social networks in online games are similar to real-life social networks in many respects. However, we do not know whether there are in-game equivalents to influencers. We therefore applied standard social network features used to identify influencers to the online multiplayer shooter Tom Clancy's The Division. Results show that network feature-defined influencers had indeed an outsized impact on playtime and social play of players joining their in-game network.","Social media platforms can create a false sense of reality and influence people's behavior in negative ways, such as excessive screen time and social comparison.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300489,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
An Exploration of Speech-Based Productivity Support in the Car,"In-car intelligent assistants offer the opportunity to help drivers productively use previously unclaimed time during their commute. However, engaging in secondary tasks can reduce attention on driving and thus may affect road safety. Any interface used while driving, even if speech-based, cannot consider non-driving tasks in isolation of driving---alerts for safer driving and timing of the non-driving tasks are crucial to maintaining safety. In this work, we explore experiences with a speech-based assistant that attempts to help drivers safely complete complex productivity tasks. Via a controlled simulator study, we look at how level of support and road context alerts from the assistant influence a driver's ability to drive safely while writing a document or creating slides via speech. Our results suggest ways to support speech-based productivity interactions and how speech-based road context alerts may influence driver behavior.",Voice Assistant technology may reduce attention on driving and affect road safety.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300494,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Everyday Experiences: Small Stories and Mental Illness on Instagram,"Despite historical precedence and modern prevalence, mental illness and associated disorders are frequently aligned with notions of deviance and, by association, abnormality. The view that mental illness deviates from an implicit social norm permeates the CHI community, impacting how scholars approach research in this space. In this paper, we challenge community and societal norms aligning mental illness with deviance. We combine semi-structured interviews with digital ethnography of public Instagram accounts to examine how Instagram users express mental illness. Drawing on small stories research, we find that individuals situate mental illness within their everyday lives and negotiate their tellings of experience due to the influence of various social control structures. We discuss implications for incorporating 'the everyday' into the design of technological solutions for marginalized communities and the ways in which researchers and designers may inadvertently perpetuate and instantiate stigma related to mental illness.",Social Media platforms like Instagram can perpetuate stigma and marginalization of people with mental illnesses by reinforcing societal norms and expectations of deviance.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300495,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Risk vs. Restriction: The Tension between Providing a Sense of Normalcy and Keeping Foster Teens Safe Online,"Foster youth are particularly vulnerable to offline risks; yet, little is known about their online risk experiences or how foster parents mediate technology use in the home. We conducted 29 interviews with foster parents of 42 teens (ages 13-17) who were part of the child welfare system. Foster parents faced significant challenges relating to technology mediation in the home. Based on parental accounts, over half of the foster teens encountered high-risk situations that involved interacting with unsafe people online, resulting in rape, sex trafficking, and/or psychological harm. Overall, foster parents were at a loss for how to balance online safety with technology access in a way that engendered positive relationships with their foster teens. Instead, parents often resorted to outright restriction. Our research highlights the importance of considering the unique needs of foster families and designing technologies to address the challenges faced by this vulnerable population of teens and parents.","Foster teens are at high risk of encountering dangerous situations online, such as rape, sex trafficking, and psychological harm, due to a lack of effective mediation and balanced access to technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300497,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Clench Interface: Novel Biting Input Techniques,"People eat every day and biting is one of the most fundamental and natural actions that they perform on a daily basis. Existing work has explored tooth click location and jaw movement as input techniques, however clenching has the potential to add control to this input channel. We propose clench interaction that leverages clenching as an actively controlled physiological signal that can facilitate interactions. We conducted a user study to investigate users' ability to control their clench force. We found that users can easily discriminate three force levels, and that they can quickly confirm actions by unclenching (quick release). We developed a design space for clench interaction based on the results and investigated the usability of the clench interface. Participants preferred the clench over baselines and indicated a willingness to use clench-based interactions. This novel technique can provide an additional input method in cases where users' eyes or hands are busy, augment immersive experiences such as virtual/augmented reality, and assist individuals with disabilities.","

Exploring Virtual Agents for Augmented Reality,"Prior work has shown that embodiment can benefit virtual agents, such as increasing rapport and conveying non-verbal information. However, it is unclear if users prefer an embodied to a speech-only agent for augmented reality (AR) headsets that are designed to assist users in completing real-world tasks. We conducted a study to examine users' perceptions and behaviors when interacting with virtual agents in AR. We asked 24 adults to wear the Microsoft HoloLens and find objects in a hidden object game while interacting with an agent that would offer assistance. We presented participants with four different agents: voice-only, non-human, full-size embodied, and a miniature embodied agent. Overall, users preferred the miniature embodied agent due to the novelty of his size and reduced uncanniness as opposed to the larger agent. From our results, we draw conclusions about how agent representation matters and derive guidelines on designing agents for AR headsets.","

The study found that users preferred a miniature embodied agent over a full-size embodied agent, suggesting that people may be more comfortable with smaller, less human-like virtual assistants. This could lead to a decrease in the use of human-like virtual agents, which could have negative consequences for tasks that require human-like interaction, such as building rapport or conveying non-verbal information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300511,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Can Mobile Augmented Reality Stimulate a Honeypot Effect?: Observations from Santa's Lil Helper,"In HCI, the honeypot effect describes a form of audience engagement in which a person's interaction with a technology stimulates passers-by to observe, approach and engage in an interaction themselves. In this paper we explore the potential for honeypot effects to arise in the use of mobile augmented reality (AR) applications in urban spaces. We present an observational study of Santa's Lil Helper, a mobile AR game that created a Christmas-themed treasure hunt in a metropolitan area. Our study supports a consideration of three factors that may impede the honeypot effect: the presence of people in relation to the game and its interactive components; the visibility of gameplay in urban space; and the extent to which the game permits a shared experience.

A Place to Play: The (Dis)Abled Embodied Experience for Autistic Children in Online Spaces,"Play is the work of children-but access to play is not equal from child to child. Having access to a place to play is a challenge for marginalized children, such as children with disabilities. For autistic children, playing with other children in the physical world may be uncomfortable or even painful. Yet, having practice in the social skills play provides is essential for childhood development. In this ethnographic work, I explore how one community uses the sense of place and the digital embodied experience in a virtual world specifically to give autistic children access to play with their peers. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, I demonstrate how various physical and virtual spaces work together to make play possible. Second, I demonstrate these spaces, though some of them are digital, are no more or less ""real"" than the physical spaces making up a schoolyard or playground.","Inequality in access to play for marginalized children, such as those with disabilities, as they may not have the same opportunities for social skills development as their peers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300518,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Effects of Locomotion and Visual Overview on Spatial Memory when Interacting with Wall Displays,"Wall displays support people in interacting with large information spaces in two ways: On the one hand, the physical space in front of such displays enables them to navigate information spaces physically. On the other hand, the visual overview of the information space on the display may promote the formation of spatial memory; from studies of desktop computers we know this can boost performance. However, it remains unclear how the benefits of locomotion and overviews relate and whether one is more important than the other. We study this question through a wall display adaptation of the classic Data Mountain system to separate the effects of locomotion and visual overview. Our findings suggest that overview improves recall and that the combination of overview and locomotion outperforms all other combinations of factors.",Over-reliance on technology may lead to decreased spatial memory and problem-solving skills.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300521,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being

Social Media TestDrive: Real-World Social Media Education for the Next Generation,"Social media sites are where life happens for many of today's young people, so it is important to teach them to use these sites safely and effectively. Many youth receive classroom education on digital literacy topics, but have few chances to build actual skills. Social Media TestDrive, an interactive social media simulation, fills a gap in digital literacy education by combining experiential learning in a realistic and safe social media environment with educator-facilitated classroom lessons. The tool was piloted with 12 educators and over 200 students, and formative evaluation data suggest that TestDrive achieved high levels of engagement with both groups. Students reported the modules enhanced their understanding of digital citizenship issues, and educators noted that students were engaging in meaningful classroom conversations. Finally, we discuss the importance of involving multiple stakeholder groups (e.g., researchers, youth, educators, curriculum developers) in designing educational technology.","
Social media sites can pose a risk to young people's safety and well-being if they are not properly educated on how to use them safely and effectively.

Communicating Hurricane Risks: Multi-Method Examination of Risk Imagery Diffusion,"Conveying uncertainty in information artifacts is difficult; the challenge only grows as the demand for mass communication through multiple channels expands. In particular, as natural hazards increase with changing global conditions, including hurricanes which threaten coastal areas, we need better means of communicating uncertainty around risks that empower people to make good decisions. We examine how people share and respond to a range of visual representations of risk from authoritative sources during hurricane events. Because these images are now shared widely on social media platforms, Twitter provides the means to study them on a large scale as close to in vivo as possible. Using mixed methods, this study analyzes diffusion of and reactions to forecast and other risk imagery during the highly damaging 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to describe the collective response to visual representations of risk.","Social media platforms can spread misinformation and uncertainty during natural disasters, making it difficult for people to make informed decisions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300545,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Brick: Toward A Model for Designing Synchronous Colocated Augmented Reality Games,"Augmented reality (AR) games have been growing in popularity in recent years. However, current AR games offer limited opportunities for a synchronous multiplayer experience. This paper introduces a model for designing AR experiences in which players inhabit a shared, real-time augmented environment and can engage in synchronous and collaborative interactions with other players. We explored the development of this model through the creation of Brick, a two-player mobile AR game at the room scale. We refined Brick over multiple rounds of iteration, and we used our playtests to investigate a range of issues involved in designing shared-world AR games. Our findings suggest that there are five major categories of interactions in a shared-world AR system: single-player, intrapersonal, multiplayer, interpersonal, and environmental. We believe that this model can support the development of collaborative AR games and new forms of social gameplay.","

The development of shared-world AR games may lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and social skills, as players become more focused on their virtual environments and less engaged with the people around them. This could result in a loss of important social connections and a decrease in empathy and emotional intelligence. Additionally, the emphasis on multiplayer interactions may lead to an increase in cyberbullying and online harassment, as players may feel emboldened to engage in negative behavior towards others in the virtual environment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300553,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Scaptics and Highlight-Planes: Immersive Interaction Techniques for Finding Occluded Features in 3D Scatterplots,"Three-dimensional scatterplots suffer from well-known perception and usability problems. In particular, overplotting and occlusion, mainly due to density and noise, prevent users from properly perceiving the data. Thanks to accurate head and hand tracking, immersive Virtual Reality (VR) setups provide new ways to interact and navigate with 3D scatterplots. VR also supports additional sensory modalities such as haptic feedback. Inspired by methods commonly used in Scientific Visualisation to visually explore volumes, we propose two techniques that leverage the immersive aspects of VR: first, a density-based haptic vibration technique (Scaptics) which provides feedback through the controller; and second, an adaptation of a cutting plane for 3D scatterplots (Highlight-Plane). We evaluated both techniques in a controlled study with two tasks involving density (finding high- and low-density areas). Overall, Scaptics was the most time-efficient and accurate technique, however, in some conditions, it was outperformed by Highlight-Plane.","Overplotting and occlusion in 3D scatterplots can hinder users' ability to properly perceive data, leading to inefficiency and inaccuracy in tasks involving density.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300555,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Vocal Shortcuts for Creative Experts,"Vocal shortcuts, short spoken phrases to control interfaces, have the potential to reduce cognitive and physical costs of interactions. They may benefit expert users of creative applications (e.g., designers, illustrators) by helping them maintain creative focus. To aid the design of vocal shortcuts and gather use cases and design guidelines for speech interaction, we interviewed ten creative experts. Based on our findings, we built VoiceCuts, a prototype implementation of vocal shortcuts in the context of an existing creative application. In contrast to other speech interfaces, VoiceCuts targets experts' unique needs by handling short and partial commands and leverages document model and application context to disambiguate user utterances. We report on the viability and limitations of our approach based on feedback from creative experts.","

The use of voice assistants may lead to a reduction in cognitive abilities, as users become reliant on the technology to perform tasks that they would otherwise do themselves, potentially leading to a decline in mental sharpness and problem-solving skills.

Upside and Downside Risk in Online Security for Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,"Older adults are rapidly increasing their use of online services such as banking, social media, and email - services that come with subtle and serious security and privacy risks. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are particularly vulnerable to these risks because MCI can reduce their ability to recognize scams such as email phishing, follow recommended password guidelines, and consider the implications of sharing personal information. Older adults with MCI often cope with their impairments with the help of caregivers, including partners, children, and professional health personnel, when using and managing online services. Yet, this too carries security and privacy risks: sharing personal information with caregivers can create issues of agency, autonomy, and even risk embarrassment and information leakage; caregivers also do not always act in their charges' best interest. Through a series of interviews conducted in the US, we identify a spectrum of safeguarding strategies used and consider them through the lens of 'upside and downside risk' where there are tradeoffs between reduced privacy and maintaining older adults' autonomy and access to online services.","Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are vulnerable to security and privacy risks when using online services, and sharing personal information with caregivers can create issues of agency, autonomy, and risk embarrassment and information leakage.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300573,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
"Seekers, Providers, Welcomers, and Storytellers: Modeling Social Roles in Online Health Communities","Participants in online communities often enact different roles when participating in their communities. For example, some in cancer support communities specialize in providing disease-related information or socializing new members. This work clusters the behavioral patterns of users of a cancer support community into specific functional roles. Based on a series of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, this research identified eleven roles that members occupy, such as welcomer and story sharer. We investigated role dynamics, including how roles change over members' lifecycles, and how roles predict long-term participation in the community. We found that members frequently change roles over their history, from ones that seek resources to ones offering help, while the distribution of roles is stable over the community's history. Adopting certain roles early on predicts members' continued participation in the community. Our methodology will be useful for facilitating better use of members' skills and interests in support of community-building efforts.","Social Media technology can create a false sense of community and support, as people may feel like they are part of a community without actually forming meaningful connections or receiving adequate support.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300574,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Lost in Style: Gaze-driven Adaptive Aid for VR Navigation,"A key challenge for virtual reality level designers is striking a balance between maintaining the immersiveness of VR and providing users with on-screen aids after designing a virtual experience. These aids are often necessary for wayfinding in virtual environments with complex paths. We introduce a novel adaptive aid that maintains the effectiveness of traditional aids, while equipping designers and users with the controls of how often help is displayed. Our adaptive aid uses gaze patterns in predicting user's need for navigation aid in VR and displays mini-maps or arrows accordingly. Using a dataset of gaze angle sequences of users navigating a VR environment and markers of when users requested aid, we trained an LSTM to classify user's gaze sequences as needing navigation help and display an aid. We validated the efficacy of the adaptive aid for wayfinding compared to other commonly-used wayfinding aids.",Over-reliance on technology and loss of natural navigation skills.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300578,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"""If It's Important It Will Be A Headline"": Cybersecurity Information Seeking in Older Adults","Older adults are increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and scams. Yet we know relatively little about their understanding of cybersecurity, their information-seeking behaviours, and their trusted sources of information and advice in this domain. We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with community-dwelling older adults in order to explore their cybersecurity information seeking behaviours. Following a thematic analysis of these interviews, we developed a cybersecurity information access framework that highlights shortcomings in older adults' choice of information resources. Specifically, we find that older users prioritise social resources based on availability, rather than cybersecurity expertise, and that they avoid using the Internet for cybersecurity information searches despite using it for other domains. Finally, we discuss the design of cybersecurity information dissemination strategies for older users, incorporating favoured sources such as TV adverts and radio programming.",Older adults are more vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and scams due to their limited understanding of cybersecurity and their reliance on untrustworthy sources of information.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300579,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Engaging Lived and Virtual Realities,"We examined the integration of VR into informal and less-structured learning environments in Atlanta (USA) and Mumbai (India) through a process of co-design, co-creation, and co-learning with students and teachers where students learned to use VR to engage with their economic, social, and cultural realities. Using qualitative methods, we engaged students and teachers at both sites in VR content creation activities; through these activities, we attempt to uncover a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities of introducing low-cost mobile VR for content generation, consumption, and sharing in underserved learning contexts. We also motivate future work that looks at integrating VR in new contexts, using flexible methods, across borders. The larger vision of our research is to advance us towards greater accessibility and inclusivity of VR across diverse learning environments.","

The integration of VR in informal and less-structured learning environments may widen the gap between underserved and privileged students, as the former may not have access to the technology or the skills to use it effectively.

"""I was really, really nervous posting it"": Communicating about Invisible Chronic Illnesses across Social Media Platforms","People with invisible chronic illnesses (ICIs) can use social media to seek both informational and emotional support, but these individuals also face social and health-related challenges in posting about their often-stigmatized conditions online. To understand how they evaluate different platforms for disclosure, we interviewed 19 people with ICIs who post on general social media about their illnesses, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. We present a cross-platform analysis of how platforms varied in their suitability to achieve participants' goals, as well as the challenges posed by each platform. We also found that as participants' ICIs progressed, their goals, challenges, and social media use similarly evolved over time. Our findings highlight how people with ICIs select platforms from a broader ecology of social media and suggest a general need to understand shifts in social media use for populations with chronic but changing health concerns.",Social media platforms may not be suitable for people with invisible chronic illnesses (ICIs) to seek support and disclose their conditions due to stigma and challenges in achieving their goals.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300583,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Beyond The Force: Using Quadcopters to Appropriate Objects and the Environment for Haptics in Virtual Reality,"Quadcopters have been used as hovering encountered-type haptic devices in virtual reality. We suggest that quadcopters can facilitate rich haptic interactions beyond force feedback by appropriating physical objects and the environment. We present HoverHaptics, an autonomous safe-to-touch quadcopter and its integration with a virtual shopping experience. HoverHaptics highlights three affordances of quadcopters that enable these rich haptic interactions: (1) dynamic positioning of passive haptics, (2) texture mapping, and (3) animating passive props. We identify inherent challenges of hovering encountered-type haptic devices, such as their limited speed, inadequate control accuracy, and safety concerns. We then detail our approach for tackling these challenges, including the use of display techniques, visuo-haptic illusions, and collision avoidance. We conclude by describing a preliminary study (n = 9) to better understand the subjective user experience when interacting with a quadcopter in virtual reality using these techniques.","

The use of quadcopters in virtual reality can create safety concerns, such as the risk of collision or injury, and may also be limited by their speed and control accuracy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300589,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Using Presence Questionnaires in Virtual Reality,"Virtual Reality (VR) is gaining increasing importance in science, education, and entertainment. A fundamental characteristic of VR is creating presence, the experience of 'being' or 'acting', when physically situated in another place. Measuring presence is vital for VR research and development. It is typically repeatedly assessed through questionnaires completed after leaving a VR scene. Requiring participants to leave and re-enter the VR costs time and can cause disorientation. In this paper, we investigate the effect of completing presence questionnaires directly in VR. Thirty-six participants experienced two immersion levels and filled three standardized presence questionnaires in the real world or VR. We found no effect on the questionnaires' mean scores; however, we found that the variance of those measures significantly depends on the realism of the virtual scene and if the subjects had left the VR. The results indicate that, besides reducing a study's duration and reducing disorientation, completing questionnaires in VR does not change the measured presence but can increase the consistency of the variance.","

The use of Virtual Reality technology can lead to disorientation and increased time costs when participants are required to leave and re-enter the VR scene, potentially affecting the accuracy of presence questionnaires.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300590,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Can Privacy Be Satisfying?: On Improving Viewer Satisfaction for Privacy-Enhanced Photos Using Aesthetic Transforms,"Pervasive photo sharing in online social media platforms can cause unintended privacy violations when elements of an image reveal sensitive information. Prior studies have identified image obfuscation methods (e.g., blurring) to enhance privacy, but many of these methods adversely affect viewers' satisfaction with the photo, which may cause people to avoid using them. In this paper, we study the novel hypothesis that it may be possible to restore viewers' satisfaction by 'boosting' or enhancing the aesthetics of an obscured image, thereby compensating for the negative effects of a privacy transform. Using a between-subjects online experiment, we studied the effects of three artistic transformations on images that had objects obscured using three popular obfuscation methods validated by prior research. Our findings suggest that using artistic transformations can mitigate some negative effects of obfuscation methods, but more exploration is needed to retain viewer satisfaction.",Privacy violations due to sharing of images on social media platforms.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300597,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Examining Augmented Virtuality Impairment Simulation for Mobile App Accessibility Design,"With mobile apps rapidly permeating all aspects of daily living with use by all segments of the population, it is crucial to support the evaluation of app usability for specific impaired users to improve app accessibility. In this work, we examine the effects of using our augmented virtuality impairment simulation system--Empath-D--to support experienced designer-developers to redesign a mockup of commonly used mobile application for cataract-impaired users, comparing this with existing tools that aid designing for accessibility. We show that the use of augmented virtuality for assessing usability supports enhanced usability challenge identification, finding more defects and doing so more accurately than with existing methods. Through our user interviews, we also show that augmented virtuality impairment simulation supports realistic interaction and evaluation to provide a concrete understanding over the usability challenges that impaired users face, and complements the existing guidelines-based approaches meant for general accessibility.","

Voice User Interfaces in Schools: Co-designing for Inclusion with Visually-Impaired and Sighted Pupils,"Voice user interfaces (VUIs) are increasingly popular, particularly in homes. However, little research has investigated their potential in other settings, such as schools. We investigated how VUIs could support inclusive education, particularly for pupils with visual impairments (VIs). We organised focused discussions with educators at a school, with support staff from local authorities and, through bodystorming, with a class of 27 pupils. We then ran a series of co-design workshops with participants with mixed-visual abilities to design an educational VUI application. This provided insights into challenges faced by pupils with VIs in mainstream schools, and opened a space for educators, sighted and visually impaired pupils to reflect on and design for their shared learning experiences through VUIs. We present scenarios, a design space and an example application that show novel ways of using VUIs for inclusive education. We also reflect on co-designing with mixed-visual-ability groups in this space.","

The article highlights the potential of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) to support inclusive education, particularly for pupils with visual impairments. However, the research also reveals that there are challenges faced by pupils with visual impairments in mainstream schools, which VUIs may not fully address. For example, the article mentions that VUIs may not be able to provide the same level of accessibility as braille or large print materials, which are essential for some pupils with visual impairments. Additionally, the article notes that VUIs may not be able to fully replace the need for human support staff, such as teachers or assistants, who are essential for providing individualized support to pupils with visual impairments. Therefore, while VUIs have the potential to support inclusive education, they are not a replacement for human support and other accessibility tools.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300608,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
Barriers to End-User Designers of Augmented Fabrication,"Augmented fabrication is the practice of designing and fabricating an artifact to work with existing objects. Although common both in the wild and as an area for research tools, little is known about how novices approach the task of designing under the constraints of interfacing with real-world objects. In this paper, we report the results of a study of fifteen novice end users in an augmented fabrication design task. We discuss obstacles encountered in four contexts: capturing information about physical objects, transferring information to 3D~modeling software, digitally modeling a new object, and evaluating whether the new object will work when fabricated. Based on our findings, we suggest how future tools can better support augmented fabrication in each of these contexts.","

The study found that novice users encountered several obstacles when designing objects using augmented fabrication, including capturing information about physical objects, transferring information to 3D modeling software, digitally modeling a new object, and evaluating whether the new object will work when fabricated. These obstacles can lead to frustration and difficulty in creating successful designs, which may discourage people from using the technology. Additionally, the technology may not be accessible to those who are not tech-savvy, further exacerbating existing social inequalities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300613,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Frame Analysis of Voice Interaction Gameplay,"Voice control is an increasingly common feature of digital games, but the experience of playing with voice control is often hampered by feelings of embarrassment and dissonance. Past research has recognised these tensions, but has not offered a general model of how they arise and how players respond to them. In this study, we use Erving Goffman's frame analysis, as adapted to the study of games by Conway and Trevillian, to understand the social experience of playing games by voice. Based on 24 interviews with participants who played voice-controlled games in a social setting, we put forward a frame analytic model of gameplay as a social event, along with seven themes that describe how voice interaction enhances or disrupts the player experience. Our results demonstrate the utility of frame analysis for understanding social dissonance in voice interaction gameplay, and point to practical considerations for designers to improve engagement with voice-controlled games.","Embarrassment and dissonance when using voice control in digital games, leading to disrupted player experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300623,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Affinity Lens: Data-Assisted Affinity Diagramming with Augmented Reality,"Despite the availability of software to support Affinity Diagramming (AD), practitioners still largely favor physical sticky-notes. Physical notes are easy to set-up, can be moved around in space and offer flexibility when clustering un-structured data. However, when working with mixed data sources such as surveys, designers often trade off the physicality of notes for analytical power. We propose AffinityLens, a mobile-based augmented reality (AR) application for Data-Assisted Affinity Diagramming (DAAD). Our application provides just-in-time quantitative insights overlaid on physical notes. Affinity Lens uses several different types of AR overlays (called lenses) to help users find specific notes, cluster information, and summarize insights from clusters. Through a formative study of AD users, we developed design principles for data-assisted AD and an initial collection of lenses. Based on our prototype, we find that Affinity Lens supports easy switching between qualitative and quantitative 'views' of data, without surrendering the lightweight benefits of existing AD practice.","

The use of Augmented Reality technology in Affinity Diagramming may lead to a reliance on technology and a decrease in the use of physical sticky-notes, which can hinder the creative process and flexibility when clustering un-structured data.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300628,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Voice-Based Quizzes for Measuring Knowledge Retention in Under-Connected Populations,"Information dissemination using automated phone calls allows reaching low-literate and tech-naive populations. Open challenges include rapid verification of expected knowledge gaps in the community, dissemination of specific information to address these gaps, and follow-up measurement of knowledge retention. We report Sawaal, a voice-based telephone service that uses audio-quizzes to address these challenges. Sawaal allows its open community of users to post and attempt multiple-choice questions and to vote and comment on them. Sawaal spreads virally as users challenge friends to quiz competitions. Administrator-posted questions allow confirming specific knowledge gaps, spreading correct information and measuring knowledge retention via rephrased, repeated questions. In 14 weeks and with no advertisement, Sawaal reached 3,433 users (120,119 calls) in Pakistan, who contributed 13,276 questions that were attempted 455,158 times by 2,027 users. Knowledge retention remained significant for up to two weeks. Surveys revealed that 71% of the mostly low-literate, young, male users were blind.","

Exploring Interaction Fidelity in Virtual Reality: Object Manipulation and Whole-Body Movements,"High degrees of interaction fidelity (IF) in virtual reality (VR) are said to improve user experience and immersion, but there is also evidence of low IF providing comparable experiences. VR games are now increasingly prevalent, yet we still do not fully understand the trade-off between realism and abstraction in this context. We conducted a lab study comparing high and low IF for object manipulation tasks in a VR game. In a second study, we investigated players' experiences of IF for whole-body movements in a VR game that allowed players to crawl underneath virtual boulders and ""dangle'' along monkey bars. Our findings show that high IF is preferred for object manipulation, but for whole-body movements, moderate IF can suffice, as there is a trade-off with usability and social factors. We provide guidelines for the development of VR games based on our results.","Overemphasis on realism in virtual reality can lead to a trade-off with usability and social factors, potentially hindering the overall user experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300644,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Detecting Visuo-Haptic Mismatches in Virtual Reality using the Prediction Error Negativity of Event-Related Brain Potentials,"Designing immersion is the key challenge in virtual reality; this challenge has driven advancements in displays, rendering and recently, haptics. To increase our sense of physical immersion, for instance, vibrotactile gloves render the sense of touching, while electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) renders forces. Unfortunately, the established metric to assess the effectiveness of haptic devices relies on the user's subjective interpretation of unspecific, yet standardized, questions. Here, we explore a new approach to detect a conflict in visuo-haptic integration (e.g., inadequate haptic feedback based on poorly configured collision detection) using electroencephalography (EEG). We propose analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) during interaction with virtual objects. In our study, participants touched virtual objects in three conditions and received either no haptic feedback, vibration, or vibration and EMS feedback. To provoke a brain response in unrealistic VR interaction, we also presented the feedback prematurely in 25% of the trials. We found that the early negativity component of the ERP (so called prediction error) was more pronounced in the mismatch trials, indicating we successfully detected haptic conflicts using our technique. Our results are a first step towards using ERPs to automatically detect visuo-haptic mismatches in VR, such as those that can cause a loss of the user's immersion.",Loss of user's immersion due to visuo-haptic mismatches in VR.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300657,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Social Play in an Exergame: How the Need to Belong Predicts Adherence,"The general trend in exercise interventions, including those based on exergames, is to see high initial enthusiasm but significantly declining adherence. Social play is considered a core tenet of the design of exercise interventions help foster motivation to play. To determine whether social play aids in adherence to exergames, we analyzed data from a study involving five waves of six-week exergame trials between a single-player and multiplayer group. In this paper, we examine the multiplayer group to determine who might benefit from social play and why. We found that people who primarily engage in group play have superior adherence to people who primarily play alone. People who play alone in a multiplayer exergame have worse adherence than playing a single-player version, which can undo any potential benefit of social play. The primary construct distinguishing group versus alone players is their sense of program belonging. Program belonging is, thus, crucial to multiplayer exergame design.","People who primarily engage in group play in multiplayer exergames have better adherence compared to those who play alone, but those who play alone in a multiplayer exergame have worse adherence than playing a single-player version, potentially undoing any benefits of social play.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300660,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Older Voices: Supporting Community Radio Production for Civic Participation in Later Life,"Community radio can support the process of having a voice in one's community as a part of civic action, and promote community dialogue. However, older adults are underrepresented as producers of community radio shows in the UK, and face different challenges to their younger colleagues. By working within the radio production group of an existing organisation of older adults, we identify the motivations and challenges in supporting this type of civic participation in media in later life. Key challenges were identified, including audience engagement, content persistence and process sustainability. In response, we 1) supported the group's audience engagement using Facebook Live and a phone-in option, and 2) developed a digital production tool. Reporting on the continued use of the tool by the organisation, we discuss how tailored and non-intrusive processes mediated by digital technology can support older adults in delivering richer media experiences whilst serving their civic participatory interests.","

Quantitative Measurement of Tool Embodiment for Virtual Reality Input Alternatives,"Virtual reality (VR) strives to replicate the sensation of the physical environment by mimicking people's perceptions and experience of being elsewhere. These experiences are of-ten mediated by the objects and tools we interact with in the virtual world (e.g., a controller). Evidence from psychology posits that when using the tool proficiently, it becomes em-bodied (i.e., an extension of one's body). There is little work,however, on how to measure this phenomenon in VR, andon how different types of tools and controllers can affect the experience of interaction. In this work, we leverage cognitive psychology and philosophy literature to construct the Locus-of-Attention Index (LAI), a measure of tool embodiment. We designed and conducted a study that measures readiness-to-hand and unreadiness-to-hand for three VR interaction techniques: hands, a physical tool, and a VR controller. The study shows that LAI can measure differences in embodiment with working and broken tools and that using the hand directly results in more embodiment than using controllers.","

Augmented Reality Views for Occluded Interaction,"We rely on our sight when manipulating objects. When objects are occluded, manipulation becomes difficult. Such occluded objects can be shown via augmented reality to re-enable visual guidance. However, it is unclear how to do so to best support object manipulation. We compare four views of occluded objects and their effect on performance and satisfaction across a set of everyday manipulation tasks of varying complexity. The best performing views were a see-through view and a displaced 3D view. The former enabled participants to observe the manipulated object through the occluder, while the latter showed the 3D view of the manipulated object offset from the object's real location. The worst performing view showed remote imagery from a simulated hand-mounted camera. Our results suggest that alignment of virtual objects with their real-world location is less important than an appropriate point-of-view and view stability.","

Beyond Tutoring: Opportunities for Intergenerational Mentorship at a Community Level,"Community intergenerational mentorship offers an opportunity to address older adults' social isolation while providing valuable one-on-one or small group learning experiences for elementary school students. Current organizations that support this kind of engagement focus on in-person visits that place the burden of logistics and transportation on the older adult. However, as older adults become less independent while aging, coming to schools in person becomes more challenging. We present a qualitative analysis of current intergenerational mentorship practices to understand opportunities for technology to expand access to this experience. We highlight elements critical for building successful mentorship: the importance of relationship building between older adults and children during mentoring activities, the skills mentors acquired to carry out mentoring activities, and support needed from teachers and schools. We contribute a rich description of current intergenerational mentorship practices and provide insights for opportunities for novel HCI technologies in this context.","
Augmented/Virtual Reality technology may reduce the need for in-person interactions and potentially diminish the positive impact of intergenerational mentorship programs.

Beyond Dyadic Interactions: Considering Chatbots as Community Members,"Chatbots have grown as a space for research and development in recent years due both to the realization of their commercial potential and to advancements in language processing that have facilitated more natural conversations. However, nearly all chatbots to date have been designed for dyadic, one-on-one communication with users. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of research on chatbots supplemented by a review of commercial and independent chatbots. We argue that chatbots' social roles and conversational capabilities beyond dyadic interactions have been underexplored, and that expansion into this design space could support richer social interactions in online communities and help address the longstanding challenges of maintaining, moderating, and growing these communities. In order to identify opportunities beyond dyadic interactions, we used research-through-design methods to generate more than 400 concepts for new social chatbots, and we present seven categories that emerged from analysis of these ideas.","

Face and Ecological Validity in Simulations: Lessons from Search-and-Rescue HRI,"In fields where in situ performance cannot be measured, ecological validity is difficult to estimate.

Techies Against Facebook: Understanding Negative Sentiment Toward Facebook via User Generated Content,"Researchers have recognized the need to pay attention to negative aspects and non-use of social media services to uncover usage barriers and surface shortcomings of these systems. We contribute to these efforts by analyzing comments on posts related to Facebook on two blogs with a technically savvy readership: Slashdot and Schneier on Security. Our analysis indicates that technically savvy individuals exhibit notably large negative sentiment toward Facebook with nearly 45% of the 3,000 reader comments we coded expressing such views. Qualitative coding revealed Privacy and Security, User Experience, and Personal Disposition as key factors underlying the negative views. Our findings suggest that negative sentiment is an explicit higher level factor driving non-use practices. Further, we confirm several non-use practices reported in the literature and identify additional aspects connected to recent technological and societal developments. Our results demonstrate that analysis of user generated content can be useful for surfacing usage practices on a large scale.","Negative sentiment toward Facebook, including privacy and security concerns, poor user experience, and personal disposition, leading to non-use practices.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300698,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
What Makes a Good Conversation?: Challenges in Designing Truly Conversational Agents,"Conversational agents promise conversational interaction but fail to deliver. Efforts often emulate functional rules from human speech, without considering key characteristics that conversation must encapsulate. Given its potential in supporting long-term human-agent relationships, it is paramount that HCI focuses efforts on delivering this promise. We aim to understand what people value in conversation and how this should manifest in agents. Findings from a series of semi-structured interviews show people make a clear dichotomy between social and functional roles of conversation, emphasising the long-term dynamics of bond and trust along with the importance of context and relationship stage in the types of conversations they have. People fundamentally questioned the need for bond and common ground in agent communication, shifting to more utilitarian definitions of conversational qualities. Drawing on these findings we discuss key challenges for conversational agent design, most notably the need to redefine the design parameters for conversational agent interaction.","People may start to prefer shallow, functional conversations with voice assistants over deeper, more meaningful interactions with humans, leading to a decline in social skills and relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300705,Voice Assistant,CHI,social norms & relationship
Mind the Tap: Assessing Foot-Taps for Interacting with Head-Mounted Displays,"From voice commands and air taps to touch gestures on frames: Various techniques for interacting with head-mounted displays (HMDs) have been proposed. While these techniques have both benefits and drawbacks dependent on the current situation of the user, research on interacting with HMDs has not concluded yet. In this paper, we add to the body of research on interacting with HMDs by exploring foot-tapping as an input modality. Through two controlled experiments with a total of 36 participants, we first explore direct interaction with interfaces that are displayed on the floor and require the user to look down to interact. Secondly, we investigate indirect interaction with interfaces that, although operated by the user's feet, are always visible as they are floating in front of the user. Based on the results of the two experiments, we provide design recommendations for direct and indirect foot-based user interfaces.","

Our central finding is that the lived experience of menopause is social: menopause is less about bodily experiences by themselves and more about how experiences with the body become meaningful over time in the social context. We find that gendered marginalization shapes diverse social relationships, leading to widespread feelings of alienation and negative transformation - often expressed in semantically dense figurative language. Research and design can accordingly address menopause not only as a women's health concern, but also as a matter of facilitating social support and a social justice issue.","Social Media technology can perpetuate gendered marginalization and alienation, particularly during menopause, by limiting meaningful social interactions and reinforcing negative experiences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300710,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
VARI-SOUND: A Varifocal Lens for Sound,"Centuries of development in optics have given us passive devices (i.e. lenses, mirrors and filters) to enrich audience immersivity with light effects, but there is nothing similar for sound. Beam-forming in concert halls and outdoor gigs still requires a large number of speakers, while headphones are still the state-of-the-art for personalized audio immersivity in VR. In this work, we show how 3D printed acoustic meta-surfaces, assembled into the equivalent of optical systems, may offer a different solution. We demonstrate how to build them and how to use simple design tools, like the thin-lens equation, also for sound. We present some key acoustic devices, like a ""collimator"", to transform a standard computer speaker into an acoustic ""spotlight""; and a ""magnifying glass"", to create sound sources coming from distinct locations than the speaker itself. Finally, we demonstrate an acoustic varifocal lens, discussing applications equivalent to auto-focus cameras and VR headsets and the limitations of the technology.","Over-reliance on technology and decreased social interaction.

The article discusses the development of technology to enhance audio immersivity in virtual reality, but it also highlights the potential negative consequence of people becoming too reliant on technology and losing social interaction. With the ability to create personalized audio experiences, people may become more isolated and less likely to engage with others in person. This could lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication and social skills, ultimately having a negative impact on society.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300713,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
"""Can you believe [1:21]?!"": Content and Time-Based Reference Patterns in Video Comments","As videos become increasingly ubiquitous, so is video-based commenting. To contextualize comments, people often reference specific audio/visual content within video. However, the literature falls short of explaining the types of video content people refer to, how they establish references and identify referents, how video characteristics (e.g., genre) impact referencing behaviors, and how references impact social engagement. We present a taxonomy for classifying video references by referent type and temporal specificity. Using our taxonomy, we analyzed 2.5K references with quotations and timestamps collected from public YouTube comments. We found: 1) people reference intervals of video more frequently than time-points, 2) visual entities are referenced more often than sounds, and 3) comments with quotes are more likely to receive replies but not more ""likes"". We discuss the need for in-situ dereferencing user interfaces, illustrate design concepts for typed referencing features, and provide a dataset for future studies.","People are becoming more focused on referencing and commenting on specific moments in videos, rather than engaging in meaningful conversations and social interactions. This can lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication and deepen the sense of isolation and loneliness.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300719,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Gaze-Guided Narratives: Adapting Audio Guide Content to Gaze in Virtual and Real Environments,"Exploring a city panorama from a vantage point is a popular tourist activity. Typical audio guides that support this activity are limited by their lack of responsiveness to user behavior and by the difficulty of matching audio descriptions to the panorama. These limitations can inhibit the acquisition of information and negatively affect user experience. This paper proposes Gaze-Guided Narratives as a novel interaction concept that helps tourists find specific features in the panorama (gaze guidance) while adapting the audio content to what has been previously looked at (content adaptation). Results from a controlled study in a virtual environment (n=60) revealed that a system featuring both gaze guidance and content adaptation obtained better user experience, lower cognitive load, and led to better performance in a mapping task compared to a classic audio guide. A second study with tourists situated at a vantage point (n=16) further demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in the real world.","

Embodied Imagination: An Approach to Stroke Recovery Combining Participatory Performance and Interactive Technology,"Participatory performance provides methods for exploring social identities and situations in ways that can help people to imagine new ways of being. Digital technologies provide tools that can help people envision these possibilities. We explore this combination through a performance workshop process designed to help stroke survivors imagine new physical and social possibilities by enacting fantasies of ""things they always wanted to do"". This process uses performance methods combined with specially designed real-time movement visualisations to progressively build fantasy narratives that are enacted with and for other workshop participants. Qualitative evaluations suggest this process successfully stimulates participant's embodied imagination and generates a diverse range of fantasies. The interactive and communal aspects of the workshop process appear to be especially important in achieving these effects. This work highlights how the combination of performance methods and interactive tools can bring a rich, prospective and political understanding of people's lived experience to design.","

The use of digital technologies, such as Augmented/Virtual Reality, can lead to a disconnection from reality and a reliance on technology to imagine and experience new possibilities, rather than encouraging people to explore and create them in the real world. This can result in a lack of engagement with the physical world and the people in it, leading to a decrease in social skills and a loss of connection with the community. Additionally, the use of technology to enact fantasies can create unrealistic expectations and promote escapism, rather than encouraging people to address and solve problems in the real world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300735,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
"Behind the Curtain of the ""Ultimate Empathy Machine"": On the Composition of Virtual Reality Nonfiction Experiences","Virtual Reality nonfiction (VRNF) is an emerging form of immersive media experience created for consumption using panoramic ""Virtual Reality"" headsets. VRNF promises nonfiction content producers the potential to create new ways for audiences to experience ""the real""; allowing viewers to transition from passive spectators to active participants. Our current project is exploring VRNF through a series of ethnographic and experimental studies. In order to document the content available, we embarked on an analysis of VR documentaries produced to date. In this paper, we present an analysis of a representative sample of 150 VRNF titles released between 2012-2018. We identify and quantify 64 characteristics of the medium over this period, discuss how producers are exploiting the affordances of VR, and shed light on new audience roles. Our findings provide insight into the current state of the art in VRNF and provide a digital resource for other researchers in this area.","

The article highlights the potential for Virtual Reality technology to blur the lines between reality and fiction, creating a new form of immersive media experience that can be exploited by content producers.

"Online, VR, AR, Lab, and In-Situ: Comparison of Research Methods to Evaluate Smart Artifacts","Empirical studies are a cornerstone of HCI research. Technical progress constantly enables new study methods. Online surveys, for example, make it possible to collect feedback from remote users. Progress in augmented and virtual reality enables to collect feedback with early designs. In-situ studies enable researchers to gather feedback in natural environments. While these methods have unique advantages and disadvantages, it is unclear if and how using a specific method affects the results. Therefore, we conducted a study with 60 participants comparing five different methods (online, virtual reality, augmented reality, lab setup, and in-situ) to evaluate early prototypes of smart artifacts. We asked participants to assess four different smart artifacts using standardized questionnaires. We show that the method significantly affects the study result and discuss implications for HCI research. Finally, we highlight further directions to overcome the effect of the used methods.","

Design and Evaluation of a Social Media Writing Support Tool for People with Dyslexia,"People with dyslexia face challenges expressing themselves in writing on social networking sites (SNSs). Such challenges come from not only the technicality of writing, but also the self-representation aspect of sharing and communicating publicly on social networking sites such as Facebook. To empower people with dyslexia-style writing to express them-selves more confidently on SNSs, we designed and implemented Additional Writing Help(AWH) - a writing assistance tool to proofread text produced by users with dyslexia before they post on Facebook. AWH was powered by a neural machine translation (NMT) model that translates dyslexia style to non-dyslexia style writing. We evaluated the performance and the design of AWH through a week-long field study with 19 people with dyslexia and received highly positive feedback. Our field study demonstrated the value of providing better and more extensive writing support on SNSs, and the potential of AI for building a more inclusive Internet.","People with dyslexia may struggle to express themselves confidently on social media due to the technicality of writing and self-representation aspects, which can lead to feelings of frustration and exclusion.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300746,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
I'm a Giant: Walking in Large Virtual Environments at High Speed Gains,"Advances in tracking technology and wireless headsets enable walking as a means of locomotion in Virtual Reality. When exploring virtual environments larger than room-scale, it is often desirable to increase users' perceived walking speed, for which we investigate three methods. (1) Ground-Level Scaling increases users' avatar size, allowing them to walk farther. (2) Eye-Level Scaling enables users to walk through a World in Miniature, while maintaining a street-level view. (3) Seven-League Boots amplifies users' movements along their walking path. We conduct a study comparing these methods and find that users feel most embodied using Ground-Level Scaling and consequently increase their stride length. Using Seven-League Boots, unlike the other two methods, diminishes positional accuracy at high gains, and users modify their walking behavior to compensate for the lack of control. We conclude with a discussion on each technique's strength and weaknesses and the types of situation they might be appropriate for.","Users may experience a decrease in positional accuracy when using certain methods to increase their walking speed in Virtual Reality, which could lead to disorientation and discomfort.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300752,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Does Being Verified Make You More Credible?: Account Verification's Effect on Tweet Credibility,"Many popular social networking and microblogging sites support verified accounts---user accounts that are deemed of public interest and whose owners have been authenticated by the site. Importantly, the content of messages contributed by verified account owners is not verified. Such messages may be factually correct, or not. This paper investigates whether users confuse authenticity with credibility by posing the question: Are users more likely to believe content from verified accounts than from non-verified accounts? We conduct two online studies, a year apart, with 748 and 2041 participants respectively, to assess how the presence or absence of verified account indicators influences users' perceptions of tweets. Surprisingly, across both studies, we find that---in the context of unfamiliar accounts---most users can effectively distinguish between authenticity and credibility. The presence or absence of an authenticity indicator has no significant effect on willingness to share a tweet or take action based on its contents.","Users may believe content from verified accounts more than non-verified accounts, even if the content is factually incorrect.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300755,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Does Who Matter?: Studying the Impact of Relationship Characteristics on Receptivity to Mobile IM Messages,"This study examines the characteristics of mobile instant-messaging users' relationships with their social contacts and the effects of both relationship and interruption context on four measures of receptivity: Attentiveness, Responsiveness, Interruptibility, and Opportuneness. Overall, interruption context overshadows relationship characteristics as predictors of all four of these facets of receptivity; this overshadowing was most acute for Interruptibility and Opportuneness, but existed for all factors. In addition, while Mobile Maintenance Expectation and Activity Engagement were negatively correlated with all receptivity measures, each such measure had its own set of predictors, highlighting the conceptual differences among the measures. Finally, delving more deeply into potential relationship effects, we found that a single, simple closeness question was as effective at predicting receptivity as the 12-item Unidimensional Relationship Closeness Scale.","Social Media technology can make people less attentive, responsive, and available to others in their lives, as they become more focused on their screens and notifications.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300756,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship

Personalising the TV Experience using Augmented Reality: An Exploratory Study on Delivering Synchronised Sign Language Interpretation,"Augmented Reality (AR) technology has the potential to extend the screen area beyond the rigid frames of televisions. The additional display area can be used to augment televisions (TVs) with extra information tailored to individuals, for instance, the provision of access services like sign language interpretations. We invited 23 (11 in the UK, 12 in Germany) users of signed content to evaluate three methods of watching a sign language interpreted programme - one traditional in-vision method with signed programme content on TV and two AR-enabled methods in which an AR sign language interpreter (a 'half-body' version and a 'full-body' version) is projected just outside the frame of the TV presenting the programme. In the UK, participants were split 3-ways in their preferences while in Germany, half the participants preferred the traditional method followed closely by the 'half-body' version. We discuss our participants reasoning behind their preferences and implications for future research.","

The use of Augmented Reality technology in television programming may lead to a decrease in traditional in-vision sign language interpretation methods, which are currently the most preferred method for accessing signed content among users. This could result in a loss of accessibility for individuals who rely on these methods, particularly in countries where AR technology is not yet widely available or accessible. Additionally, the use of AR technology may also lead to a reliance on technology rather than human interpreters, potentially leading to job loss in the sign language interpretation industry.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300762,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
FTVR in VR: Evaluation of 3D Perception With a Simulated Volumetric Fish-Tank Virtual Reality Display,"Spherical fish tank virtual reality (FTVR) displays attempt to create a virtual ""crystal ball"" experience using head-tracked rendering. Almost all of these systems have omitted stereo cues, making them easy to build, but it is not clear how much this omission degrades the 3D experience. In this study, we evaluate performance and subjective effects of stereo on 3D perception and interaction tasks with a spherical FTVR display. To control for calibration error and tracking latency, we perform the evaluation on a simulated spherical display in VR. The results of our study provide a clear recommendation for the design and use of spherical FTVR displays: while omitting stereo may not be readily apparent for users, their performance will be significantly degraded (20% - 91% increase in median task time). Therefore, including stereo viewing in spherical displays is critical for use in FTVR.","

What is Mixed Reality?,"What is Mixed Reality (MR)? To revisit this question given the many recent developments, we conducted interviews with ten AR/VR experts from academia and industry, as well as a literature survey of 68 papers. We find that, while there are prominent examples, there is no universally agreed on, one-size-fits-all definition of MR. Rather, we identified six partially competing notions from the literature and experts' responses. We then started to isolate the different aspects of reality relevant for MR experiences, going beyond the primarily visual notions and extending to audio, motion, haptics, taste, and smell. We distill our findings into a conceptual framework with seven dimensions to characterize MR applications in terms of the number of environments, number of users, level of immersion, level of virtuality, degree of interaction, input, and output. Our goal with this paper is to support classification and discussion of MR applications' design and provide a better means to researchers to contextualize their work within the increasingly fragmented MR landscape.","

Understanding Affective Experiences with Conversational Agents,"While previous studies of Conversational Agents (e.g. Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa and Cortana) have focused on evaluating usability and exploring capabilities of these systems, little work has examined users' affective experiences. In this paper we present a survey study with 171 participants to examine CA users' affective experiences. Specifically, we present four major usage scenarios, users' affective responses in these scenarios, and the factors which influenced the affective responses. We found that users' overall experience was positive with interest being the most salient positive emotion. Affective responses differed depending on the scenarios. Both pragmatic and hedonic qualities influenced affect. The factors underlying pragmatic quality are: helpfulness, proactivity, fluidity, seamlessness and responsiveness. The factors underlying hedonic quality are: comfort in human-machine conversation, pride of using cutting-edge technology, fun during use, perception of having a human-like assistant, concern about privacy and fear of causing distraction.",Users' privacy concerns and fear of causing distraction when using voice assistants.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300772,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
What Can We Learn from Augmented Reality (AR)?: Benefits and Drawbacks of AR for Inquiry-based Learning of Physics,"Emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), have the potential to radically transform education by making challenging concepts visible and accessible to novices. In this project, we have designed a Hololens-based system in which collaborators are exposed to an unstructured learning activity in which they learned about the invisible physics involved in audio speakers. They learned topics ranging from spatial knowledge, such as shape of magnetic fields, to abstract conceptual knowledge, such as relationships between electricity and magnetism. We compared participants' learning, attitudes and collaboration with a tangible interface through multiple experimental conditions containing varying layers of AR information. We found that educational AR representations were beneficial for learning specific knowledge and increasing participants' self-efficacy (i.e., their ability to learn concepts in physics). However, we also found that participants in conditions that did not contain AR educational content, learned some concepts better than other groups and became more curious about physics. We discuss learning and collaboration differences, as well as benefits and detriments of implementing augmented reality for unstructured learning activities.","Over-reliance on technology can lead to a decrease in critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as a lack of curiosity and exploration.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300774,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Pose-Guided Level Design,"Player's physical experience is a critical factor to consider in designing motion-based games that are played through motion sensor gaming consoles or virtual reality devices. However, adjusting the physical challenge involved in a motion-based game is difficult and tedious, as it is typically done manually by level designers on a trial-and-error basis. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatically synthesizing levels for motion-based games that can achieve desired physical movement goals. By formulating the level design problem as a trans-dimensional optimization problem which is solved by a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we show that our approach can automatically synthesize a variety of game levels, each carrying the desired physical movement properties. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we synthesize game levels for two different types of motion-based games and conduct a user study to validate the effectiveness of our approach.",Over-reliance on technology and lack of physical activity.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300784,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Investigating Implicit Gender Bias and Embodiment of White Males in Virtual Reality with Full Body Visuomotor Synchrony,"Previous research has shown that when White people embody a black avatar in virtual reality (VR) with full body visuomotor synchrony, this can reduce their implicit racial bias. In this paper, we put men in female and male avatars in VR with full visuomotor synchrony using wearable trackers and investigated implicit gender bias and embodiment. We found that participants embodied in female avatars displayed significantly higher levels of implicit gender bias than those embodied in male avatars. The implicit gender bias actually increased after exposure to female embodiment in contrast to male embodiment. Results also showed that participants felt embodied in their avatars regardless of gender matching, demonstrating that wearable trackers can be used for a realistic sense of avatar embodiment in VR. We discuss the future implications of these findings for both VR scenarios and embodiment technologies.","

Shaping Pro-Social Interaction in VR: An Emerging Design Framework,"Commercial social VR applications represent a diverse and evolving ecology with competing models of what it means to be social in VR. Drawing from expert interviews, this paper examines how the creators of different social VR applications think about how their platforms frame, support, shape, or constrain social interaction. The study covers a range of applications including: Rec Room, High Fidelity, VRChat, Mozilla Hubs, Altspace VR, AnyLand, and Facebook Spaces. We contextualize design choices underlying these applications, with particular attention paid to the ways that industry experts perceive, and seek to shape, the relationship between user experiences and design choices. We underscore considerations related to: (1) aesthetics of place (2) embodied affordances, (3) social mechanics, (4) and tactics for shaping social norms and mitigating harassment. Drawing on this analysis, we discuss the stakes of these choices, suggest future research directions, and propose an emerging design framework for shaping pro-social behavior in VR.","Social isolation and decreased face-to-face interaction.

Tool Extension in Human-Computer Interaction,"Tool use extends people's representations of the immediately actionable space around them. Physical tools thereby become integrated in people's body schemas. We introduce a measure for tool extension in HCI by using a visual-tactile interference paradigm. In this paradigm, an index of tool extension is given by response time differences between crossmodally congruent and incongruent stimuli; tactile on the hand and visual on the tool. We use this measure to examine if and how findings on tool extension apply to interaction with computer-based tools. Our first experiment shows that touchpad and mouse both provide tool extension over a baseline condition without a tool. A second experiment shows a higher degree of tool extension for a realistic avatar hand compared to an abstract pointer for interaction in virtual reality. In sum, our measure can detect tool extension with computer-based tools and differentiate interfaces by their degree of extension.","

Participatory Design of VR Scenarios for Exposure Therapy,"Virtual reality (VR) applications for exposure therapy predominantly use computer-generated imagery to create controlled environments in which users can be exposed to their fears. Creating 3D animations, however, is demanding and time-consuming. This paper presents a participatory approach for prototyping VR scenarios that are enabled by 360° video and grounded in lived experiences. We organized a participatory workshop with adolescents to prototype such scenarios, consisting of iterative phases of ideation, storyboarding, live-action plays recorded by a 360° camera, and group evaluation. Through an analysis of the participants' interactions, we outline how they worked to design prototypes that depict situations relevant to those with a fear of public speaking. Our analysis also explores how participants used their experiences and reflections as resources for design. Six clinical psychologists evaluated the prototypes from the workshop and concluded they were viable therapeutic tools, emphasizing the immersive, realistic experience they presented. We argue that our approach makes the design of VR scenarios more accessible.","Over-reliance on technology for therapy.

Abstract Machines: Overlaying Virtual Worlds on Physical Rides,"Overlaying virtual worlds onto existing physical rides and altering the sensations of motion can deliver new experiences of thrill, but designing how motion is mapped between physical ride and virtual world is challenging. In this paper, we present the notion of an abstract machine, a new form of intermediate design knowledge that communicates motion mappings at the level of metaphor, mechanism and implementation. Following a performance-led, in-the-wild approach we report lessons from creating and touring VR Playground, a ride that overlays four distinct abstract machines and virtual worlds on a playground swing. We compare the artist's rationale with riders' reported experiences and analysis of their physical behaviours to reveal the distinct thrills of each abstract machine. Finally, we discuss how to make and use abstract machines in terms of heuristics for designing motion mappings, principles for virtual world design and communicating experiences to riders.","Over-reliance on technology and decreased physical activity.

Group Interactions in Location-Based Gaming: A Case Study of Raiding in Pokémon GO,"Raiding is a format in digital gaming that requires groups of people to collaborate and/or compete for a common goal. In 2017, the raiding format was introduced in the location-based mobile game Pokémon GO, which offers a mixed reality experience to friends and strangers coordinating for in-person raids. To understand this technology-mediated social phenomenon, we conducted over a year of participant observations, surveys with 510 players, and interviews with 25 players who raid in Pokémon GO. Using the analytical lens of Arrow, McGrath, and Berdahl's theory of small groups as complex systems, we identify global, local, and contextual dynamics in location-based raiding that support and challenge ad-hoc group formation in real life. Based on this empirical and theoretical understanding, we discuss implications to design for transparency, social affordances, and bridging gaps between global and contextual dynamics for increased positive and inclusive community interactions.","

The article highlights how location-based mobile games like Pokémon GO can create a false sense of community and social interaction. While players may collaborate and communicate with each other during raids, the game's design can also lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, as well as reinforce existing social hierarchies and exclusions. This can result in a negative and isolating experience for some players, particularly those who are already marginalized or excluded from mainstream society.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300817,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Understanding Online News Behaviors,"The news landscape has been changing dramatically over the past few years. Whereas news once came from a small set of highly edited sources, now people can find news from thousands of news sites online, through a variety of channels such as web search, social media, email newsletters, or direct browsing. We set out to understand how Americans read news online using web browser logs collected from 174 diverse participants. We found that 20% of all news sessions started with a web search, that 16% started from social media, that 61% of news sessions only involved a single news domain, and that 47% of our participants read news from both sides of the political spectrum.

Voice Presentation Attack Detection through Text-Converted Voice Command Analysis,"Voice assistants are quickly being upgraded to support advanced, security-critical commands such as unlocking devices, checking emails, and making payments. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using users' text-converted voice command utterances as classification features to help identify users' genuine commands, and detect suspicious commands. To maintain high detection accuracy, our approach starts with a globally trained attack detection model (immediately available for new users), and gradually switches to a user-specific model tailored to the utterance patterns of a target user. To evaluate accuracy, we used a real-world voice assistant dataset consisting of about 34.6 million voice commands collected from 2.6 million users. Our evaluation results show that this approach is capable of achieving about 3.4% equal error rate (EER), detecting 95.7% of attacks when an optimal threshold value is used. As for those who frequently use security-critical (attack-like) commands, we still achieve EER below 5%.","Voice assistants can be used to make payments and check emails, but this also means that they can be used to make fraudulent payments or access sensitive information without the user's knowledge or consent.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300828,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Designing User Interface Elements to Improve the Quality and Civility of Discourse in Online Commenting Behaviors,"Ensuring high-quality, civil social interactions remains a vexing challenge in many online spaces. In the present work, we introduce a novel approach to address this problem: using psychologically ""embedded'' CAPTCHAs containing stimuli intended to prime positive emotions and mindsets. An exploratory randomized experiment (N = 454 Mechanical Turk workers) tested the impact of eight new CAPTCHA designs implemented on a simulated, politically charged comment thread. Results revealed that the two interventions that were the most successful at activating positive affect also significantly increased the positivity of tone and analytical complexity of argumentation in participants' responses. A focused follow-up experiment (N = 120 Mechanical Turk workers) revealed that exposure to CAPTCHAs featuring image sets previously validated to evoke low-arousal positive emotions significantly increased the positivity of sentiment and the levels of complexity and social connectedness in participants' posts. We offer several explanations for these results and discuss the practical and ethical implications of designing interfaces to influence discourse in online forums.","Social Media technology can lead to low-quality, uncivil interactions in online spaces.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300836,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Warping Deixis: Distorting Gestures to Enhance Collaboration,"When engaged in communication, people often rely on pointing gestures to refer to out-of-reach content. However, observers frequently misinterpret the target of a pointing gesture. Previous research suggests that to perform a pointing gesture, people place the index finger on or close to a line connecting the eye to the referent, while observers interpret pointing gestures by extrapolating the referent using a vector defined by the arm and index finger. In this paper we present Warping Deixis, a novel approach to improving the perception of pointing gestures and facilitate communication in collaborative Extended Reality environments. By warping the virtual representation of the pointing individual, we are able to match the pointing expression to the observer's perception. We evaluated our approach in a co-located side by side virtual reality scenario. Results suggest that our approach is effective in improving the interpretation of pointing gestures in shared virtual environments.",Misinterpretation of pointing gestures in shared virtual environments.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300838,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Resolving Target Ambiguity in 3D Gaze Interaction through VOR Depth Estimation,"Target disambiguation is a common problem in gaze interfaces, as eye tracking has accuracy and precision limitations. In 3D environments this is compounded by objects overlapping in the field of view, as a result of their positioning at different depth with partial occlusion. We introduce VOR depth estimation, a method based on the Vestibulo-ocular reflex of the eyes in compensation of head movement, and explore its application to resolve target ambiguity. The method estimates gaze depth by comparing the rotations of the eye and the head when the users look at a target and deliberately rotate their head. We show that VOR eye movement presents an alternative to vergence for gaze depth estimation, that is feasible also with monocular tracking. In an evaluation of its use for target disambiguation, our method outperforms vergence for targets presented at greater depth.","

The use of VOR depth estimation in gaze interfaces can lead to eye strain and discomfort for users, as they need to deliberately rotate their head to estimate gaze depth. This can cause fatigue and eye discomfort, especially for prolonged use. Additionally, the method may not be effective for users with vestibular disorders or other conditions that affect the Vestibulo-ocular reflex.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300842,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"Understanding Digitally-Mediated Empathy: An Exploration of Visual, Narrative, and Biosensory Informational Cues","Digitally sharing our experiences engages a process of empathy shaped by available informational cues. Biosensory data is one informative cue, but the relationship to empathy is underexplored. In this study, we investigate this process by showing a video of a ""target'' person's visual perspective watching a virtual reality film to sixty ""observers''. We vary information available to observers via three experimental conditions: a baseline unmodified video, video with narrative text, or with a graph of electrodermal activity (EDA) of the target. Compared to baseline, narrative text increased empathic accuracy (EA) while EDA had an opposite, negative effect. Qualitatively, observers describe their empathic processes as using their own feelings supplemented with the information presented depending on the interpretability of that information. Both narration and EDA prompted observers to reconsider assumptions about another's experience. Our findings lead to a discussion of digitally-mediated empathy with implications for associated research and product development.","

Crossing-Based Selection with Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays,"This paper presents the first investigation into using the goal-crossing paradigm for object selection with virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays. Two experiments were carried out to evaluate ray-casting crossing tasks with target discs in 3D space and goal lines on 2D plane respectively in comparison to ray-casting pointing tasks. Five factors, i.e. task difficulty, the direction of movement constraint (collinear vs. orthogonal), the nature of the task (discrete vs. continuous), field of view of VR devices and target depth, were considered in both experiments. Our findings are: (1) crossing generally had shorter or no longer time, and higher or similar accuracy than pointing, indicating crossing can complement or substitute pointing; (2) crossing tasks can be well modelled with Fitts' Law; (3) crossing performance depended on target depth; (4) crossing target discs in 3D space differed from crossing goal lines on 2D plane in many aspects such as time and error performance, the effects of target depth and the parameters of Fitts' models. Based on these findings, we formulate a number of design recommendations for crossing-based interaction in VR.","

The study found that crossing-based interaction in VR can have shorter or no longer time and higher or similar accuracy than pointing-based interaction. However, this may lead to users relying too heavily on crossing-based interaction, which can result in a lack of spatial awareness and understanding of the virtual environment. This can lead to users becoming disoriented and experiencing motion sickness. Additionally, the study found that crossing performance depended on target depth, which can cause issues for users who have difficulty judging depth in 3D space. This can result in users missing targets or interacting with the wrong objects, leading to frustration and decreased productivity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300848,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Audible Panorama: Automatic Spatial Audio Generation for Panorama Imagery,"As 360 deg cameras and virtual reality headsets become more popular, panorama images have become increasingly ubiquitous. While sounds are essential in delivering immersive and interactive user experiences, most panorama images, however, do not come with native audio. In this paper, we propose an automatic algorithm to augment static panorama images through realistic audio assignment. We accomplish this goal through object detection, scene classification, object depth estimation, and audio source placement. We built an audio file database composed of over $500$ audio files to facilitate this process. We designed and conducted a user study to verify the efficacy of various components in our pipeline. We run our method on a large variety of panorama images of indoor and outdoor scenes. By analyzing the statistics, we learned the relative importance of these components, which can be used in prioritizing for power-sensitive time-critical tasks like mobile augmented reality (AR) applications.","

The algorithm proposed in the article can potentially create a false sense of reality by adding realistic audio to virtual environments, which could lead to confusion or disorientation for users, especially in situations where the virtual environment is meant to mimic real-life scenarios. This could have negative consequences in areas such as education, training, or emergency response, where accurate perception of reality is crucial. Additionally, the use of audio to create a more immersive experience could also lead to increased sensory overload and decreased user attention, potentially resulting in adverse effects on mental health and well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300851,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Interactive Body-Driven Graphics for Augmented Video Performance,"We present a system that augments live presentation videos with interactive graphics to create a powerful and expressive storytelling environment. Using our system, the presenter interacts with the graphical elements in real-time with gestures and postures, thus leveraging our innate, everyday skills to enhance our communication capabilities with the audience. However, crafting such an interactive and expressive performance typically requires programming, or highly-specialized tools tailored for experts. Our core contribution is a flexible, direct manipulation UI which enables amateurs and experts to craft such presentations beforehand by mapping a variety of body movements to a wide range of graphical manipulations. By simplifying the mapping between gestures, postures, and their corresponding output effects, our UI enables users to craft customized, rich interactions with the graphical elements. Our user study demonstrates the potential usage and unique affordance of this mixed-reality medium for storytelling and presentation across a range of application domains.","

A Design Space for Gaze Interaction on Head-mounted Displays,"Augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) has entered the mass market and, with it, will soon eye tracking as a core technology for next generation head-mounted displays (HMDs). In contrast to existing gaze interfaces, the 3D nature of AR and VR requires estimating a user's gaze in 3D. While first applications, such as foveated rendering, hint at the compelling potential of combining HMDs and gaze, a systematic analysis is missing. To fill this gap, we present the first design space for gaze interaction on HMDs. Our design space covers human depth perception and technical requirements in two dimensions aiming to identify challenges and opportunities for interaction design. As such, our design space provides a comprehensive overview and serves as an important guideline for researchers and practitioners working on gaze interaction on HMDs. We further demonstrate how our design space is used in practice by presenting two interactive applications: EyeHealth and XRay-Vision.","

The use of eye-tracking technology in AR/VR headsets could potentially lead to privacy concerns, as it could allow for the collection of sensitive information about users' gaze patterns and interests. This could be used for targeted advertising or other malicious purposes. Additionally, the technology could be used to manipulate users' perceptions and behaviors, as it can influence what they focus on and how they interact with virtual objects.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300855,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
The Heat is On: Exploring User Behaviour in a Multisensory Virtual Environment for Fire Evacuation,"Understanding validity of user behaviour in Virtual Environments (VEs) is critical as they are increasingly being used for serious Health and Safety applications such as predicting human behaviour and training in hazardous situations. This paper presents a comparative study exploring user behaviour in VE-based fire evacuation and investigates whether this is affected by the addition of thermal and olfactory simulation. Participants (N=43) were exposed to a virtual fire in an office building. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of participant attitudes and behaviours found deviations from those we would expect in real life (e.g. pre-evacuation actions), but also valid behaviours like fire avoidance. Potentially important differences were found between multisensory and audiovisual-only conditions (e.g. perceived urgency). We conclude VEs have significant potential in safety-related applications, and that multimodality may afford additional uses in this context, but the identified limitations of behavioural validity must be carefully considered to avoid misapplication of the technology.","

The study found that users' behavior in virtual environments deviated from real-life behavior in some cases, such as pre-evacuation actions. This raises concerns about the validity of using virtual environments for training and predicting human behavior in hazardous situations. Additionally, the study found that users' perception of urgency was affected by the addition of thermal and olfactory simulation, which could potentially lead to inadequate responses in real-life emergency situations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300856,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Is Now A Good Time?: An Empirical Study of Vehicle-Driver Communication Timing,"Advances in automotive sensing systems and speech interfaces provide new opportunities for smarter driving assistants or infotainment systems. For both safety and consumer satisfaction reasons, any new system which interacts with drivers must do so at appropriate times. We asked 63 drivers, ''Is now a good time?'' to receive non-driving information during a 50-minute drive. We analyzed 2,734 responses and synchronized automotive and video data, and show that while the chances of choosing a good time can be determined with better success using easily accessible automotive data, certain nuances in the problem require a richer understanding of the driver and environment states in order to achieve higher performance. We illustrate several of these nuances with quantitative and qualitative analyses to contribute to the understanding of how to design a system that might simultaneously minimize the risk of interacting at a bad time while maximizing the window of allowable interruption.","Drivers may be distracted by non-driving information while driving, leading to increased risk of accidents.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300867,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Keeping Rumors in Proportion: Managing Uncertainty in Rumor Systems,"The study of rumors has garnered wider attention as regulators and researchers turn towards problems of misinformation on social media. One goal has been to discover and implement mechanisms that promote healthy information ecosystems. Classically defined as regarding ambiguous situations, rumors pose the unique difficulty of intrinsic uncertainty around their veracity. Further complicating matters, rumors can serve the public when they do spread valuable true information. To address these challenges, we develop an approach that reifies ""rumor proportions"" as central to the theory of systems for managing rumors. We use this lens to advocate for systems that, rather than aiming to stifle rumors entirely or aiming to stop only false rumors, aim to prevent rumors from growing out of proportion relative to normative benchmark representations of intrinsic uncertainty.","Social media can spread misinformation and make it difficult to distinguish between true and false information, leading to confusion and uncertainty.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300876,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Long-Term Value of Social Robots through the Eyes of Expert Users,"Socially-enabled digital technologies have attracted academic interest for decades, with recent commercial examples of Siri and Alexa, capturing public attention. However, despite ubiquitous visions of a robotic future, very few fully-fledged social robots are currently available to consumers. To improve their designs, studies of their long-term use are particularly valuable, but are currently unavailable. To address this gap, we report on interviews with four long-term users of Pepper - a social robot introduced in 2014. Our thematic analysis elicited insights across three kinds of value Pepper brought to its users: utilitarian functionality; the community that formed around Pepper; and a personal value of affection. We focus on two contributions those values bring to social robot design: social robots as social proxies, alleviating disabilities or acting akin to social media profiles; and robot nurturing as a design construct, going beyond purely utilitarian or hedonistic perspectives on robots.","

The article highlights the lack of long-term studies on the use of social robots, which can lead to a lack of understanding of their impact on society. This can result in the development of robots that do not align with societal values and may have unintended consequences, such as exacerbating social isolation or creating new forms of inequality.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300896,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
Measuring and Understanding Photo Sharing Experiences in Social Virtual Reality,"Millions of photos are shared online daily, but the richness of interaction compared with face-to-face (F2F) sharing is still missing. While this may change with social Virtual Reality (socialVR), we still lack tools to measure such immersive and interactive experiences. In this paper, we investigate photo sharing experiences in immersive environments, focusing on socialVR. Running context mapping (N=10), an expert creative session (N=6), and an online experience clustering questionnaire (N=20), we develop and statistically evaluate a questionnaire to measure photo sharing experiences. We then ran a controlled, within-subject study (N=26 pairs) to compare photo sharing under F2F, Skype, and Facebook Spaces. Using interviews, audio analysis, and our questionnaire, we found that socialVR can closely approximate F2F sharing. We contribute empirical findings on the immersiveness differences between digital communication media, and propose a socialVR questionnaire that can in the future generalize beyond photo sharing.","Lack of face-to-face interaction and immersive experiences in digital communication media, which can lead to a decrease in the richness of human connection and deepen feelings of loneliness and isolation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300897,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Does It Feel Real?: Using Tangibles with Different Fidelities to Build and Explore Scenes in Virtual Reality,"Professionals in domains like film, theater, or architecture often rely on physical models to visualize spaces. With virtual reality (VR) new tools are available providing immersive experiences with correct perceptions of depth and scale. However, these lack the tangibility of physical models. Using tangible objects in VR can close this gap but creates the challenges of producing suitable objects and interacting with them with only the virtual objects visible. This work addresses these challenges by evaluating tangibles with three haptic fidelities: equal disc-shaped tangibles for all virtual objects, Lego-built tangibles, and 3D-printed tangibles resembling the virtual shapes. We present results from a comparative study on immersion, performance, and intuitive interaction and interviews with domain experts. The results show that 3D-printed objects perform best, but Lego offers a good trade-off between fast creation of tangibles and sufficient fidelity. The experts rate our approach as useful and would use all three versions.","

Adding Proprioceptive Feedback to Virtual Reality Experiences Using Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation,"We present a small and lightweight wearable device that enhances virtual reality experiences and reduces cybersickness by means of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). GVS is a specific way to elicit vestibular reflexes that has been used for over a century to study the function of the vestibular system. In addition to GVS, we support physiological sensing by connecting heart rate, electrodermal activity and other sensors to our wearable device using a plug and play mechanism. An accompanying Android app communicates with the device over Bluetooth (BLE) for transmitting the GVS stimulus to the user through electrodes attached behind the ears. Our system supports multiple categories of virtual reality applications with different types of virtual motion such as driving, navigating by flying, teleporting, or riding. We present a user study in which participants (N = 20) experienced significantly lower cybersickness when using our device and rated experiences with GVS-induced haptic feedback as significantly more immersive than a no-GVS baseline.","Cybersickness, which can be caused by virtual reality experiences and can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and disorientation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300905,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Virtual Objects in the Physical World: Relatedness and Psychological Ownership in Augmented Reality,"As technology advances, people increasingly interact with virtual objects in settings such as augmented reality (AR) where the virtual layer is superimposed on top of the physical world. Similarly to interactions with physical objects, users may assign virtual objects with value, experience a sense of relatedness, and develop psychological ownership over these objects. The objective of this study is to understand how AR's unique characteristics influences the emergence of meaning and ownership perceptions amongst users. We conducted a study of users' interactions with a virtual dog over a three-week period, comparing AR and fully virtual settings. Our findings show that engagement with the application is a key determinant of the relation users develop with virtual objects. However, the effect of the background layer-whether physical or virtual-dominates the development of relatedness and ownership feelings, highlighting the importance of the ""real"" physical layer in shaping users' perceptions.","People may develop a stronger sense of ownership and attachment to virtual objects than physical objects, leading to a blurred line between what is real and what is not. This could result in a decrease in the value of physical objects and a loss of connection to the real world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300921,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Signal Appropriation of Explicit HIV Status Disclosure Fields in Sex-Social Apps used by Gay and Bisexual Men,"HIV status disclosure fields in online sex-social applications (""apps"") are designed to help increase awareness, reduce stigma, and promote sexual health. Public disclosure could also help those diagnosed relate to others with similar statuses to feel less isolated. However, in our interview study (n=28) with HIV positive and negative men who have sex with men (MSM), we found some users preferred to keep their status private, especially when disclosure could stigmatise and disadvantage them, or risk revealing their status to someone they knew offline in a different context. How do users manage these tensions between health, stigma, and privacy? We analysed our interview data using signalling theory as a conceptual framework and identify participants developing 'signal appropriation' strategies, helping them manage the disclosure of their HIV status. Additionally, we propose a set of design considerations that explore the use of signals in the design of sensitive disclosure fields.","

Egocentric Smaller-person Experience through a Change in Visual Perspective,"This paper explores how human perceptions, actions, and interactions can be changed through an embodied and active experience of being a smaller person in a real-world environment, which we call an egocentric smaller person experience. We developed a wearable visual translator that provides the perspective of a smaller person by shifting the wearer's eyesight level down to their waist using a head-mounted display and a stereo camera module, while allowing for field of view control through head movements. In this study, we investigated how the developed device can modify the wearer's body representation and experiences based on a field study conducted at a nursing school and museums, and through lab studies. It was observed that the participants changed their perceptions, actions, and interactions because they are considered to have perceived themselves as being smaller. Using this device, designers and teachers can understand the perspectives of other people in an existing environment.","

Sensory Alignment in Immersive Entertainment,"When we use digital systems to stimulate the senses, we typically stimulate only a subset of users' senses, leaving other senses stimulated by the physical world. This creates potential for misalignment between senses, where digital and physical stimulation give conflicting signals to users. We synthesize knowledge from HCI, traditional entertainments, and underlying sensory science research relating to how senses work when given conflicting signals. Using this knowledge we present a design dimension of sensory alignment, and show how this dimension presents opportunities for a range of creative strategies ranging from full alignment of sensory stimulation, up to extreme conflict between senses.","Conflicting signals between digital and physical stimuli can cause misalignment of senses, leading to disorientation, confusion, and potentially harmful effects on users' perception and understanding of reality.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300930,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
How to Design Voice Based Navigation for How-To Videos,"When watching how-to videos related to physical tasks, users' hands are often occupied by the task, making voice input a natural fit. To better understand the design space of voice interactions for how-to video navigation, we conducted three think-aloud studies using: 1) a traditional video interface, 2) a research probe providing a voice controlled video interface, and 3) a wizard-of-oz interface. From the studies, we distill seven navigation objectives and their underlying intents: pace control pause, content alignment pause, video control pause, reference jump, replay jump, skip jump, and peek jump. Our analysis found that users' navigation objectives and intents affect the choice of referent type and referencing approach in command utterances. Based on our findings, we recommend to 1) support conversational strategies like sequence expansions and command queues, 2) allow users to identify and refine their navigation objectives explicitly, and 3) support the seven interaction intents.","

The use of voice assistants for how-to videos may lead to a lack of manual dexterity and problem-solving skills, as users rely on voice commands instead of using their hands to navigate and control the video. This could result in a decrease in fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination, which are important for many everyday tasks and activities. Additionally, the reliance on voice assistants may also lead to a decrease in critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, as users may not need to think as critically when navigating through a video.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300931,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Breaking! A Typology of Security and Privacy News and How It's Shared,"News coverage of security and privacy (S&P) events is pervasive and may affect the salience of S&P threats to the public. To better understand this coverage and its effects, we asked: What types of S&P news come into people's awareness? How do people hear about and share this news? Over two years, we recruited 1999 participants to fill out a survey on emergent S&P news events. We identified four types of S&P news: financial data breaches, corporate personal data breaches, high sensitivity systems breaches, and politicized / activist cybersecurity. These event types strongly correlated with how people shared S&P news-e.g., financial data breaches were shared most (42%), while politicized / activist cybersecurity events were shared least (21%). Furthermore, participants' age, gender and security behavioral intention strongly correlated with how they heard about and shared S&P news-e.g., males more often felt a personal responsibility to share, and older people were less likely to hear about S&P news through conversation.","Overexposure to security and privacy threats in the news can lead to desensitization, making people less likely to take personal responsibility for their own security and privacy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173575,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Designing the Desirable Smart Home: A Study of Household Experiences and Energy Consumption Impacts,"Research has shown that desirable designs shape the use and experiences people have when interacting with technology. Nevertheless, how desirability influences energy consumption is often overlooked, particularly in HCI studies evaluating the sustainability benefits of smart home technology. In this paper, we present a qualitative study with 23 Australian households who reflect on their experiences of living with smart home devices. Drawing on Nelson and Stolterman's concept of desiderata we develop a typology of householders' desires for the smart home and their energy implications. We structure these desires as three smart home personas: the helper, optimiser and hedonist, which align with desiderata's three approaches to desire (reason, ethics and aesthetics). We use these insights to discuss how desirability can be used within HCI for steering design of the smart home towards sustainability.","

Patterns for How Users Overcome Obstacles in Voice User Interfaces,"Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are growing in popularity. However, even the most current VUIs regularly cause frustration for their users. Very few studies exist on what people do to overcome VUI problems they encounter, or how VUIs can be designed to aid people when these problems occur. In this paper, we analyze empirical data on how users (n=12) interact with our VUI calendar system, DiscoverCal, over three sessions. In particular, we identify the main obstacle categories and types of tactics our participants employ to overcome them. We analyzed the patterns of how different tactics are used in each obstacle category. We found that while NLP Error obstacles occurred the most, other obstacles are more likely to frustrate or confuse the user. We also found patterns that suggest participants were more likely to employ a ""guessing"" approach rather than rely on visual aids or knowledge recall.","Frustration and confusion caused by Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) due to NLP errors and other obstacles, leading users to employ a ""guessing"" approach rather than relying on visual aids or knowledge recall.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173580,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
CivilServant: Community-Led Experiments in Platform Governance,"As online platforms monitor and intervene in the daily lives of billions of people, platforms are being used to govern enduring social problems. Field experiments could inform wise uses of this power if tensions between democratic values and experimentation could be resolved. In this paper, we introduce CivilServant, a novel experimentation infrastructure that online communities and their moderators use to evaluate policies and replicate each others' findings. We situate CivilServant in the political history of policy experiments and present design considerations for community participation, ethics, and replication. Based on two case studies of community-led experiments and public debriefings on the reddit platform, we share findings on community deliberation about experiment results. We also report on uses of evidence, finding that experiments informed moderator practices, community policies, and replications by communities and platforms.

Admixed Portrait: Design to Understand Facebook Portrayals in New Parenthood,"We report on a design-led study of the photographic representation of self and family on Facebook during and after becoming parents for the first time. Our experience-centered, research-through-design study engaged eight participants across five UK homes, in a month-long deployment of a prototype technology -- a design research artifact, Admixed Portrait, that served to prompt participant reflection on first-time parenthood. In addition to pre- and post-deployment interviews, participants kept diaries capturing personal reflections during the deployment, on daily social media use and interactions with Admixed. Our qualitative insights on social media representations of transitional experience and identity for new parents, reveal how their online 'photowork' related to self-expression and social functioning.

MABLE: Mediating Young Children's Smart Media Usage with Augmented Reality,"There has been a growing concern over the huge increase in use of smart media by young children. This study explores the possibility of using augmented-reality(AR) for regulat-ing preschoolers' media usage behavior. With MABLE (mobile application for behavioral learning and education), parents can provide AR-assisted feedback by changing facial expressions and sound effects. When overlaying a smart media, which has MABLE running, in front of a QR marker on a puppet, a facial expression is displayed on top of the puppet's face. A two-week long experiment with 36 parent-child pairs showed that compared to using just the puppet, using MABLE showed higher amount of engage-ment among preschoolers.

The Illusion of Control: Placebo Effects of Control Settings,"Algorithmic prioritization is a growing focus for social media users. Control settings are one way for users to adjust the prioritization of their news feeds, but they prioritize feed content in a way that can be difficult to judge objectively. In this work, we study how users engage with difficult-to-validate controls. Via two paired studies using an experimental system -- one interview and one online study -- we found that control settings functioned as placebos. Viewers felt more satisfied with their feed when controls were present, whether they worked or not. We also examine how people engage in sensemaking around control settings, finding that users often take responsibility for violated expectations -- for both real and randomly functioning controls. Finally, we studied how users controlled their social media feeds in the wild. The use of existing social media controls had little impact on user's satisfaction with the feed; instead, users often turned to improvised solutions, like scrolling quickly, to see what they want.","Social media users are given false sense of control over their news feeds through algorithmic prioritization, which can lead to users taking responsibility for violated expectations and using improvised solutions that have little impact on their satisfaction with the feed.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173590,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Easy Return: An App for Indoor Backtracking Assistance,"We present a system that, implemented as an iPhone app controllable from an Apple Watch, can help a blind person backtrack a route taken in a building. This system requires no maps of the building or environment modifications. While traversing a path from a starting location to a destination, the system builds and records a path representation in terms of a sequence of turns and of step counts between turns. If the user wants to backtrack the same path, the system can provide assistance by tracking the user's location in the recorded path, and producing directional information in speech form about the next turns and step counts to follow. The system was tested with six blind participants in a controlled indoor experiment.","

The system can only provide assistance in backtracking the same path that was previously recorded, and may not be able to adapt to changes in the environment or unexpected obstacles. Additionally, the system relies on the user's ability to accurately recall the sequence of turns and step counts, which may be challenging for some users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173591,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Flexible and Mindful Self-Tracking: Design Implications from Paper Bullet Journals,"Digital self-tracking technologies offer many potential benefits over self-tracking with paper notebooks. However, they are often too rigid to support people's practical and emotional needs in everyday settings. To inform the design of more flexible self-tracking tools, we examine bullet journaling: an analogue and customisable approach for logging and reflecting on everyday life. Analysing a corpus of paper bullet journal photos and related conversations on Instagram, we found that individuals extended and adapted bullet journaling systems to their changing practical and emotional needs through: (1) creating and combining personally meaningful visualisations of different types of trackers, such as habit, mood, and symptom trackers; (2) engaging in mindful reflective thinking through design practices and self-reflective strategies; and (3) posting photos of paper journals online to become part of a self-tracking culture of sharing and learning. We outline two interrelated design directions for flexible and mindful self-tracking: digitally extending analogue self-tracking and supporting digital self-tracking as a mindful design practice.","

The over-reliance on digital self-tracking technologies can lead to a lack of flexibility and customization in supporting individuals' unique practical and emotional needs. This can result in a one-size-fits-all approach that may not effectively address the complexities of everyday life. Additionally, the emphasis on digital tracking can lead to a culture of sharing and comparison, which can foster feelings of inadequacy and competition rather than mindfulness and self-awareness.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173602,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Eyes-Free Target Acquisition in Interaction Space around the Body for Virtual Reality,"Eyes-free target acquisition is a basic and important human ability to interact with the surrounding physical world, relying on the sense of space and proprioception. In this research, we leverage this ability to improve interaction in virtual reality (VR), by allowing users to acquire a virtual object without looking at it. We expect this eyes-free approach can effectively reduce head movements and focus changes, so as to speed up the interaction and alleviate fatigue and VR sickness. We conduct three lab studies to progressively investigate the feasibility and usability of eyes-free target acquisition in VR. Results show that, compared with the eyes-engaged manner, the eyes-free approach is significantly faster, provides satisfying accuracy, and introduces less fatigue and sickness; Most participants (13/16) prefer this approach. We also measure the accuracy of motion control and evaluate subjective experience of users when acquiring targets at different locations around the body. Based on the results, we make suggestions on designing appropriate target layout and discuss several design issues for eyes-free target acquisition in VR.","Reduced ability to interact with the physical world, increased reliance on technology, potential for decreased spatial awareness and proprioception.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173616,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"Reading on Smart Glasses: The Effect of Text Position, Presentation Type and Walking","Smart glasses are increasingly being used in professional contexts. Having key applications such as short messaging and newsreader, they enable continuous access to textual information. In particular, smart glasses allow reading while performing other activities as they do not occlude the user's world view. For efficient reading, it is necessary to understand how a text should be presented on them. We, therefore, conducted a study with 24 participants using a Microsoft HoloLens to investigate how to display text on smart glasses while walking and sitting. We compared text presentation in the top-right, center, and bottom-center positions with Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) and line-by-line scrolling. We found that text displayed in the top-right of smart glasses increases subjective workload and reduces comprehension. RSVP yields higher comprehension while sitting. Conversely, reading with scrolling yields higher comprehension while walking. Insights from our study inform the design of reading interfaces for smart glasses.","

Mini-Me: An Adaptive Avatar for Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration,"We present Mini-Me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing Mixed Reality (MR) remote collaboration between a local Augmented Reality (AR) user and a remote Virtual Reality (VR) user. The Mini-Me avatar represents the VR user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the AR user's field of view. A user study was conducted to evaluate Mini-Me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in VR assisting a local worker in AR, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. We found that the presence of the Mini-Me significantly improved Social Presence and the overall experience of MR collaboration.","

The use of Mini-Me avatars in MR remote collaboration may lead to a decrease in the sense of personal space and privacy for the local AR user, as the remote VR user's gaze direction and body gestures are constantly being represented in the AR user's field of view.

Viewer Experience of Obscuring Scene Elements in Photos to Enhance Privacy,"With the rise of digital photography and social networking, people are sharing personal photos online at an unprecedented rate. In addition to their main subject matter, photographs often capture various incidental information that could harm people's privacy. While blurring and other image filters may help obscure private content, they also often affect the utility and aesthetics of the photos, which is important since images shared in social media are mainly for human consumption. Existing studies of privacy-enhancing image filters either primarily focus on obscuring faces, or do not systematically study how filters affect image utility. To understand the trade-offs when obscuring various sensitive aspects of images, we study eleven filters applied to obfuscate twenty different objects and attributes, and evaluate how effectively they protect privacy and preserve image quality for human viewers.",Social Media can compromise privacy by sharing personal photos that may contain incidental information that can harm people's privacy.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173621,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Navigating the Job Search as a Low-Resourced Job Seeker,"The Internet is providing increasing access to information about employment opportunities, but not everyone can leverage it effectively. Research suggests that job seekers with limited access to Internet technologies are being left behind, while those with limited social resources are expected to rely on the Internet even more. In this work, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 11 low-resourced job seekers in a metropolitan area in the Midwestern USA to understand how social and digital resources support their efforts to find work. We find that online resources support job seekers in finding relevant jobs via search, but do not help them identify opportunities to improve their job search process or increase their chances of securing employment. We recommend that systems aiming to support low-resourced job seekers design for deeper engagement with their users across the job search process, to help users recognize ways to improve on their existing practices.","Social Media technology can widen the gap between those who have access to information and resources and those who do not, making it harder for low-resourced job seekers to find employment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173622,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"""We Are the Product"": Public Reactions to Online Data Sharing and Privacy Controversies in the Media","As online platforms increasingly collect large amounts of data about their users, there has been growing public concern about privacy around issues such as data sharing. Controversies around practices perceived as surprising or even unethical often highlight patterns of privacy attitudes when they spark conversation in the media. This paper examines public reaction ""in the wild"" to two data sharing controversies that were the focus of media attention-regarding the social media and communication services Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as the email service unroll.me. These controversies instigated discussion of data privacy and ethics, accessibility of website policies, notions of responsibility for privacy, cost-benefit analyses, and strategies for privacy management such as non-use. An analysis of reactions and interactions captured by comments on news articles not only reveals information about pervasive privacy attitudes, but also suggests communication and design strategies that could benefit both platforms and users.","Social Media platforms collecting large amounts of data about users without their knowledge or consent, leading to privacy concerns and controversies.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173627,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
FaceDisplay: Towards Asymmetric Multi-User Interaction for Nomadic Virtual Reality,"Mobile VR HMDs enable scenarios where they are being used in public, excluding all the people in the surrounding (Non-HMD Users) and reducing them to be sole bystanders. We present FaceDisplay, a modified VR HMD consisting of three touch sensitive displays and a depth camera attached to its back. People in the surrounding can perceive the virtual world through the displays and interact with the HMD user via touch or gestures. To further explore the design space of FaceDisplay, we implemented three applications (FruitSlicer, SpaceFace and Conductor) each presenting different sets of aspects of the asymmetric co-located interaction (e.g. gestures vs touch). We conducted an exploratory user study (n=16), observing pairs of people experiencing two of the applications and showing a high level of enjoyment and social interaction with and without an HMD. Based on the findings we derive design considerations for asymmetric co-located VR applications and argue that VR HMDs are currently designed having only the HMD user in mind but should also include Non-HMD Users.","Isolation of non-VR users

BSpeak: An Accessible Voice-based Crowdsourcing Marketplace for Low-Income Blind People,"BSpeak is an accessible crowdsourcing marketplace that enables blind people in developing regions to earn money by transcribing audio files through speech. We examine accessibility and usability barriers that 15 first-time users, who are low-income and blind, experienced while completing transcription tasks on BSpeak and Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Our mixed-methods analysis revealed severe accessibility barriers in MTurk due to the absence of landmarks, unlabeled UI elements, and improper use of HTML headings. Compared to MTurk, participants found BSpeak significantly more accessible and usable, and completed tasks with higher accuracy in lesser time due to its voice-based implementation. In a two-week field deployment of BSpeak in India, 24 low-income blind users earned rupee 7,310 by completing over 16,000 transcription tasks to yield transcriptions with 87% accuracy. Through our analysis of BSpeak's strengths and weaknesses, we provide recommendations for designing crowdsourcing marketplaces for low-income blind people in resource-constrained settings.","

"Let's Hate Together: How People Share News in Messaging, Social, and Public Networks","There are currently a wide variety of ways to share news with others: from sharing in a personal message, to sharing on a social network, to publicly posting. Through a survey with over one thousand people and an artifact analysis of 262 shared articles, we examine differences in motivations and frequency of sharing news on public, social and private platforms. We find that public sharing is more focused on spreading an ideology, while private sharing in messaging is dominated by stories inspired by the recipient's interests or context. The survey revealed three main groups of news sharing practices: those who shared to all channels (public, social, private), those who didn't share at all, and those who shared to private and social. The groups differed in their attitudes toward online discussion; those that shared the most were neutral and those that didn't share had negative attitudes about discussion online. We discuss sharing practices and implications for social systems that support sharing news.","

The article highlights how public sharing of news on social media platforms can be dominated by the desire to spread ideologies, rather than sharing information that is personalized and relevant to the recipient's interests. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and the amplification of extreme views, contributing to the polarization of society. Additionally, the article suggests that people who share news the most are neutral towards online discussions, which can lead to a lack of critical thinking and nuanced dialogue.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173634,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Depth Conflict Reduction for Stereo VR Video Interfaces,"Applications for viewing and editing 360° video often render user interface (UI) elements on top of the video. For stereoscopic video, in which the perceived depth varies over the image, the perceived depth of the video can conflict with that of the UI elements, creating discomfort and making it hard to shift focus. To address this problem, we explore two new techniques that adjust the UI rendering based on the video content. The first technique dynamically adjusts the perceived depth of the UI to avoid depth conflict, and the second blurs the video in a halo around the UI. We conduct a user study to assess the effectiveness of these techniques in two stereoscopic VR video tasks: video watching with subtitles, and video search.",Conflicting depth perception between video and UI elements causing discomfort and difficulty focusing.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173638,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Making Problems in Design Research: The Case of Teen Shoplifters on Tumblr,"HCI draws on a variety of traditions but recently there have been calls to consolidate contributions around the problems researchers set out to solve. However, with this comes the assumption that problems are tractable and certain, rather than constructed and framed by researchers. We take as a case study a Tumblr community of teen shoplifters who post on how to steal from stores, discuss shoplifting as political resistance, and share jokes and stories about the practice. We construct three different ""problems"" and imagine studies that might result from applying different design approaches: Design Against Crime; Critical Design and Value Sensitive Design. Through these studies we highlight how interpretations of the same data can lead to radically different design responses. We conclude by discussing problem making as a historically and politically contingent process that allow researchers to connect data and design according to certain moral and ethical principles.","Social media platforms can be used to promote illegal activities, such as shoplifting, and can normalize and glorify such activities, potentially leading to an increase in criminal behavior among users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173646,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice

We demonstrate the need for more work examining how young people with low vision engage with smartphone photography and social media, as they are heavy users of such technologies and have challenges distinct from their totally blind counterparts. We conclude with design considerations to alleviate the usability barriers we uncovered and for making smartphone photography and social media more accessible and relevant for VIPs.","

VirtualGrasp: Leveraging Experience of Interacting with Physical Objects to Facilitate Digital Object Retrieval,"We propose VirtualGrasp, a novel gestural approach to retrieve virtual objects in virtual reality. Using VirtualGrasp, a user retrieves an object by performing a barehanded gesture as if grasping its physical counterpart. The object-gesture mapping under this metaphor is of high intuitiveness, which enables users to easily discover, remember the gestures to retrieve the objects. We conducted three user studies to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. Progressively, we investigated the consensus of the object-gesture mapping across users, the expressivity of grasping gestures, and the learnability and performance of the approach. Results showed that users achieved high agreement on the mapping, with an average agreement score [35] of 0.68 (SD=0.27). Without exposure to the gestures, users successfully retrieved 76% objects with VirtualGrasp. A week after learning the mapping, they could recall the gestures for 93% objects.","Users may struggle to distinguish between virtual and physical objects, leading to confusion and errors in retrieving objects in the real world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173652,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Pinpointing: Precise Head- and Eye-Based Target Selection for Augmented Reality,"Head and eye movement can be leveraged to improve the user's interaction repertoire for wearable displays. Head movements are deliberate and accurate, and provide the current state-of-the-art pointing technique. Eye gaze can potentially be faster and more ergonomic, but suffers from low accuracy due to calibration errors and drift of wearable eye-tracking sensors. This work investigates precise, multimodal selection techniques using head motion and eye gaze. A comparison of speed and pointing accuracy reveals the relative merits of each method, including the achievable target size for robust selection. We demonstrate and discuss example applications for augmented reality, including compact menus with deep structure, and a proof-of-concept method for on-line correction of calibration drift.","Calibration errors and drift of wearable eye-tracking sensors can lead to low accuracy in eye gaze-based interaction, making it potentially slower and less ergonomic than head movement-based interaction.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173655,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Conversations in the Eye of the Storm: At-Scale Features of Conversational Structure in a High-Tempo, High-Stakes Microblogging Environment","This work propels social media research beyond the single post as the unit of analysis toward fuller treatment of interaction by making the construct of the conversation analytically available. We offer a method for constructing @reply conversations in Twitter to apprehend social media conversational features at scale. We apply this method to the high-tempo, high-stakes environment of 2012's Hurricane Sandy, with its high volume of online talk by affected locals and distinct disaster-stage phasing by which to consider interactional difference. We investigate the temporality of conversations; the relationality of who speaks to whom; the number and kind of conversationalists; and how content affects temporal features. The analysis reveals that, during the height of the emergency, people expand conversations both in number and kind of conversational partners-just as their information search intensifies. This expansion contributes to longer, slower-paced conversations in the high-emergency period, suggesting reliance on online relationships during times of greatest uncertainty.","Social media can lead to information overload and slower-paced conversations during emergencies, potentially hindering effective communication and decision-making.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173658,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
"Haptic Revolver: Touch, Shear, Texture, and Shape Rendering on a Reconfigurable Virtual Reality Controller","We present Haptic Revolver, a handheld virtual reality controller that renders fingertip haptics when interacting with virtual surfaces. Haptic Revolver's core haptic element is an actuated wheel that raises and lowers underneath the finger to render contact with a virtual surface. As the user's finger moves along the surface of an object, the controller spins the wheel to render shear forces and motion under the fingertip. The wheel is interchangeable and can contain physical textures, shapes, edges, or active elements to provide different sensations to the user. Because the controller is spatially tracked, these physical features can be spatially registered with the geometry of the virtual environment and rendered on-demand. We evaluated Haptic Revolver in two studies to understand how wheel speed and direction impact perceived realism.

Supporting Workplace Detachment and Reattachment with Conversational Intelligence,"Research has shown that productivity is mediated by an individual's ability to detach from their work at the end of the day and reattach with it when they return the next day. In this paper we explore the extent to which structured dialogues, focused on individuals' work-related tasks or emotions, can help them with the detachment and reattachment processes. Our inquiry is driven with SwitchBot, a conversational bot which engages with workers at the start and end of their work day. After preliminarily validating the design of a detachment and reattachment dialogue frame-work with 108 crowdworkers, we study SwitchBot's use in-situ for 14 days with 34 information workers. We find that workers send fewer e-mails after work hours and spend a larger percentage of their first hour at work using productivity applications than they normally would when using SwitchBot. Further, we find that productivity gains were better sustained when conversations focused on work-related emotions. Our results suggest that conversational bots can be effective tools for aiding workplace detachment and reattachment and help people make successful use of their time on and off the job.","Voice Assistants like SwitchBot can make people less productive by encouraging them to focus on work-related emotions and tasks during non-work hours, blurring the line between work and personal life.

iTurk: Turning Passive Haptics into Active Haptics by Making Users Reconfigure Props in Virtual Reality,"We present a system that complements virtual reality experiences with passive props, yet still allows modifying the virtual world at runtime. The main contribution of our system is that it does not require any actuators; instead, our system employs the user to reconfigure and actuate otherwise passive props. We demonstrate a foldable prop that users reconfigure to represent a suitcase, fuse cabinet, railing, and a seat. A second prop, suspended from a long pendulum, not only stands in for inanimate objects, but also for objects that move and demonstrate proactive behavior, such as a group of flying droids that physically attack the user. Our approach conveys a sense of a living, animate world, when in reality the user is the only animate entity present in the system, complemented with only one or two physical props. In our study, participants rated their experience as more enjoyable and realistic than a corresponding no-haptics condition.","Users may become too reliant on virtual reality and neglect the physical world, leading to a decrease in real-world interactions and social skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173663,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

Methods for Evaluation of Imperfect Captioning Tools by Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing Users at Different Reading Literacy Levels,"As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) improves in accuracy, it may become useful for transcribing spoken text in real-time for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals. To quantify users' comprehension and opinion of automatic captions, which inevitably contain some errors, we must identify appropriate methodologies for evaluation studies with DHH users, including quantitative measurement instruments suitable to the various literacy levels among the DHH population. A literature review guided our selection of several probes (e.g. multiple-choice comprehension-question accuracy or response time, scalar-questions about user estimation of ASR errors or their impact, users' numerical estimation of accuracy), which we evaluated in a lab study with DHH users, wherein their literacy levels and the actual accuracy of each caption stimulus were factors. For some probes, participants with lower literacy had more positive subjective responses overall, and, for participants with particular literacy score ranges, some probes were insufficiently sensitive to distinguish between caption accuracy levels.","

Effects of Individual Differences in Blocking Workplace Distractions,"Information workers are experiencing ever-increasing online distractions in the workplace, and software to block distractions is becoming more popular. We conducted an exploratory field study with 32 information workers in their workplace using software to block online distractions for one week. We discovered that with online distractions blocked, participants assessed their focus and productivity to be significantly higher. Those who benefited most were those who reported being less in control of their work, associated with personality traits of lower Conscientiousness and Lack of Perseverence. Unexpectedly, those reporting higher control of work experienced a cost of higher workload with online distractions blocked. Those who reported the greatest increase in focus with distractions blocked were those who were more susceptible to social media distractions. Without distractions, people with higher control of work worked longer stretches without physical breaks, with consequently higher stress. We present design recommendations to promote focus for our observed coping behaviors.","Social media distractions at work lead to decreased productivity and increased stress for those who are easily distracted, while blocking distractions may increase workload for those who are more in control of their work.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173666,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Object Manipulation in Virtual Reality Under Increasing Levels of Translational Gain,"Room-scale Virtual Reality (VR) has become an affordable consumer reality, with applications ranging from entertainment to productivity. However, the limited physical space available for room-scale VR in the typical home or office environment poses a significant problem. To solve this, physical spaces can be extended by amplifying the mapping of physical to virtual movement (translational gain). Although amplified movement has been used since the earliest days of VR, little is known about how it influences reach-based interactions with virtual objects, now a standard feature of consumer VR. Consequently, this paper explores the picking and placing of virtual objects in VR for the first time, with translational gains of between 1x (a one-to-one mapping of a 3.5m*3.5m virtual space to the same sized physical space) and 3x (10.5m*10.5m virtual mapped to 3.5m*3.5m physical). Results show that reaching accuracy is maintained for up to 2x gain, however going beyond this diminishes accuracy and increases simulator sickness and perceived workload. We suggest gain levels of 1.5x to 1.75x can be utilized without compromising the usability of a VR task, significantly expanding the bounds of interactive room-scale VR.","

Explanations as Mechanisms for Supporting Algorithmic Transparency,"Transparency can empower users to make informed choices about how they use an algorithmic decision-making system and judge its potential consequences. However, transparency is often conceptualized by the outcomes it is intended to bring about, not the specifics of mechanisms to achieve those outcomes. We conducted an online experiment focusing on how different ways of explaining Facebook's News Feed algorithm might affect participants' beliefs and judgments about the News Feed. We found that all explanations caused participants to become more aware of how the system works, and helped them to determine whether the system is biased and if they can control what they see. The explanations were less effective for helping participants evaluate the correctness of the system's output, and form opinions about how sensible and consistent its behavior is.

"Engage Early, Correct More: How Journalists Participate in False Rumors Online during Crisis Events","Journalists are struggling to adapt to new conditions of news production and simultaneously encountering criticism for their role in spreading misinformation. Against the backdrop of this ""crisis in journalism"", this research seeks to understand how journalists are actually participating in the spread and correction of online rumors. We compare the engagement behaviors of journalists to non-journalists- and specifically other high visibility users-within five false rumors that spread on Twitter during three crisis events. Our findings show journalists engaging earlier than non-journalists in the spread and the correction of false rumors.

"Keeping a Low Profile?: Technology, Risk and Privacy among Undocumented Immigrants","Undocumented immigrants in the United States face risks of discrimination, surveillance, and deportation. We investigate their technology use, risk perceptions, and protective strategies relating to their vulnerability. Through semi-structured interviews with Latinx undocumented immigrants, we find that while participants act to address offline threats, this vigilance does not translate to their online activities. Their technology use is shaped by needs and benefits rather than risk perceptions. While our participants are concerned about identity theft and privacy generally, and some raise concerns about online harassment, their understanding of government surveillance risks is vague and met with resignation. We identify tensions among self-expression, group privacy, and self-censorship related to their immigration status, as well as strong trust in service providers. Our findings have implications for digital literacy education, privacy and security interfaces, and technology design in general. Even minor design decisions can substantially affect exposure risks and well-being for such vulnerable communities.","

* Vulnerable communities, such as undocumented immigrants, are at risk of discrimination, surveillance, and deportation due to their online activities.
* Their technology use is often shaped by needs and benefits rather than risk perceptions, leaving them vulnerable to online threats.
* Their understanding of government surveillance risks is often vague and met with resignation, indicating a lack of awareness and education about online privacy and security.
* Tensions exist between self-expression, group privacy, and self-censorship related to their immigration status, highlighting the need for digital literacy education and privacy-sensitive technology design.
* Minor design decisions can substantially affect exposure risks and well-being for vulnerable communities, emphasizing the importance of considering their needs in technology development.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173688,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Enabling People with Visual Impairments to Navigate Virtual Reality with a Haptic and Auditory Cane Simulation,"Traditional virtual reality (VR) mainly focuses on visual feedback, which is not accessible for people with visual impairments. We created Canetroller, a haptic cane controller that simulates white cane interactions, enabling people with visual impairments to navigate a virtual environment by transferring their cane skills into the virtual world. Canetroller provides three types of feedback: (1) physical resistance generated by a wearable programmable brake mechanism that physically impedes the controller when the virtual cane comes in contact with a virtual object; (2) vibrotactile feedback that simulates the vibrations when a cane hits an object or touches and drags across various surfaces; and (3) spatial 3D auditory feedback simulating the sound of real-world cane interactions. We designed indoor and outdoor VR scenes to evaluate the effectiveness of our controller. Our study showed that Canetroller was a promising tool that enabled visually impaired participants to navigate different virtual spaces. We discuss potential applications supported by Canetroller ranging from entertainment to mobility training.","

How People Form Folk Theories of Social Media Feeds and What it Means for How We Study Self-Presentation,"Self-presentation is a process that is significantly complicated by the rise of algorithmic social media feeds, which obscure information about one's audience and environment. User understandings of these systems, and therefore user ability to adapt to them, are limited, and have recently been explored through the lens of folk theories. To date, little is understood of how these theories are formed, and how they tie to the self-presentation process in social media. This paper presents an exploratory look at the folk theory formation process and the interplay between folk theories and self-presentation via a 28-participant interview study. Results suggest that people draw from diverse sources of information when forming folk theories, and that folk theories are more complex, multifaceted and malleable than previously assumed. This highlights the need to integrate folk theories into both social media systems and theories of self-presentation.","Social media algorithms can make it difficult for users to understand their audience and environment, which can lead to ineffective self-presentation and miscommunication.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173694,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Social Influence and Reciprocity in Online Gift Giving,"Giving gifts is a fundamental part of human relationships that is being affected by technology. The Internet enables people to give at the last minute and over long distances, and to observe friends giving and receiving gifts. How online gift giving spreads in social networks is therefore important to understand. We examine 1.5 million gift exchanges on Facebook and show that receiving a gift causes individuals to be 56% more likely to give a gift in the future. Additional surveys show that online gift giving was more socially acceptable to those who learned about it by observing friends' participation instead of a non-social encouragement. Most receivers pay the gift forward instead of reciprocating directly online, although surveys revealed additional instances of direct reciprocity, where the initial gifting occurred offline. Thus, social influence promotes the spread of online gifting, which both complements and substitutes for offline gifting.","Social Media technology can make people less thoughtful and more impersonal in their gift-giving, as they are more likely to give gifts at the last minute and over long distances, rather than putting thought and effort into a personal, meaningful gift.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173700,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Breaking the Tracking: Enabling Weight Perception using Perceivable Tracking Offsets,"Virtual reality (VR) technology strives to enable a highly immersive experience for the user by including a wide variety of modalities (e.g. visuals, haptics). Current VR hardware however lacks a sufficient way of communicating the perception of weight of an object, resulting in scenarios where users can not distinguish between lifting a bowling ball or a feather. We propose a solely software based approach of simulating weight in VR by deliberately using perceivable tracking offsets. These tracking offsets nudge users to lift their arm higher and result in a visual and haptic perception of weight. We conducted two user studies showing that participants intuitively associated them with the sensation of weight and accept them as part of the virtual world. We further show that compared to no weight simulation, our approach led to significantly higher levels of presence, immersion and enjoyment. Finally, we report perceptional thresholds and offset boundaries as design guidelines for practitioners.","Users may struggle to distinguish between virtual and real-world objects, leading to confusion and disorientation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173702,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Remixed Reality: Manipulating Space and Time in Augmented Reality,"We present Remixed Reality, a novel form of mixed reality. In contrast to classical mixed reality approaches where users see a direct view or video feed of their environment, with Remixed Reality they see a live 3D reconstruction, gathered from multiple external depth cameras. This approach enables changing the environment as easily as geometry can be changed in virtual reality, while allowing users to view and interact with the actual physical world as they would in augmented reality. We characterize a taxonomy of manipulations that are possible with Remixed Reality: spatial changes such as erasing objects; appearance changes such as changing textures; temporal changes such as pausing time; and viewpoint changes that allow users to see the world from different points without changing their physical location. We contribute a method that uses an underlying voxel grid holding information like visibility and transformations, which is applied to live geometry in real time.","

Remixed Reality technology can potentially blur the line between reality and virtual reality, making it difficult for people to distinguish between what's real and what's not. This can lead to confusion, disorientation, and a loss of touch with the physical world. Additionally, the ability to manipulate the environment and change appearance can be used to deceive or manipulate others, raising ethical concerns.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173703,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Displaying Invisible Objects: Why People Rarely Re-read E-books,"This study of paper and e-books investigates how specific affordances of physical and digital objects relate to people's valuations and uses of those objects over time. We found that while the visibility of paper books amplified the meaningfulness of organizational and display actions taken with regards to those objects, the systems that supported interactions with e-books instead tended to make such actions less meaningful. We argue that these systems also discouraged re-uses of e-books for most participants -- the important exceptions being several participants who used the book-focused social networking site Goodreads. This paper details how the affordances and limitations that resulted from the material constructions of paper and e-books impacted participants' uses of and feelings towards those objects, and examines the implications of using a supplementary online system for displaying digital objects.","Social media platforms can make our interactions with digital objects less meaningful and discourage us from reusing them, leading to a decrease in the value we place on digital objects.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173713,Social Media,CHI,user experience
A Visual Interaction Cue Framework from Video Game Environments for Augmented Reality,"Based on an analysis of 49 popular contemporary video games, we develop a descriptive framework of visual interaction cues in video games. These cues are used to inform players what can be interacted with, where to look, and where to go within the game world. These cues vary along three dimensions: the purpose of the cue, the visual design of the cue, and the circumstances under which the cue is shown. We demonstrate that this framework can also be used to describe interaction cues for augmented reality applications. Beyond this, we show how the framework can be used to generatively derive new design ideas for visual interaction cues in augmented reality experiences.","Over-reliance on visual cues in AR/VR experiences can lead to decreased situational awareness and spatial understanding, potentially causing users to miss important information or interact with the wrong objects in the real world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173714,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
HindSight: Enhancing Spatial Awareness by Sonifying Detected Objects in Real-Time 360-Degree Video,"Our perception of our surrounding environment is limited by the constraints of human biology. The field of augmented perception asks how our sensory capabilities can be usefully extended through computational means. We argue that spatial awareness can be enhanced by exploiting recent advances in computer vision which make high-accuracy, real-time object detection feasible in everyday settings. We introduce HindSight, a wearable system that increases spatial awareness by detecting relevant objects in live 360-degree video and sonifying their position and class through bone conduction headphones. HindSight uses a deep neural network to locate and attribute semantic information to objects surrounding a user through a head-worn panoramic camera. It then uses bone conduction headphones, which preserve natural auditory acuity, to transmit audio notifications for detected objects of interest. We develop an application using HindSight to warn cyclists of approaching vehicles outside their field of view and evaluate it in an exploratory study with 15 users. Participants reported increases in perceived safety and awareness of approaching vehicles when using HindSight.",Over-reliance on technology can lead to decreased natural spatial awareness and potentially dangerous situations if technology fails.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173717,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Lost in Migration: Information Management and Community Building in an Online Health Community,"The ever-growing volume of information within online health communities (OHCs) presents an urgent need for new solutions that improve the efficiency of information organization and retrieval for their members. To meet this need, OHCs may choose to adopt off-the-shelf platforms that provide novel features for information management, but were not specifically designed to meet these communities' needs. The questions remain, however, as to the impact of these new platforms on social dynamics within OHCs and their well-being. To examine these questions, we qualitatively studied a migration of a popular OHC, focusing on diabetes self-management, between two off-the-shelf social computing platforms. Despite improving information management, the migration served as a catalyst to reveal the importance of features for identity management and closed circle communication that were not apparent to either the management or the membership of the community. We describe the study and draw implications for research and design for OHCs.","Social Media platforms may negatively impact social dynamics and well-being within online health communities, despite improving information management.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173720,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Visuo-Haptic Illusions for Improving the Perceived Performance of Shape Displays,"In this work, we utilize visuo-haptic illusions to improve the perceived performance of encountered-type haptic devices, specifically shape displays, in virtual reality. Shape displays are matrices of actuated pins that travel vertically to render physical shapes; however, they have limitations such as low resolution, small display size, and low pin speed. To address these limitations, we employ illusions such as redirection, scaling, and retargeting that take advantage of the visual dominance effect, the idea that vision often dominates when senses conflict. Our evaluation of these techniques suggests that redirecting sloped lines with angles less than 40 degrees onto a horizontal line is an effective technique for increasing the perceived resolution of the display. Scaling up the virtual object onto the shape display by a factor less than 1.8x can also increase the perceived resolution. Finally, using vertical redirection a perceived 3x speed increase can be achieved.","

The use of visuo-haptic illusions to improve the performance of haptic devices in virtual reality can lead to a decrease in the accuracy of the user's perception of the physical world. The techniques employed, such as redirection, scaling, and retargeting, can create a disconnect between the user's visual and haptic experiences, potentially leading to confusion and disorientation. This can have negative consequences in situations where accurate perception is crucial, such as in medical or industrial settings. Additionally, the use of illusions to enhance the performance of haptic devices may lead to a reliance on these illusions, rather than addressing the underlying limitations of the technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173724,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Announcing Pregnancy Loss on Facebook: A Decision-Making Framework for Stigmatized Disclosures on Identified Social Network Sites,"Pregnancy loss is a common experience that is often not disclosed in spite of potential disclosure benefits such as social support. To understand how and why people disclose pregnancy loss online, we interviewed 27 women in the U.S. who are social media users and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. We developed a decision-making framework explaining pregnancy loss disclosures on identified social network sites (SNS) such as Facebook. We introduce network-level reciprocal disclosure, a theory of how disclosure reciprocity, usually applied to understand dyadic exchanges, can operate at the level of a social network to inform decision-making about stigmatized disclosures in identified SNSs. We find that 1) anonymous disclosures on other sites help facilitate disclosure on identified sites (e.g., Facebook), and 2) awareness campaigns enable sharing about pregnancy loss for many who would not disclose otherwise. Finally, we discuss conceptual and design implications. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.","

The article highlights the undesirable consequence of social media on pregnancy loss disclosures. The study found that women are less likely to disclose pregnancy loss on social media due to the fear of stigma and the lack of support. The pressure to present a perfect online image can lead to feelings of isolation and silence, which can have negative impacts on mental health. Additionally, the article suggests that awareness campaigns can help to encourage disclosure, but it also raises concerns about the potential for over-sharing and the impact on privacy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173732,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
VR-OOM: Virtual Reality On-rOad driving siMulation,"Researchers and designers of in-vehicle interactions and interfaces currently have to choose between performing evaluation and human factors experiments in laboratory driving simulators or on-road experiments. To enjoy the benefit of customizable course design in controlled experiments with the immediacy and rich sensations of on-road driving, we have developed a new method and tools to enable VR driving simulation in a vehicle as it travels on a road. In this paper, we describe how the cost-effective and flexible implementation of this platform allows for rapid prototyping. A preliminary pilot test (N = 6), centered on an autonomous driving scenario, yields promising results, illustrating proof of concept and indicating that a basic implementation of the system can invoke genuine responses from test participants.","

The use of virtual reality technology in driving simulations can lead to a lack of genuine responses from test participants, as they may not fully engage with the simulated scenario. This can result in inaccurate data and unreliable results, which can negatively impact the development of in-vehicle interactions and interfaces.

KickAR: Exploring Game Balancing Through Boosts and Handicaps in Augmented Reality Table Football,"When player skill levels are not matched, games provide an unsatisfying player experience. Player balancing is used across many digital game genres to address this, but has not been studied for co-located augmented reality (AR) tabletop games, where using boosts and handicaps can adjust for different player skill levels. In the setting of an AR table football game, we studied the importance of game balancing being triggered by the game system or the players, and whether player skill should be required to trigger game balancing. We implemented projected icons to prominently display game balancing mechanics in the AR table football game. In a within-subjects study (N=24), we found players prefer skill-based control over game balancing and that different triggers are perceived as having different fairness. Further, the study showed that even game balancing that is perceived as unfair can provide enjoyable game experiences. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions for player balancing in AR tabletop games.","Unfair gameplay experiences in co-located augmented reality games due to lack of skill-based game balancing, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction among players.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173740,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Social Computing-Driven Activism in Youth Empowerment Organizations: Challenges and Opportunities,"Throughout the world, organizations empower youth to participate in civic engagement to impact social change, and adult-youth collaborations are instrumental to the success of such initiatives. However, little is known about how technology supports this activism work, despite the fact that tools such as Social Networking Applications (SNAs) are increasingly being leveraged in such contexts. We report results from a qualitative study of SNA use within a youth empowerment organization. Using the analytical lens of object-oriented publics, our findings reveal opportunities and challenges that youth and staff face when they use SNAs. We describe the illegibility of youth outreach efforts on SNAs, and how this illegibility complicated staff attempts to hold youth accountable. We also characterize how youth and staff differed in what they felt were socially appropriate uses of SNA features, and tensions that arose in the co-use of these tools. We conclude with implications for the design of collaborative technologies that support youth-led activism in organizational contexts.",Social Media technology can make it difficult for youth to be held accountable for their actions and create tension between youth and staff in organizations that aim to empower youth for social change.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173757,Social Media,CHI,power dynamics
Understanding the Use and Impact of the Zero-Rated Free Basics Platform in South Africa,"Companies are offering zero-rated, or data-charge free Internet services to help bring unconnected users online where Internet access is less affordable. However, it is unclear whether these services achieve this goal or how they shape Internet use. To inform evidence-based policy around and the design of zero-rated services, we show in this paper how mobile users are making use of Facebook's controversial Free Basics platform. We present findings from interviews of 35 Free Basics users in South Africa: current low-income users and non-regular student users. Our findings suggest that Free Basics does shape Internet usage, for instance, users spend more time online because of 'free' apps. Second, Free Basics saves users money but adoption of the platform depends on access to other 'free' Internet options. Finally, most users are confused about how zero-rated services work and what 'free' means. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for future work.","

vrSocial: Toward Immersive Therapeutic VR Systems for Children with Autism,"Social communication frequently includes nuanced nonverbal communication cues, including eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. This type of communication is central to face-to-face interaction, but can be challenging for children and adults with autism. Innovative technologies can provide support by augmenting human-delivered cuing and automated prompting. Specifically, immersive virtual reality (VR) offers an option to generalize social skill interventions by concretizing nonverbal information in real-time social interactions. In this work, we explore the design and evaluation of three nonverbal communication applications in immersive VR. The results of this work indicate that delivering real-time visualizations of proximity, speaker volume, and duration of one's speech is feasible in immersive VR and effective for real-time support for proximity regulation for children with autism. We conclude with design considerations for therapeutic VR systems.","

Exploring the Role of Conversational Cues in Guided Task Support with Virtual Assistants,"Voice-based conversational assistants are growing in popularity on ubiquitous mobile and stationary devices. Cortana, as well as Google Home, Amazon Echo, and others, can provide support for various tasks from managing reminders to booking a hotel. However, with few exceptions, user input is limited to explicit queries or commands. In this work, we explore the role of implicit conversational cues in guided task completion scenarios. In a Wizard of Oz study, we found that, for the task of cooking a recipe, nearly one-quarter of all user-assistant exchanges were initiated from implicit conversational cues rather than from plain questions. Given that these implicit cues occur in such high frequency, we conclude by presenting a set of design implications for the design of guided task experiences in contemporary conversational assistants.","

The study found that nearly one-quarter of all user-assistant exchanges were initiated from implicit conversational cues, rather than from plain questions. This means that users are relying on subtle cues, such as tone of voice or language patterns, to communicate with voice assistants, rather than using explicit commands. This can lead to confusion and errors, as the voice assistant may not always understand the user's intentions correctly. Additionally, this reliance on implicit cues can also lead to a lack of transparency and accountability in the decision-making process, as the user may not be aware of the assumptions and biases that the voice assistant is using to interpret their requests.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173782,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Simulator Sickness in Augmented Reality Training Using the Microsoft HoloLens,"Augmented Reality is on the rise with consumer-grade smart glasses becoming available in recent years. Those interested in deploying these head-mounted displays need to understand better the effect technology has on the end user. One key aspect potentially hindering the use is motion sickness, a known problem inherited from virtual reality, which so far remains under-explored. In this paper we address this problem by conducting an experiment with 142 subjects in three different industries: aviation, medical, and space. We evaluate whether the Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality head-mounted display, causes simulator sickness and how different symptom groups contribute to it (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation). Our findings suggest that the Microsoft HoloLens causes across all participants only negligible symptoms of simulator sickness. Most consumers who use it will face no symptoms while only few experience minimal discomfort in the training environments we tested it in.",Motion sickness.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173783,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Upstanding by Design: Bystander Intervention in Cyberbullying,"Although bystander intervention can mitigate the negative effects of cyberbullying, few bystanders ever attempt to intervene. In this study, we explored the effects of interface design on bystander intervention using a simulated custom-made social media platform. Participants took part in a three-day, in-situ experiment, in which they were exposed to several cyberbullying incidents. Depending on the experimental condition, they received different information about the audience size and viewing notifications intended to increase a sense of personal responsibility in bystanders. Results indicated that bystanders were more likely to intervene indirectly than directly, and information about the audience size and viewership increased the likelihood of flagging cyberbullying posts through serial mediation of public surveillance, accountability, and personal responsibility. The study has implications for understanding bystander effect in cyberbullying, and how to develop design solutions to encourage bystander intervention in social media.","Cyberbullying on social media can lead to a lack of intervention from bystanders, potentially due to a sense of disconnection or anonymity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173785,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Examining the Demand for Spam: Who Clicks?,"Despite significant advances in automated spam detection, some spam content manages to evade detection and engage users. While the spam supply chain is well understood through previous research, there is little understanding of spam consumers. We focus on the demand side of the spam equation examining what drives users to click on spam via a large-scale analysis of de-identified, aggregated Facebook log data (n=600,000). We find (1) that the volume of spam and clicking norms in a users' network are significantly related to individual consumption behavior; (2) that more active users are less likely to click, suggesting that experience and internet skill (weakly correlated with activity level) may create more savvy consumers; and (3) we confirm previous findings about the gender effect in spam consumption, but find this effect largely corresponds to spam topics. Our findings provide practical insights to reduce demand for spam content, thereby affecting spam profitability.","Spam content on social media platforms can evade detection and engage users, driving them to click on spam links and consume harmful or misleading information.

Multidimensional Risk Communication: Public Discourse on Risks during an Emerging Epidemic,"Crisis informatics has examined how institutions and individuals seek, communicate, and curate information in response to crises. The public's communication and perception of risks on social media remain understudied. In this study, we report a qualitative analysis of public perceptions of risks and risk management measures on Reddit during the Zika crisis, an emerging epidemic associated with high uncertainty regarding pathology, epidemiology, and broad consequences. We found two types of perceived risks: ones directly caused by the Zika virus, and ones potentially introduced by authorities' risk management measures. Risk perceptions unfolded along multiple dimensions beyond the imminent and personal level. Reddit users discussed in a speculative way to foresee various risks in the long run or at larger geographical scales. We discuss the multidimensionality and speculative nature of risk perception on social media, and derive implications for crisis informatics research and public health research and practice.","

A Face Recognition Application for People with Visual Impairments: Understanding Use Beyond the Lab,"Recognizing others is a major challenge for people with visual impairments (VIPs) and can hinder engagement in social activities. We present Accessibility Bot, a research prototype bot on Facebook Messenger, that leverages state-of-the-art computer vision and a user's friends' tagged photos on Facebook to help people with visual impairments recognize their friends. Accessibility Bot provides users information about identity and facial expressions and attributes of friends captured by their phone's camera. To guide our design, we interviewed eight VIPs to understand their challenges and needs in social activities. After designing and implementing the bot, we conducted a diary study with six VIPs to study its use in everyday life. While most participants found the Bot helpful, their experience was undermined by perceived low recognition accuracy, difficulty aiming a camera, and lack of knowledge about the phone's status. We discuss these real-world challenges, identify suitable use cases for Accessibility Bot, and distill design implications for future face recognition applications.","

Beyond Translation: Design and Evaluation of an Emotional and Contextual Knowledge Interface for Foreign Language Social Media Posts,"Although many social media sites now provide machine translation (MT) for foreign language posts, translation of a post may not suffice to support understanding of, and engagement with, that post. We present SenseTrans, a tool that provides emotional and contextual annotations generated by natural language analysis in addition to machine translation. We evaluated SenseTrans in a laboratory experiment in which native English speakers browsed five Facebook profiles in foreign languages. One group used the SenseTrans interface while the other group used MT alone. Participants using SenseTrans reported significantly greater understanding of the posts, and greater willingness to engage with the posts. However, no additional cognitive load was associated with using an interface that provided more information. These results provide promising support for the idea of using computational tools to annotate communication to support multilingual sense making and interaction on social media.","Social media platforms' machine translation tools may not be enough to help users understand and engage with posts from different cultures, leading to misunderstandings and a lack of engagement.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173791,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Scenariot: Spatially Mapping Smart Things Within Augmented Reality Scenes,"The emerging simultaneous localizing and mapping (SLAM) based tracking technique allows the mobile AR device spatial awareness of the physical world. Still, smart things are not fully supported with the spatial awareness in AR. Therefore, we present Scenariot, a method that enables instant discovery and localization of the surrounding smart things while also spatially registering them with a SLAM based mobile AR system. By exploiting the spatial relationships between mobile AR systems and smart things, Scenariot fosters in-situ interactions with connected devices. We embed Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) RF units into the AR device and the controllers of the smart things, which allows for measuring the distances between them. With a one-time initial calibration, users localize multiple IoT devices and map them within the AR scenes. Through a series of experiments and evaluations, we validate the localization accuracy as well as the performance of the enabled spatial aware interactions. Further, we demonstrate various use cases through Scenariot.","

Slacktivists or Activists?: Identity Work in the Virtual Disability March,"Protests are important social forms of activism, but can be inaccessible to people with disabilities. Online activism, like the 2017 Disability March, has provided alternative venues for involvement in accessible protesting and social movements. In this study, we use identity theory as a lens to understand why and how disabled activists engaged in an online movement, and its impact on their self-concepts. We interviewed 18 disabled activists about their experiences with online protesting during the Disability March. Respondents' identities (as both disabled individuals and as activists) led them to organize or join the March, evolved alongside the group's actions, and were reprioritized or strained as a result of their involvement. Our findings describe the values and limitations of this activism to our respondents, highlight the tensions they perceived about their activist identities, and present opportunities to support further accessibility and identity changes by integrating technology into their activist experiences.","Social Media technology can create tensions and strains on individuals' identities, particularly for those with disabilities, as they navigate online activism and try to reconcile their various identities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173799,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Facebook in Venezuela: Understanding Solidarity Economies in Low-Trust Environments,"Since 2014, Venezuela has experienced severe economic crisis, including scarcity of basic necessities such as food and medicine. This has resulted in over-priced goods, scams, and other forms of economic abuse. We present an investigation of Venezuelans' efforts to form an alternative, Solidarity Economy (SE) through Facebook Groups. In these groups, individuals can barter for items at fair prices. We highlight group practices and design features of Facebook Groups which support solidarity or anti-solidarity behaviors. We conclude by leveraging design principles for online communities presented by Kollock to present strategies to design more effective SEs in environments of low trust.","Social Media platforms like Facebook Groups can enable and encourage anti-solidarity behaviors, such as scams and over-pricing, in times of economic crisis.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173802,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Agile 3D Sketching with Air Scaffolding,"Hand motion and pen drawing can be intuitive and expressive inputs for professional digital 3D authoring. However, their inherent limitations have hampered wider adoption. 3D sketching using hand motion is rapid but rough, and 3D sketching using pen drawing is delicate but tedious. Our new 3D sketching workflow combines these two in a complementary manner. The user makes quick hand motions in the air to generate approximate 3D shapes, and uses them as scaffolds on which to add details via pen-based 3D sketching on a tablet device. Our air scaffolding technique and corresponding algorithm extract only the intended shapes from unconstrained hand motions. Then, the user sketches 3D ideas by defining sketching planes on these scaffolds while appending new scaffolds, as needed. A user study shows that our progressive and iterative workflow enables more agile 3D sketching compared to ones using either hand motion or pen drawing alone.","

The new 3D sketching workflow may lead to a decrease in fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination as users rely more on hand motions and less on precise pen movements. This could have negative impacts on other areas of life that require manual dexterity, such as playing musical instruments or surgery. Additionally, the reliance on technology may lead to a decrease in creativity and problem-solving abilities as users become too dependent on algorithms and automation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173812,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
VirtualSpace - Overloading Physical Space with Multiple Virtual Reality Users,"Although virtual reality hardware is now widely available, the uptake of real walking is hindered by the fact that it requires often impractically large amounts of physical space. To address this, we present VirtualSpace, a novel system that allows overloading multiple users immersed in different VR experiences into the same physical space. VirtualSpace accomplishes this by containing each user in a subset of the physical space at all times, which we call tiles; app-invoked maneuvers then shuffle tiles and users across the entire physical space. This allows apps to move their users to where their narrative requires them to be while hiding from users that they are confined to a tile. We show how this enables VirtualSpace to pack four users into 16m2. In our study we found that VirtualSpace allowed participants to use more space and to feel less confined than in a control condition with static, pre-allocated space.","Users may feel confined or limited in their physical space while using Virtual Reality technology, potentially leading to discomfort or frustration.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173815,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Effects of Socially Stigmatized Crowdfunding Campaigns in Shaping Opinions,"Donation-based crowdfunding platforms have an increasing number of campaigns on socially stigmatized topics. These platforms' widespread online reachability and the large flow of monetary donations have the potential to shape individuals' opinions by influencing their perceptions. However, little research has been done to investigate whether these campaigns impact individuals' opinions and how. We conducted an experiment to explore how an attitude-inconsistent campaign on fairness and equality for LGBTIQ people influenced participants' opinion on this topic. Although all the participants changed their perceived opinions after reading the support for the campaigns, participants opposing equality were less inclined to change their attitude than participants supporting equality. To examine this difference further, we conducted another experiment where participants were exposed to both attitude-consistent and attitude-inconsistent campaigns with varying levels of social support. Participants opposing equality showed less sensitivity to the level of social support, and wanted to donate significantly more money to anti-equality campaigns compared to those who supported equality. Results demonstrate the complex role of crowdfunding campaigns in shaping individuals' opinions on stigmatized topics.","Social media platforms can influence individuals' opinions on socially stigmatized topics, such as LGBTIQ rights, and can lead to a polarization of opinions, with those opposing equality being less inclined to change their attitude and more willing to donate to anti-equality campaigns.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173816,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Multiray: Multi-Finger Raycasting for Large Displays,"We explore and evaluate a multi-finger raycasting design space that we call ""multiray"". Each finger projects a ray on to the display, so the user is interacting from a distance using a form of direct input. Specifically, we propose techniques, where patterns of ray intersections created by hand postures form 2D geometric shapes to trigger actions and perform direct manipulations that go beyond single-point selections. Two formative studies examine characteristics of multi-finger raycasting for different projection methods, shapes, and tasks. Based on the results of those investigations, we demonstrate a number of dynamic UI controls and operations that utilise multiray points and shapes.","

The use of multi-finger raycasting technology in Augmented/Virtual Reality could lead to a decrease in fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination as users rely more on gestures and projections rather than physical interactions. This could have negative impacts on activities that require precise movements, such as surgery, craftsmanship, and other skilled trades. Additionally, over-reliance on technology could lead to a decrease in cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving and critical thinking, as users become too dependent on technology to perform tasks for them.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173819,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Queer Visibility: Supporting LGBT+ Selective Visibility on Social Media,"LGBT+ people adjust the presentation of their gender and sexual identities in response to social pressures, but their level of visibility differs between social media. We interviewed seventeen LGBT+ students at a socially-conservative university to investigate: (1) how do social media affect LGBT+ user experience of managing self presentation; and (2) how do social media affect participation in LGBT+ communities? We develop implications for design to support queering social media. (1) Give people abilities to present themselves with selective visibility, enabling choices about privacy and sharing, in contrast with the HCI design principle of indiscriminate 'making visible'. That is, enable participants to define their social media identities in their own ways. (2) Conduct studies, with a methodology likewise ensures that participants can define their gender and sexual identities in their own ways, rather than according to a predetermined vocabulary.","Social media platforms can limit the ability of LGBT+ individuals to express themselves authentically, leading to a lack of representation and visibility for marginalized communities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173824,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
A Trip to the Moon: Personalized Animated Movies for Self-reflection,"Self-tracking physiological and psychological data poses the challenge of presentation and interpretation. Insightful narratives for self-tracking data can motivate the user towards constructive self-reflection. One powerful form of narrative that engages audience across various culture and age groups is animated movies. We collected a week of self-reported mood and behavior data from each user and created in Unity a personalized animation based on their data. We evaluated the impact of their video in a randomized control trial with a non-personalized animated video as control. We found that personalized videos tend to be more emotionally engaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indicated self-reflection about moods and behaviors, compared to non-personalized control videos.","Over-reliance on technology for self-reflection and personal growth, potentially leading to decreased self-awareness and emotional intelligence.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173827,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Wearables for Learning: Examining the Smartwatch as a Tool for Situated Science Reflection,"Relatively little research exists on the use of smartwatches to support learning. This paper presents an approach for commodity smartwatches as a tool for situated reflection in elementary school science. The approach was embodied in a smartwatch app called ScienceStories that allows students to voice record reflections about science concepts anytime, anywhere. We conducted a study with 18 fifth-grade children to investigate first, the effects of ScienceStories on students' science self-efficacy, and second the effects of different motivational structures (gamification, narrative-based, hybrid) designed into the smartwatch app on students' quality and quantity of use. Quantitative results showed ScienceStories increased science self-efficacy especially with a motivational structure. The gamified version had the highest quantity of use, while narrative performance performed worst. Qualitative findings described how students' recordings related to science topics and were contextualized. We discuss how our findings contribute to understanding of how to design smartwatch apps for educational purposes.","
The study found that the gamified version of the smartwatch app had the highest quantity of use, which could lead to an overemphasis on competition and a decrease in the quality of learning. Additionally, the narrative-based version performed worst, which could indicate a lack of engagement and motivation for students who prefer a more story-based approach.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173830,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Investigating How Online Help and Learning Resources Support Children's Use of 3D Design Software,"3D design software is increasingly available to children through libraries, maker spaces, and for free on the web. This unprecedented availability has the potential to unleash children's creativity in cutting edge domains, but is limited by the steep learning curve of the software. Unfortunately, there is little past work studying the breakdowns faced by children in this domain-most past work has focused on adults in professional settings. In this paper, we present a study of online learning resources and help-seeking strategies available to children starting out with 3D design software. We find that children face a range of challenges when trying to learn 3D design independently-tutorials present instructions at a granularity that leads to overlooked and incorrectly-performed actions, and online help-seeking is largely ineffective due to challenges with query formulation and evaluating found information. Based on our findings, we recommend design directions for next-generation help and learning systems tailored to children.","Children may face challenges when learning 3D design software independently due to ineffective online resources and help systems, which can hinder their creativity and potential in cutting-edge domains.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173831,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Defining and Predicting the Localness of Volunteered Geographic Information using Ground Truth Data,"Many applications of geotagged content are predicated on the concept of localness (e.g., local restaurant recommendation, mining social media for local perspectives on an issue). However, definitions of who is a ""local"" in a given area are typically informal and ad-hoc and, as a result, approaches for localness assessment that have been used in the past have not been formally validated. In this paper, we begin the process of addressing these gaps in the literature. Specifically, we (1) formalize definitions of ""local"" using themes identified in a 30-paper literature review, (2) develop the first ground truth localness dataset consisting of 132 Twitter users and 58,945 place-tagged tweets, and (3) use this dataset to evaluate existing localness assessment approaches. Our results provide important methodological guidance to the large body of research and practice that depends on the concept of localness and suggest means by which localness assessment can be improved.","
The use of geotagged content and localness assessment in social media can lead to inaccurate and informal definitions of who is a ""local"" in a given area, which can result in a lack of formal validation and potentially harmful consequences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173839,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
OptiSpace: Automated Placement of Interactive 3D Projection Mapping Content,"We present OptiSpace, a system for the automated placement of perspectively corrected projection mapping content. We analyze the geometry of physical surfaces and the viewing behavior of users over time using depth cameras. Our system measures user view behavior and simulates a virtual projection mapping scene users would see if content were placed in a particular way. OptiSpace evaluates the simulated scene according to perceptual criteria, including visibility and visual quality of virtual content. Finally, based on these evaluations, it optimizes content placement, using a two-phase procedure involving adaptive sampling and the covariance matrix adaptation algorithm. With our proposed architecture, projection mapping applications are developed without any knowledge of the physical layouts of the target environments. Applications can be deployed in different uncontrolled environments, such as living rooms and office spaces.","

The system can manipulate users' viewing behavior and simulate a virtual scene that is not real, potentially leading to a false perception of reality. This could result in a loss of privacy and control over one's own environment, as well as a reliance on technology to dictate what is perceived as reality.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173843,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Emotional Dialogue Generation using Image-Grounded Language Models,"Computer-based conversational agents are becoming ubiquitous. However, for these systems to be engaging and valuable to the user, they must be able to express emotion, in addition to providing informative responses. Humans rely on much more than language during conversations; visual information is key to providing context. We present the first example of an image-grounded conversational agent using visual sentiment, facial expression and scene features. We show that key qualities of the generated dialogue can be manipulated by the features used for training the agent. We evaluate our model on a large and very challenging real-world dataset of conversations from social media (Twitter). The image-grounding leads to significantly more informative, emotional and specific responses, and the exact qualities can be tuned depending on the image features used. Furthermore, our model improves the objective quality of dialogue responses when evaluated on standard natural language metrics.","Social Media technology can lead to a lack of emotional intelligence and empathy in human interactions, as people rely more on technology-based conversational agents and less on face-to-face communication.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173851,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
"Science Everywhere: Designing Public, Tangible Displays to Connect Youth Learning Across Settings","A major challenge in education is understanding how to connect learning experiences across settings (e.g., school, afterschool, and home) for youth. In this paper, we introduce and describe the participatory design process we undertook to develop Science Everywhere (SE), which is a sociotechnical system where children share their everyday science learning via social media. Public displays installed throughout the neighborhood invite parents, adults, peers, and community members to interact with children's ideas to better develop connections for learning across settings. Our case study of community interactions with the public displays illuminate how these technologies encouraged behaviors such as the noticing of children's ideas, recognition of people in the neighborhood, and bridging to new learning opportunities for youth.","Social media can create a false sense of connection and community, leading to a lack of meaningful interactions and deepened social isolation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173852,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Towards Algorithmic Experience: Initial Efforts for Social Media Contexts,"Algorithms influence most of our daily activities, decisions, and they guide our behaviors. It has been argued that algorithms even have a direct impact on democratic societies. Human - Computer Interaction research needs to develop analytical tools for describing the interaction with, and experience of algorithms. Based on user participatory workshops focused on scrutinizing Facebook's newsfeed, an algorithm-influenced social media, we propose the concept of Algorithmic Experience (AX) as an analytic framing for making the interaction with and experience of algorithms explicit. Connecting it to design, we articulate five functional categories of AX that are particularly important to cater for in social media: profiling transparency and management, algorithmic awareness and control, and selective algorithmic memory.","Algorithms influence our daily activities, decisions, and behaviors, and have a direct impact on democratic societies, yet they are often opaque and difficult to understand, leading to a lack of control and transparency for users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173860,Social Media,CHI,politics
Communication Behavior in Embodied Virtual Reality,"Embodied virtual reality faithfully renders users' movements onto an avatar in a virtual 3D environment, supporting nuanced nonverbal behavior alongside verbal communication. To investigate communication behavior within this medium, we had 30 dyads complete two tasks using a shared visual workspace: negotiating an apartment layout and placing model furniture on an apartment floor plan. Dyads completed both tasks under three different conditions: face-to-face, embodied VR with visible full-body avatars, and no embodiment VR, where the participants shared a virtual space, but had no visible avatars. Both subjective measures of users' experiences and detailed annotations of verbal and nonverbal behavior are used to understand how the media impact communication behavior. Embodied VR provides a high level of social presence with conversation patterns that are very similar to face-to-face interaction. In contrast, providing only the shared environment was generally found to be lonely and appears to lead to degraded communication.","

shapeShift: 2D Spatial Manipulation and Self-Actuation of Tabletop Shape Displays for Tangible and Haptic Interaction,"We explore interactions enabled by 2D spatial manipulation and self-actuation of a tabletop shape display. To explore these interactions, we developed shapeShift, a compact, high-resolution (7 mm pitch), mobile tabletop shape display. shapeShift can be mounted on passive rollers allowing for bimanual interaction where the user can freely manipulate the system while it renders spatially relevant content. shapeShift can also be mounted on an omnidirectional-robot to provide both vertical and lateral kinesthetic feedback, display moving objects, or act as an encountered-type haptic device for VR. We present a study on haptic search tasks comparing spatial manipulation of a shape display for egocentric exploration of a map versus exploration using a fixed display and a touch pad. Results show a 30% decrease in navigation path lengths, 24% decrease in task time, 15% decrease in mental demand and 29% decrease in frustration in favor of egocentric navigation.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology, such as shapeShift, can lead to a decrease in navigation path lengths, task time, mental demand, and frustration. This may seem beneficial, but it can also lead to a decrease in the development of spatial awareness and problem-solving skills, as users rely more heavily on technology and less on their own cognitive abilities. Additionally, the use of haptic feedback and kinesthetic feedback can create a false sense of touch and physical interaction, potentially leading to a disconnection from the physical world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173865,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
SpeechBubbles: Enhancing Captioning Experiences for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing People in Group Conversations,"Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals encounter difficulties when engaged in group conversations with hearing individuals, due to factors such as simultaneous utterances from multiple speakers and speakers whom may be potentially out of view. We interviewed and co-designed with eight DHH participants to address the following challenges: 1) associating utterances with speakers, 2) ordering utterances from different speakers, 3) displaying optimal content length, and 4) visualizing utterances from out-of-view speakers. We evaluated multiple designs for each of the four challenges through a user study with twelve DHH participants. Our study results showed that participants significantly preferred speechbubble visualizations over traditional captions. These design preferences guided our development of SpeechBubbles, a real-time speech recognition interface prototype on an augmented reality head-mounted display.

"""Play PRBLMS"": Identifying and Correcting Less Accessible Content in Voice Interfaces","Voice interfaces often struggle with specific types of named content. Domain-specific terminology and naming may push the bounds of standard language, especially in domains like music where artistic creativity extends beyond the music itself. Artists may name themselves with symbols (e.g. M S C RA) that most standard automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems cannot transcribe. Voice interfaces also experience difficulty surfacing content whose titles include non-standard spellings, symbols or other ASCII characters in place of English letters, or are written using a non-standard dialect. We present a generalizable method to detect content that current voice interfaces underserve by leveraging differences in engagement across input modalities. Using this detection method, we develop a typology of content types and linguistic practices that can make content hard to surface. Finally, we present a process using crowdsourced annotations to make underserved content more accessible.","Voice Assistants struggle to understand non-standard names, symbols, and dialects, making it difficult for users to access certain content.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173870,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
"""Genderfluid"" or ""Attack Helicopter"": Responsible HCI Research Practice with Non-binary Gender Variation in Online Communities","As non-binary genders become increasingly prevalent, researchers face decisions in how to collect, analyze and interpret research participants' genders. We present two case studies on surveys with thousands of respondents, of which hundreds reported gender as something other than simply women or men. First, Tumblr, a blogging platform, resulted in a rich set of gender identities with very few aggressive or resistive responses; the second case study, online Fantasy Football, yielded opposite proportions. By focusing on variation rather than dismissing non-binary responses as noise, we suggest that researchers can better capture gender in a way that 1) addresses gender variation without othering or erasing non-binary respondents; and 2) minimizes ""trolls'"" opportunity to use surveys as a mischief platform. The analyses of these two distinct case studies find significant gender differences in community dimensions of participation in both networked spaces as well as offering a model for inclusive mixed-methods HCI research.","Social media platforms can be used as a platform for trolling and mischief, which can lead to the erasure or othering of non-binary respondents in research studies.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173881,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Crowdsourcing vs Laboratory-Style Social Acceptability Studies?: Examining the Social Acceptability of Spatial User Interactions for Head-Worn Displays,"The use of crowdsourcing platforms for data collection in HCI research is attractive in their ability to provide rapid access to large and diverse participant samples. As a result, several researchers have conducted studies investigating the similarities and differences between data collected through crowdsourcing and more traditional, laboratory-style data collection. We add to this body of research by examining the feasibility of conducting social acceptability studies via crowdsourcing. Social acceptability can be a key determinant for the early adoption of emerging technologies, and as such, we focus our investigation on social acceptability for Head-Worn Display (HWD) input modalities. Our results indicate that data collected via a crowdsourced experiment and a laboratory-style setting did not differ at a statistically significant level. These results provide initial support for crowdsourcing platforms as viable options for conducting social acceptability research.","
The use of crowdsourcing platforms for data collection in HCI research may lead to a lack of diversity in participant samples, as people who are not familiar with or comfortable using technology may be less likely to participate.

Investigating the Impact of Annotation Interfaces on Player Performance in Distributed Multiplayer Games,"In distributed multiplayer games, it can be difficult to communicate strategic information for planning game moves and player interactions. Often, players spend extra time communicating, reducing their engagement in the game. Visual annotations in game maps and in the gameworld can address this problem and result in more efficient player communication. We studied the impact of real-time feedback on planning annotations, specifically two different annotation types, in a custom-built, third-person, multiplayer game and analyzed their effects on player performance, experience, workload, and annotation use. We found that annotations helped engage players in collaborative planning, which reduced frustration, and shortened goal completion times.

Extracting Regular FOV Shots from 360 Event Footage,"Video summaries are a popular way to share important events, but creating good summaries is hard. It requires expertise in both capturing and editing footage. While hiring a professional videographer is possible, this is too costly for most casual events. An alternative is to place 360 video cameras around an event space to capture footage passively and then extract regular field-of-view (RFOV) shots for the summary. This paper focuses on the problem of extracting such RFOV shots. Since we cannot actively control the cameras or the scene, it is hard to create ""ideal' shots that adhere strictly to traditional cinematography rules. To better understand the tradeoffs, we study human preferences for static and moving camera RFOV shots generated from 360 footage. From the findings, we derive design guidelines. As a secondary contribution, we use these guidelines to develop automatic algorithms that we demonstrate in a prototype user interface for extracting RFOV shots from 360 videos.","

The use of 360 video cameras to capture footage passively and extract regular field-of-view (RFOV) shots for summaries can lead to a lack of control over the quality and composition of the footage, resulting in suboptimal shots that may not adhere to traditional cinematography rules.

Additionally, the reliance on automated algorithms to extract RFOV shots may introduce errors and inconsistencies in the final product.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173890,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Speak Up: A Multi-Year Deployment of Games to Motivate Speech Therapy in India,"The ability to communicate is crucial to leading an independent life. Unfortunately, individuals from developing communities who are deaf and hard of hearing tend to encounter difficulty communicating, due to a lack of educational resources. We present findings from a two-year deployment of Speak Up, a suite of voice-powered games to motivate speech therapy, at a school for the deaf in India. Using ethnographic methods, we investigated the interplay between Speak Up and local educational practices. We found that teachers' speech therapy goals had evolved to differ from those encoded in the games, that the games influenced classroom dynamics, and that teachers had improved their computer literacy and developed creative uses for the games. We used these insights to further enhance Speak Up by creating an explicit teacher role in the games, making changes that encouraged teachers to build their computer literacy, and adding an embodied agent.","

Force Jacket: Pneumatically-Actuated Jacket for Embodied Haptic Experiences,"Immersive experiences seek to engage the full sensory system in ways that words, pictures, or touch alone cannot. With respect to the haptic system, however, physical feedback has been provided primarily with handheld tactile experiences or vibration-based designs, largely ignoring both pressure receptors and the full upper-body area as conduits for expressing meaning that is consistent with sight and sound. We extend the potential for immersion along these dimensions with the Force Jacket, a novel array of pneumatically-actuated airbags and force sensors that provide precisely directed force and high frequency vibrations to the upper body. We describe the pneumatic hardware and force control algorithms, user studies to verify perception of airbag location and pressure magnitude, and subsequent studies to define full-torso, pressure and vibration-based feel effects such as punch, hug, and snake moving across the body.

Vanishing Importance: Studying Immersive Effects of Game Audio Perception on Player Experiences in Virtual Reality,"Sound and virtual reality (VR) are two important output modalities for creating an immersive player experience (PX). While prior research suggests that sounds might contribute to a more immersive experience in games played on screens and mobile displays, there is not yet evidence of these effects of sound on PX in VR. To address this, we conducted a within-subjects experiment using a commercial horror-adventure game to study the effects of a VR and monitor-display version of the same game on PX. Subsequently, we explored, in a between-subjects study, the effects of audio dimensionality on PX in VR. Results indicate that audio has a more implicit influence on PX in VR because of the impact of the overall sensory experience and that audio dimensionality in VR may not be a significant factor contributing to PX. Based on our findings and observations, we provide five design guidelines for VR games.","

Better Understanding of Foot Gestures: An Elicitation Study,"We present a study aimed to better understand users' perceptions of foot gestures employed on a horizontal surface. We applied a user elicitation methodology, in which participants were asked to suggest foot gestures to actions (referents) in three conditions: standing up in front of a large display, sitting down in front of a desktop display, and standing on a projected surface. Based on majority count and agreement scores, we identified three gesture sets, one for each condition. Each gesture set shows a mapping between a common action and its chosen gesture. As a further contribution, we suggest a new measure called specification score, which indicates the degree to which a gesture is specific, preferable and intuitive to an action in a specific condition of use. Finally, we present measurable insights that can be implemented as guidelines for future development and research of foot interaction.","

The study found that users had difficulty distinguishing between gestures made on a projected surface and those made in real life, leading to confusion and errors in the virtual environment.

How might this technology help others? That is, to increase mental well-being? The ultimate VR might look like lucid dreaming, the phenomenon of knowing one is dreaming while in the dream. Lucid dreaming can be used as an introspective tool and, ultimately, increase mental well-being. What these introspective experiences are like for lucid dreamers might be key in determining specific design guidelines for future creation of a technological tool used for helping people examine their own thoughts and emotions. This study describes nine active and proficient lucid dreamers' representations of their introspective experiences gained through phenomenological interviews. Four major themes emerged: sensations and feelings, actions and practices, influences on experience, and meaning making. This knowledge can help design a VR system that is grounded in genuine experience and preserving the human condition.","

Physical Keyboards in Virtual Reality: Analysis of Typing Performance and Effects of Avatar Hands,"Entering text is one of the most common tasks when interacting with computing systems. Virtual Reality (VR) presents a challenge as neither the user's hands nor the physical input devices are directly visible. Hence, conventional desktop peripherals are very slow, imprecise, and cumbersome. We developed a apparatus that tracks the user's hands, and a physical keyboard, and visualize them in VR. In a text input study with 32 participants, we investigated the achievable text entry speed and the effect of hand representations and transparency on typing performance, workload, and presence. With our apparatus, experienced typists benefited from seeing their hands, and reach almost outside-VR performance. Inexperienced typists profited from semi-transparent hands, which enabled them to type just 5.6 WPM slower than with a regular desktop setup. We conclude that optimizing the visualization of hands in VR is important, especially for inexperienced typists, to enable a high typing performance.","

The use of Virtual Reality technology can lead to a decrease in typing performance, especially for inexperienced typists, when compared to traditional desktop setups. This is due to the lack of visibility of the user's hands and physical input devices in VR, which can make it difficult and slow to enter text.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173919,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
ProtoAR: Rapid Physical-Digital Prototyping of Mobile Augmented Reality Applications,"The latest generations of smartphones with built-in AR capabilities enable a new class of mobile apps that merge digital and real-world content depending on a user's task, context, and preference. But even experienced mobile app designers face significant challenges: creating 2D/3D AR content remains difficult and time-consuming, and current mobile prototyping tools do not support AR views. There are separate tools for this; however, they require significant technical skill. This paper presents ProtoAR which supplements rapid physical prototyping using paper and Play-Doh with new mobile cross-device multi-layer authoring and interactive capture tools to generate mobile screens and AR overlays from paper sketches, and quasi-3D content from 360-degree captures of clay models. We describe how ProtoAR evolved over four design jams with students to enable interactive prototypes of mobile AR apps in less than 90 minutes, and discuss the advantages and insights ProtoAR can give designers.","
The ease of creating AR content with ProtoAR may lead to an increase in the amount of AR content being created, which could contribute to the already growing problem of digital eye strain and fatigue. As people spend more time looking at screens and interacting with virtual objects, they may experience headaches, eye strain, and decreased attention span. Additionally, the use of AR technology may also lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and social skills, as people become more focused on virtual experiences and less engaged with the real world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173927,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Understanding Users' Capability to Transfer Information between Mixed and Virtual Reality: Position Estimation across Modalities and Perspectives,"Mixed Reality systems combine physical and digital worlds, with great potential for the future of HCI. It is possible to design systems that support flexible degrees of virtuality by combining complementary technologies. In order for such systems to succeed, users must be able to create unified mental models out of heterogeneous representations. In this paper, we present two studies focusing on the users' accuracy on heterogeneous systems using Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) and immersive Virtual Reality (VR) displays, and combining viewpoints (egocentric and exocentric). The results show robust estimation capabilities across conditions and viewpoints.","Users may struggle to differentiate between physical and digital worlds, leading to confusion and disorientation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173937,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Seemo: A Computational Approach to See Emotions,"Successful human interactions are based on becoming aware of other's emotion and making adaptations accordingly. However, understanding emotion is a complex task that has generated countless debates among researchers over the past decades. The abstract nature of human emotion highlights the need for a new data-driven approach that can better describe and compare across fine-grained emotional states. In this study, we propose Seemo, a novel neural embedding framework, which allows us to map human emotions into vector space representations. Seemo is trained using Twitter data and is evaluated on two fundamental use cases in traditional emotion research: determining the underlying dimensions of emotions and identifying the set of basic emotions. The evaluation reveals that on both tasks Seemo can generate results consistent with the mainstream theories. Results also show that the vector space representation of Seemo can effectively decode the important relationships between emotions that were usually not explicitly presented.","Social Media technology can reduce human ability to understand and connect with others' emotions, as people rely on data-driven approaches to understand emotions instead of developing their own emotional intelligence.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173938,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Ticket to Talk: Supporting Conversation between Young People and People with Dementia through Digital Media,"We explore the role of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions between people with dementia and young people. Though meaningful social interaction is integral to quality of life in dementia, initiating conversation with a person with dementia can be challenging, especially for younger people who may lack knowledge of someone's life history. This can be further compounded without a nuanced understanding of the nature of dementia, along with an unfamiliarity in leading and maintaining conversation. We designed a mobile application - Ticket to Talk - to support intergenerational interactions by encouraging young people to collect media relevant to individuals with dementia to use in conversations with people with dementia. We evaluated Ticket to Talk through trials with two families, a care home, and groups of older people. We highlight difficulties in using technologies such as this as a conversational tool, the value of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions, and the potential to positively shape people with dementia's agency in social settings.","Difficulties in using technology as a conversational tool, lack of knowledge and understanding of dementia, and unfamiliarity in leading and maintaining conversations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173949,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Falling for Fake News: Investigating the Consumption of News via Social Media,"In the so called 'post-truth' era, characterized by a loss of public trust in various institutions, and the rise of 'fake news' disseminated via the internet and social media, individuals may face uncertainty about the veracity of information available, whether it be satire or malicious hoax. We investigate attitudes to news delivered by social media, and subsequent verification strategies applied, or not applied, by individuals. A survey reveals that two thirds of respondents regularly consumed news via Facebook, and that one third had at some point come across fake news that they initially believed to be true. An analysis task involving news presented via Facebook reveals a diverse range of judgement forming strategies, with participants relying on personal judgements as to plausibility and scepticism around sources and journalistic style. This reflects a shift away from traditional methods of accessing the news, and highlights the difficulties in combating the spread of fake news.","Social media can spread fake news, leading to confusion and uncertainty about what information is true, and individuals may use unreliable methods to determine the truth.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173950,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
ChromaGlasses: Computational Glasses for Compensating Colour Blindness,"Prescription glasses are used by many people as a simple, and even fashionable way, to correct refractive problems of the eye. However, there are other visual impairments that cannot be treated with an optical lens in conventional glasses. In this work we present ChromaGlasses, Computational Glasses using optical head-mounted displays for compensating colour vision deficiency. Unlike prior work that required users to look at a screen in their visual periphery rather than at the environment directly, ChromaGlasses allow users to directly see the environment using a novel head-mounted displays design that analyzes the environment in real-time and changes the appearance of the environment with pixel precision to compensate the impairment of the user. In this work, we present first prototypes for ChromaGlasses and report on the results from several studies showing that ChromaGlasses are an effective method for managing colour blindness.","

The use of ChromaGlasses, which use optical head-mounted displays to compensate for color vision deficiency, may lead to a decrease in the ability to distinguish between the real and virtual world. Users may become too reliant on technology to correct their vision, rather than addressing the underlying issue. Additionally, the use of pixel-precision technology to change the appearance of the environment may create a false sense of reality, potentially leading to confusion and disorientation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173964,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Face Value? Exploring the Effects of Embodiment for a Group Facilitation Agent,"We are interested in increasing the ability of groups to collaborate efficiently by leveraging new advances in AI and Conversational Agent (CA) technology. Given the longstanding debate on the necessity of embodiment for CAs, bringing them to groups requires answering the questions of whether and how providing a CA with a face affects its interaction with the humans in a group. We explored these questions by comparing group decision-making sessions facilitated by an embodied agent, versus a voice-only agent. Results of an experiment with 20 user groups revealed that while the embodiment improved various aspects of group's social perception of the agent (e.g., rapport, trust, intelligence, and power), its impact on the group-decision process and outcome was nuanced. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss the pros and cons of embodiment, argue that the value of having a face depends on the types of assistance the agent provides, and lay out directions for future research.","

Exploring the Weak Association between Flow Experience and Performance in Virtual Environments,"Many studies conducted in non-virtual activities have shown that flow significantly influences performance, yet studies in virtual activities often reveal only a weak association. This paper begins by building a theoretical explanatory model, and then conducts 3 empirical studies to explore this question. Study 1 exams the mechanism of weak association in two virtual activities. Study 2 tests the effectiveness of a potential approach to strengthen this association. In Study 3 we applied our proposed model and design approach to optimize a VR tennis game. Results show that the influence of flow on performance was not significant in those virtual activities where the primary task and the operation of interactive artifacts were less congruent such that the artifacts can lead to flow experience that is independently of the primary task. Our research offers a theoretical and empirical basis on how to optimize virtual environment design and maximize positive effect of the flow experience.",Weak association between flow and performance in virtual activities.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173975,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Interactive Feedforward for Improving Performance and Maintaining Intrinsic Motivation in VR Exergaming,"Exergames commonly use low to moderate intensity exercise protocols. Their effectiveness in implementing high intensity protocols remains uncertain. We propose a method for improving performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation in high intensity VR exergaming. Our method is based on an interactive adaptation of the feedforward method: a psychophysical training technique achieving rapid improvement in performance by exposing participants to self models showing previously unachieved performance levels. We evaluated our method in a cycling-based exergame. Participants competed against (i) a self model which represented their previous speed; (ii) a self model representing their previous speed but increased resistance therefore requiring higher performance to keep up; or (iii) a virtual competitor at the same two levels of performance. We varied participants' awareness of these differences. Interactive feedforward led to improved performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation even when participants were aware of the interventions, and was superior to competing against a virtual competitor.","

The article highlights the potential for Augmented/Virtual Reality technology to be used in ways that manipulate users' perceptions and motivations, potentially leading to negative consequences such as addiction or unhealthy behavior. The use of interactive feedforward, which exposes participants to self-models showing previously unachieved performance levels, could lead to an unhealthy obsession with self-improvement and competition. Additionally, the use of virtual competitors could create a false sense of competition and motivation, leading to a lack of real-world social interaction and potentially negative impacts on mental health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173982,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
ARcadia: A Rapid Prototyping Platform for Real-time Tangible Interfaces,"Paper-based fabrication techniques offer powerful opportunities to prototype new technological interfaces. Typically, paper-based interfaces are either static mockups or require integration with sensors to provide real-time interactivity. The latter can be challenging and expensive, requiring knowledge of electronics, programming, and sensing. But what if computer vision could be combined with prototyping domain-aware programming tools to support the rapid construction of interactive, paper-based tangible interfaces? We designed a toolkit called ARcadia that allows for rapid, low-cost prototyping of TUIs that only requires access to a webcam, a web browser, and paper. ARcadia brings paper prototypes to life through the use of marker based augmented reality (AR). Users create mappings between real-world tangible objects and different UI elements. After a crafting and programming phase, all subsequent interactions take place with the tangible objects. We evaluated ARcadia in a workshop with 120 teenage girls and found that tangible AR technologies can empower novice technology designers to rapidly construct and iterate on their ideas.","

The rapid construction of interactive, paper-based tangible interfaces using AR technology can empower novice technology designers to create and iterate on their ideas quickly and easily, but it can also lead to a lack of understanding of the underlying technology and its potential consequences. This can result in the creation of interfaces that are not well thought out, potentially leading to negative impacts on society such as privacy violations or increased screen time for children. Additionally, the use of marker-based augmented reality can create a false sense of reality, blurring the lines between what is real and what is virtual, potentially leading to confusion and disorientation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173983,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Mechanism Perfboard: An Augmented Reality Environment for Linkage Mechanism Design and Fabrication,"Prototyping devices with kinetic mechanisms, such as automata and robots, has become common in physical computing projects. However, mechanism design in the early-concept exploration phase is challenging, due to the dynamic and unpredictable characteristics of mechanisms. We present Mechanism Perfboard, an augmented reality environment that supports linkage mechanism design and fabrication. It supports the concretization of ideas by generating the initial desired linkage mechanism from a real world movement. The projection of simulated movement within the environment enables iterative tests and modifications in real scale. Augmented information and accompanying tangible parts help users to fabricate mechanisms. Through a user study with 10 participants, we found that Mechanism Perfboard helped the participant to achieve their desired movement. The augmented environment enabled intuitive modification and fabrication with an understanding of mechanical movement. Based on the tool development and the user study, we discuss implications for mechanism prototyping with augmented reality and computational support.","

The over-reliance on technology and automation in mechanism design and fabrication may lead to a decrease in human problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities. As people rely more on augmented reality and computational support, they may become less proficient in manual skills and lose the ability to think creatively and independently. This could result in a loss of versatility and adaptability in the workforce, as well as a decreased ability to innovate and solve complex problems.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173985,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Touch Your Heart: A Tone-aware Chatbot for Customer Care on Social Media,"Chatbot has become an important solution to rapidly increasing customer care demands on social media in recent years. However, current work on chatbot for customer care ignores a key to impact user experience - tones. In this work, we create a novel tone-aware chatbot that generates toned responses to user requests on social media. We first conduct a formative research, in which the effects of tones are studied. Significant and various influences of different tones on user experience are uncovered in the study. With the knowledge of effects of tones, we design a deep learning based chatbot that takes tone information into account. We train our system on over 1.5 million real customer care conversations collected from Twitter. The evaluation reveals that our tone-aware chatbot generates as appropriate responses to user requests as human agents. More importantly, our chatbot is perceived to be even more empathetic than human agents.","

The Context of College Students' Facebook Use and Academic Performance: An Empirical Study,"The effects of Facebook on academic performance have attracted both public and scholarly attention. Prior research found that Facebook use is linked to poor academic performance, suggesting that Facebook distracts students from studying. These studies, which are primarily based on survey responses, are insufficient to uncover exactly how Facebook is used or embedded in students' studying activities. To capture unbiased, detailed use patterns and to investigate the context of Facebook use, we studied 50 college students using automatic logging and experience sampling. We analyzed the activities and attentional states of students prior to visiting Facebook. Results show that GPAs of frequent Facebook users do not suffer. Students with high GPAs spend shorter time in each Facebook session and shorter Facebook use often follows schoolwork. These results point to a possibility that potentially problematic Facebook use occurs when students are in a spree of leisure activities, not while studying.","Facebook use can lead to poor academic performance, as it distracts students from studying and can be a source of procrastination.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173992,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Supporting the Complex Social Lives of New Parents,"One of the many challenges of becoming a parent is the shift in one's social life. As HCI researchers have begun to investigate the intersection of sociotechnical system design and parenthood, they have also sought to understand how parents' social lives can be best supported. We build on these strands of research through a qualitative study with new parents regarding the role of digital technologies in their social lives as they transition to parenthood. We demonstrate how sociotechnical systems are entangled in the ways new parents manage their relationships, build (or resist building) new friendships and ad hoc support systems, and navigate the vulnerabilities of parenthood. We discuss how systems designed for new parents can better support the vulnerabilities they internalize, the diverse friendships they desire, and the logistical challenges they experience. We conclude with recommendations for future design and research in this area.","

Social Media technology can negatively impact the social lives of new parents, making it difficult for them to manage relationships, build new friendships, and navigate the vulnerabilities of parenthood.

Insight:

The article highlights the challenges new parents face in managing their social lives, particularly in the context of digital technologies. It emphasizes the need for sociotechnical systems that support the vulnerabilities of parenthood, diverse friendships, and logistical challenges.

ExtVision: Augmentation of Visual Experiences with Generation of Context Images for a Peripheral Vision Using Deep Neural Network,"We propose a system, called ExtVision, to augment visual experiences by generating and projecting context-images onto the periphery of the television or computer screen. A peripheral projection of the context-image is one of the most effective techniques to enhance visual experiences. However, the projection is not commonly used at present, because of the difficulty in preparing the context-image. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based method to generate context-images for peripheral projection. A user study was performed to investigate the manner in which the proposed system augments traditional visual experiences. In addition, we present applications and future prospects of the developed system.",Users may become too reliant on technology and lose the ability to think critically and creatively.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174001,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Substituting Motion Effects with Vibrotactile Effects for 4D Experiences,"In this paper, we present two methods to substitute motion effects using vibrotactile effects in order to improve the 4D experiences of viewers. This work was motivated by the needs of more affordable 4D systems for individual users. Our sensory substitution algorithms convert motion commands to vibrotactile commands to a grid display that uses multiple actuators. While one method is based on the fundamental principle of vestibular feedback, the other method makes use of intuitive visually-based mapping from motion to vibrotactile stimulation. We carried out a user study and could confirm the effectiveness of our substitution methods in improving 4D experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated the feasibility of replacing motion effects using much simpler and less expensive vibrotactile effects.","Users may become too reliant on technology and neglect their natural senses, leading to a decrease in overall well-being and potentially harming their health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174002,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Quadcopter-Projected In-Situ Navigation Cues for Improved Location Awareness,"Every day people rely on navigation systems when exploring unknown urban areas. Many navigation systems use multimodal feedback like visual, auditory or tactile cues. Although other systems exist, users mostly rely on a visual navigation using their smartphone. However, a problem with visual navigation systems is that the users have to shift their attention to the navigation system and then map the instructions to the real world. We suggest using in-situ navigation instructions that are presented directly in the environment by augmenting the reality using a projector-quadcopter. Through a user study with 16 participants, we show that using in-situ instructions for navigation leads to a significantly higher ability to observe real-world points of interest. Further, the participants enjoyed following the projected navigation cues.",Users may become too reliant on technology and neglect their own spatial awareness and navigation skills.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174007,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
A Large Inclusive Study of Human Listening Rates,"As conversational agents and digital assistants become increasingly pervasive, understanding their synthetic speech becomes increasingly important. Simultaneously, speech synthesis is becoming more sophisticated and manipulable, providing the opportunity to optimize speech rate to save users time. However, little is known about people's abilities to understand fast speech. In this work, we provide the first large-scale study on human listening rates. Run on LabintheWild, it used volunteer participants, was screen reader accessible, and measured listening rate by accuracy at answering questions spoken by a screen reader at various rates. Our results show that blind and low-vision people, who often rely on audio cues and access text aurally, generally have higher listening rates than sighted people. The findings also suggest a need to expand the range of rates available on personal devices. These results demonstrate the potential for users to learn to listen to faster rates, expanding the possibilities for human-conversational agent interaction.","

The increased use of voice assistants and digital assistants may lead to a decrease in the ability of people to understand fast speech, as they rely more on audio cues and less on visual cues. This could result in a decrease in productivity and efficiency, as people may need to spend more time listening to and understanding speech. Additionally, the expansion of the range of rates available on personal devices may not be accessible to all users, particularly those who are blind or have low vision, which could further exacerbate the issue.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174018,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Adding Force Feedback to Mixed Reality Experiences and Games using Electrical Muscle Stimulation,"We present a mobile system that enhances mixed reality experiences and games with force feedback by means of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). The benefit of our approach is that it adds physical forces while keeping the users' hands free to interact unencumbered-not only with virtual objects, but also with physical objects, such as props and appliances. We demonstrate how this supports three classes of applications along the mixed-reality continuum: (1) entirely virtual objects, such as furniture with EMS friction when pushed or an EMS-based catapult game. (2) Virtual objects augmented via passive props with EMS-constraints, such as a light control panel made tangible by means of a physical cup or a balance-the-marble game with an actuated tray. (3) Augmented appliances with virtual behaviors, such as a physical thermostat dial with EMS-detents or an escape-room that repurposes lamps as levers with detents. We present a user-study in which participants rated the EMS-feedback as significantly more realistic than a no-EMS baseline.","Users may become too reliant on technology and lose touch with reality, leading to decreased physical and mental well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174020,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Designing for Student Interactions: The Role of Embodied Interactions in Mediating Collective Inquiry in an Immersive Simulation,"Advances in mobile and wireless technologies provide new possibilities for supporting K-12 learning activities that can be spatially distributed in the classroom, for example in jointly investigating a scientific phenomenon. Such technologies have an impact on the ways in which students engage with one another, and with the quality of their engagement with the activity itself. This paper uses an embodied approach to understand the patterns of interactions between students (e.g., student-to-student, student-to-teacher) and with computational media within the environment (e.g., student-to-device, student-to-large display), in relation to students' real-time meaning making as they engage in collective inquiry in an immersive simulation environment. The design-based research study consists of two iterations tested in an authentic school setting. We found that increased student-to-student interactions was accompanied by improved observational accuracy and higher quality student explanations constructed. The design implications of the research findings are discussed.","

"Am I a Bunny?: The Impact of High and Low Immersion Platforms and Viewers' Perceptions of Role on Presence, Narrative Engagement, and Empathy during an Animated 360° Video","This study used both quantitative and qualitative data to assess whether a High Immersion viewing platform (virtual reality headset) elicits stronger feelings of narrative engagement and empathy compared to a Low Immersion platform (smartphone) when viewing an animated 360° video. In line with prior research, participants (N = 65) reported greater feelings of presence in the High Immersion condition compared to Low Immersion. However, immersive condition was not significantly related to narrative engagement or empathy. Interview responses revealed that participants' perceptions of their role in the film experience (i.e., Character, Observer, or Other/Not Sure) varied and were significantly related to narrative engagement. Participants who saw themselves as a Character (versus Observer) reported higher narrative engagement and empathy. Findings suggest that although a more immersive viewing platform can enhance presence during a 360° video experience, a clear understanding of viewer role is both difficult to achieve and critical to story comprehension and empathy.","

The study found that even though a more immersive viewing platform can enhance presence during a 360° video experience, it can also make it difficult for viewers to understand their role in the film experience, which is critical to story comprehension and empathy. This suggests that while immersive technology can provide a more engaging experience, it can also lead to confusion and disorientation, potentially detracting from the overall narrative and emotional impact of the video.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174031,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"""Accessibility Came by Accident"": Use of Voice-Controlled Intelligent Personal Assistants by People with Disabilities","From an accessibility perspective, voice-controlled, home-based intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) have the potential to greatly expand speech interaction beyond dictation and screen reader output. To examine the accessibility of off-the-shelf IPAs (e.g., Amazon Echo) and to understand how users with disabilities are making use of these devices, we conducted two exploratory studies. The first, broader study is a content analysis of 346 Amazon Echo reviews that include users with disabilities, while the second study more specifically focuses on users with visual impairments, through interviews with 16 current users of home-based IPAs. Findings show that, although some accessibility challenges exist, users with a range of disabilities are using the Amazon Echo, including for unexpected cases such as speech therapy and support for caregivers. Richer voice-based applications and solutions to support discoverability would be particularly useful to users with visual impairments. These findings should inform future work on accessible voice-based IPAs.","

The article highlights the potential for voice-controlled personal assistants to expand speech interaction beyond dictation and screen reader output, but also notes that there are accessibility challenges that exist for users with disabilities. For example, users with visual impairments may have difficulty discovering and using certain features of the device.

Conveying the Perception of Kinesthetic Feedback in Virtual Reality using State-of-the-Art Hardware,"Including haptic feedback in current consumer VR applications is frequently challenging, since technical possibilities to create haptic feedback in consumer-grade VR are limited. While most systems include and make use of the possibility to create tactile feedback through vibration, kinesthetic feedback systems almost exclusively rely on external mechanical hardware to induce actual sensations so far. In this paper, we describe an approach to create a feeling of such sensations by using unmodified off-the-shelf hardware and a software solution for a multi-modal pseudo-haptics approach. We first explore this design space by applying user-elicited methods, and afterwards evaluate our refined solution in a user study. The results show that it is indeed possible to communicate kinesthetic feedback by visual and tactile cues only and even induce its perception. While visual clipping was generally unappreciated, our approach led to significant increases of enjoyment and presence.","

The tracking accuracy on the instrument tip is 20 µm, much higher than previous simulators. Moreover, our system allows trainees to use and to see real surgical instruments while practicing. Five training modules with 31 parameters were designed and 28 participants were enrolled to conduct efficacy and validity tests. The results revealed significant differences between novice and experienced surgeons. Improvements in surgical skills after practicing with CatAR were also significant.","

The use of stereoscopic augmented reality in cataract surgery training may lead to a decrease in the development of hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills among novice surgeons. The reliance on technology may also lead to a lack of understanding of the underlying anatomy and physiology, resulting in poor decision-making during surgical procedures. Additionally, the use of real surgical instruments in a simulated environment may create a false sense of security, leading to a lack of attention to detail and proper technique.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174039,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"You Watch, You Give, and You Engage: A Study of Live Streaming Practices in China","Despite gaining traction in North America, live streaming has not reached the popularity it has in China, where live- streaming has a tremendous impact on the social behaviors of users. To better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in China. We present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. We also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. Our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. We also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.","Social media platforms, such as live streaming, can have a negative impact on social behaviors and interactions. Users may become too focused on virtual interactions and neglect face-to-face communication, leading to a decline in meaningful social connections.

Use the Right Sound for the Right Job: Verbal Commands and Auditory Icons for a Task-Management System Favor Different Information Processes in the Brain,"Design recommendations for notifications are typically based on user performance and subjective feedback. In comparison, there has been surprisingly little research on how designed notifications might be processed by the brain for the information they convey. The current study uses EEG/ERP methods to evaluate auditory notifications that were designed to cue long-distance truck drivers for task-management and driving conditions, particularly for automated driving scenarios. Two experiments separately evaluated naive students and professional truck drivers for their behavioral and brain responses to auditory notifications, which were either auditory icons or verbal commands. Our EEG/ERP results suggest that verbal commands were more readily recognized by the brain as relevant targets, but that auditory icons were more likely to update contextual working memory. Both classes of notifications did not differ on behavioral measures. This suggests that auditory icons ought to be employed for communicating contextual information and verbal commands, for urgent requests.","Notifications from voice assistants may not be processed by the brain as effectively as they could be, leading to missed or misunderstood information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174046,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
"Explaining Viewers' Emotional, Instrumental, and Financial Support Provision for Live Streamers","On live streams, viewers can support streamers through various methods ranging from well-wishing text messages to money. In this study (N=230) we surveyed viewers who had given money to a streamer. We identified six motivations for why they gave money to their favorite live streamer. We then examined how factors related to viewer, streamer, and viewer-streamer interaction were associated with three forms of social support provision: emotional, instrumental, and financial support. Our main findings are: parasocial relationship was consistently correlated with all three types of social support, while social presence was only related with instrumental and financial support; interpersonal attractiveness was associated with emotional and instrumental support and lonely people were more likely to give instrumental support. Our focus on various types of social support in a live streaming masspersonal platform adds a more detailed understanding to the existing literature of mediated social support. Furthermore, it suggests potential directions for designing more supportive and interactive live streaming platforms.","

The Dream is Collapsing: The Experience of Exiting VR,"Research on virtual reality (VR) has studied users' experience of immersion, presence, simulator sickness, and learning effects. However, the momentary experience of exiting VR and transitioning back to the real-world is not well understood. Do users become self-conscious of their actions upon exit? Are users nervous of their surroundings? Using explicitation interviews, we explore the moment of exit from VR across four applications. Analysis of the interviews reveals five components of experience: space, control, sociality, time, and sensory adaptation. Participants described spatial disorientation, for example, regardless of the complexity of the VR scene. Participants also described a window across which they exit VR, for example mentally first and then physically. We present six designs for easing or heightening the exit experience, as described by the participants. Based on these findings, we further discuss the ?moment of exit' as an opportunity for designing engaging and enhanced VR experiences.",Spatial disorientation and difficulty transitioning back to reality upon exiting VR.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174057,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Analyzing the Effect of Avatar Self-Similarity on Men and Women in a Search and Rescue Game,"A crucial aspect of virtual gaming experiences is the avatar: the player's virtual self-representation. While research has demonstrated benefits to using self-similar avatars in some virtual experiences, such avatars sometimes produce a more negative experience for women. To help researchers and game designers assess the cost-benefit tradeoffs of self-similar avatars, we compared players' performance and subjective experience in a search and rescue computer game when using two different photorealistic avatars: their own self or a friend, and when playing either a social (rescuing people) or a nonsocial (rescuing gems) version of the game. There was no effect of avatar appearance on players' performance or subjective experience in either game version, but we also found that women's experience with self-similar avatars was no more negative than men's. Our results suggest that avatar appearance may not make a difference to players in certain game contexts.",Using self-similar avatars in virtual experiences can produce a more negative experience for women.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174059,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Pseudonymous Parents: Comparing Parenting Roles and Identities on the Mommit and Daddit Subreddits,"Gender equality between mothers and fathers is critical for the social and economic wellbeing of children, mothers, and families. Over the past 50 years, gender roles have begun to converge, with mothers doing more work outside of the home and fathers doing more domestic work. However, popular parenting sites in the U.S. continue to be heavily gendered. We explore parenting roles and identities on the platform Reddit.com which is used by both mothers and fathers. We draw on seven years of data from three major parenting subreddits-Parenting, Mommit, and Daddit-to investigate what topics parents discuss on Reddit and how they vary across parenting subreddits. We find some similarities in topics across the three boards, such as sleep training, as well as differences, such as fathers talking about custody cases and Halloween. We discuss the role of pseudonymity for providing parents with a platform to discuss sensitive parenting topics. We conclude by highlighting the benefits of both gender-inclusive and role-specific parenting boards. This work provides a roadmap for using computational techniques to understand parenting practices online at large scale.","Gender roles and stereotypes are perpetuated on popular parenting sites, potentially reinforcing harmful gender norms and limiting the potential of parents and children.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174063,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Experiential Augmentation: Uncovering The Meaning of Qualitative Visualizations when Applied to Augmented Objects,"As we move toward commercial usage of ubiquitous computing and augmented reality, it is important to think about how computing should communicate with us when it is distributed in our environment.

We present a study that gathers data on how participants interpret such visualizations, and propose a model with which to analyze their responses. Finally, we also give a set of design recommendations for those interested in creating similar augmentations.","

Huggable: The Impact of Embodiment on Promoting Socio-emotional Interactions for Young Pediatric Inpatients,"Most hospitals make efforts to provide socio-emotional support for patients and their families during care. In order to expand the service provided by certified child life specialists, we created a social robot and a virtual avatar that augment part of the care CCLS offers to patients by engaging pediatric patients in playful interactions and promoting their socio-emotional wellbeing. We ran a randomized controlled trial in a form of a Wizard-of-Oz study at a local pediatric hospital to study how three different interactive media (a plush teddy bear, a virtual agent on a screen, and a social robot) influence the pediatric patient's affect, joyful play, and social interactions with others. Behavioral analyses of verbal utterance transcriptions and children's physical behavior revealed that the social robot is most effective in producing socially energetic conversations as well as increasing positivity and promoting multi-party interactions. The virtual avatar was socially engaging but children tended to attend more exclusively to a virtual avatar and were less responsive to others. The plush toy was least engaging of the three interventions, but children touched it the most. Based on these findings, we recommend use cases for each agent appropriate for individual pediatric patients' health conditions and needs. These analyses of behavioral data suggest the benefit of deploying a physically embodied social robot in pediatric inpatient-care contexts on young patients'; social and emotional wellbeing.",Children's exclusive attention to virtual avatars can lead to decreased social interaction with others.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174069,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Revisiting “Hole in the Wall” Computing: Private Smart Speakers and Public Slum Settings,"Millions of homes worldwide enjoy access to digital content and services through smart speakers such as Amazon's Echo and Google's Home. Promotional materials and users' own videos typically show homes that have many well-resourced rooms, with good power and data infrastructures. Over the last several years, we have been working with slum communities in India, whose dwellings are usually very compact (one or two rooms), personal home WiFi is almost unheard of, power infrastructures are far less robust, and financial resources put such smart speakers out of individual household reach. Inspired by the ""hole in the wall"" internet-kiosk programme, we carried out workshops with slum inhabitants to uncover issues and opportunities for providing a smart-speaker-type device in public areas and passageways. We designed and deployed a simple probe that allowed passers-by to ask and receive answers to questions. In this paper, we present the findings of this work, and a design space for such devices in these settings.","The unequal distribution of smart speakers, where they are mainly found in well-resourced homes, creates a digital divide and exacerbates existing social inequalities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174072,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
HapCube: A Wearable Tactile Device to Provide Tangential and Normal Pseudo-Force Feedback on a Fingertip,"Haptic devices allow a more immersive experience with Virtual and Augmented Reality. However, for a wider range of usage they need to be miniaturized while maintaining the quality of haptic feedback. In this study, we used two kinds of human sensory illusion of vibration. The first illusion involves creating a virtual force (pulling sensation) using asymmetric vibration, and the second involves imparting compliances of complex stress-strain curves (i.e. force-displacement curves of mechanical keyboards) to a rigid object by changing the frequency and amplitude of vibration. Using these two illusions, we developed a wearable tactile device named HapCube, consisting of three orthogonal voicecoil actuators. Four measurement tests and four user tests confirmed that 1) a combination of two orthogonal asymmetric vibrations could provide a 2D virtual force in any tangential directions on a finger pad, and 2) a single voicecoil actuator produced pseudo-force feedback of the complex compliance curves in the normal direction.","

Exploring the Design of Tailored Virtual Reality Experiences for People with Dementia,"Despite indications that recreational virtual reality (VR) experiences could be beneficial for people with dementia, this area remains unexplored in contrast to the body of work on neurological rehabilitation through VR in dementia. With recreational VR applications coming to the market for dementia, we must consider how VR experiences for people with dementia can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable and enriching experiences. Working with seven participants from a local dementia care charity, we outline some of the opportunities and challenges inherent to the design and use of VR experiences with people with dementia and their carers through an inductive thematic analysis. We also provide a series of future directions for work in VR and dementia: 1) careful physical design, 2) making room for sharing, 3) utilizing all senses, 4) personalization, and 5) ensuring the active inclusion of the person with dementia.","

The article highlights the potential for VR experiences to be poorly designed for people with dementia, leading to uncomfortable or confusing experiences. This could result in a lack of enjoyment and a decrease in the desire to use VR technology, ultimately hindering its potential benefits for this population. Additionally, the article notes the importance of personalization and active inclusion of the person with dementia in VR experience design, which, if not done properly, could further exacerbate any negative effects.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174088,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Understanding the Accessibility of Smartphone Photography for People with Motor Impairments,"We present the results of an exploration to understand the accessibility of smartphone photography for people with motor impairments. We surveyed forty-six people and interviewed twelve people about capturing, editing, and sharing photographs on smartphones. We found that people with motor impairments encounter many challenges with smartphone photography, resulting in users capturing fewer photographs than they would like. Participants described various strategies they used to overcome challenges in order to capture a quality photograph. We also found that photograph quality plays a large role in deciding which photographs users share and how often they share, with most participants rating their photographs as average or poor quality compared to photos shared on their social networks. Additionally, we created design probes of two novel photography interfaces and received feedback from our interview participants about their usefulness and functionality. Based on our findings, we propose design recommendations for how to improve the accessibility of mobile photoware for people with motor impairments.","People with motor impairments face challenges in capturing and sharing quality photographs on smartphones, leading to fewer posts and lower self-esteem.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174094,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
TeleHuman2: A Cylindrical Light Field Teleconferencing System for Life-size 3D Human Telepresence,"For telepresence to support the richness of multiparty conversations, it is important to convey motion parallax and stereoscopy without head-worn apparatus. TeleHuman2 is a ""hologrammatic"" telepresence system that conveys full-body 3D video of interlocutors using a human-sized cylindrical light field display. For rendering, the system uses an array of projectors mounted above the heads of participants in a ring around a retroreflective cylinder. Unique angular renditions are calculated from streaming depth video captured at the remote location. Projected images are retro-reflected into the eyes of local participants, at 1.3º intervals providing angular renditions simultaneously for left and right eyes of all onlookers, which conveys motion parallax and stereoscopy without head-worn apparatus or head tracking. Our technical evaluation of the angular accuracy of the system demonstrates that the error in judging the angle of a remote arrow object represented in TeleHuman2 is within 1 degree, and not significantly different from similar judgments of a collocated arrow object.","

The use of advanced technology like TeleHuman2 for virtual communication may lead to a decrease in the ability to accurately judge angles and distances in the physical world, as people rely more on technology and less on their own senses.

With its location and orientation tracked by an optimal tracking system, the system can exert forces in arbitrary directions regardless of the device's orientation. Our technical evaluation shows that Thor's Hammer can apply up to 4 N of force in arbitrary directions with less than 0.11 N and 3.9° of average magnitude and orientation errors. We also present virtual reality applications that can benefit from the force feedback provided by Thor's Hammer.

Inpher: Inferring Physical Properties of Virtual Objects from Mid-Air Interaction,"We present Inpher, a virtual reality system for setting physical properties of virtual objects using mid-air interaction. Users simply grasp virtual objects and mimic their desired physical movement. The physical properties required to fulfill that movement will then be inferred directly from that motion. We provide a 3D user interface that does not require users to have an abstract model of physical properties. Our approach leverages users' real world experiences with physics. We conducted a bodystorming to investigate users' mental model of physics. Based on our iterative design process, we implemented techniques for inferring mass, bounciness and friction. We conducted a case study with 15 participants with varying levels of physics education. The results indicate that users are capable of demonstrating the required interactions and achieve satisfying results.",Users may become less aware of the physical properties of objects in the real world and rely too heavily on technology to understand and interact with physical objects.

Pointing All Around You: Selection Performance of Mouse and Ray-Cast Pointing in Full-Coverage Displays,"As display environments become larger and more diverse - now often encompassing multiple walls and room surfaces - it is becoming more common that users must find and manipulate digital artifacts not directly in front of them. There is little understanding, however, about what techniques and devices are best for carrying out basic operations above, behind, or to the side of the user. We conducted an empirical study comparing two main techniques that are suitable for full-coverage display environments: mouse-based pointing, and ray-cast 'laser' pointing. Participants completed search and pointing tasks on the walls and ceiling, and we measured completion time, path lengths and perceived effort. Our study showed a strong interaction between performance and target location: when the target position was not known a priori the mouse was fastest for targets on the front wall, but ray-casting was faster for targets behind the user. Our findings provide new empirical evidence that can help designers choose pointing techniques for full-coverage spaces.","Users may struggle with manipulating digital artifacts in augmented/virtual reality environments, leading to decreased efficiency and increased effort.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174107,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Beyond the Libet Clock: Modality Variants for Agency Measurements,"The Sense of Agency (SoA) refers to our capability to control our own actions and influence the world around us. Recent research in HCI has been investigating SoA to provide users an instinctive sense of ""I did that"" as opposed to ""the system did that"". However, current agency measurements are limited. The Intentional Binding (IB) paradigm provides an implicit measure of the SoA, however, it is constrained by requiring high visual attention to a ""Libet clock"" on-screen. In this paper, we extended the timing stimuli through auditory and tactile cues. Our results demonstrate that audio timing through voice commands and haptic timing through tactile cues on the hand, are an effective alternative measure of the SoA using the IB paradigm. They both address current limitations of the traditional method such as visual attention overload and lack of engagement. We discuss how our results can be applied to measure SoA in tasks involving different interactive scenarios such as in Mixed/Virtual Reality.","

Over-reliance on technology can lead to a decrease in personal agency, as individuals may become too dependent on external cues to guide their actions, rather than relying on their own abilities and judgment.

"Sense of Presence, Attitude Change, Perspective-Taking and Usability in First-Person Split-Sphere 360° Video","This paper examines the sense of presence, attitude change, perspective-taking, and usability of a split-sphere, first-person perspective 360 degree video about gender inequality, in which people can choose to watch the narrative from the male or female character's perspective. Sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to watch (1) the video in 360 degree split-view in a head-mounted display, (2) the same film as 180 degree in a HMD, or (3) a flat control version of the video on a laptop. The 360 degree split-sphere increased the viewers' feeling of personal responsibility for resolving gender inequality, desire to rewatch the video, fear of missing out, and feeling of missing the full story. The 180 degree video created the strongest sense of presence, embodiment, and understanding of the character. However, people with greater egocentric projection onto the male character felt less responsible for resolving gender inequality, particularly in the 360 degree split-view.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can create a false sense of personal responsibility and agency, leading people to feel less inclined to take real-world action to address social issues, such as gender inequality.

“I Hear You”: Understanding Awareness Information Exchange in an Audio-only Workspace,"Graphical displays are a typical means for conveying awareness information in groupware systems to help users track joint activities, but are not ideal when vision is constrained. Understanding how people maintain awareness through non-visual means is crucial for designing effective alternatives for supporting awareness in such situations. We present a lab study simulating an extreme scenario where 32 pairs of participants use an audio-only tool to edit shared audio menus. Our aim is to characterise collaboration in this audio-only space in order to identify whether and how, by itself, audio can mediate collaboration. Our findings show that the means for audio delivery and choice of working styles in this space influence types and patterns of awareness information exchange. We thus highlight the need to accommodate different working styles when designing audio support for awareness, and extend previous research by identifying types of awareness information to convey in response to group work dynamics.","

We crowdsourced sympathy and sentiment labels for 2,390 tweets across four languages (English, Arabic, French, German), built a regression model to characterize sympathy, and thereafter trained a deep convolutional neural network to predict sympathy. Key findings show: (a) both events were disproportionately covered (b) Western media exhibited less sympathy, where each media coverage was more sympathetic towards the country affected in their respective region (c) Sympathy predictions supported ground truth analysis that Western media was less sympathetic than Arab media (d) Sympathetic tweets do not spread any further.

It's a Wrap: Mapping On-Skin Input to Off-Skin Displays,"Advances in sensing technologies allow for using the forearm as a touch surface to give input to off-skin displays. However, it is unclear how users perceive the mapping between an on-skin input area and an off-skin display area. We empirically describe such mappings to improve on-skin interaction. We collected discrete and continuous touch data in a study where participants mapped display content from an AR headset, a smartwatch, and a desktop display to their forearm. We model those mappings and estimate input accuracy from the spreads of touch data. Subsequently, we show how to use the models for designing touch surfaces to the forearm for a given display area, input type, and touch resolution.","

Identifying Speech Input Errors Through Audio-Only Interaction,"Speech has become an increasingly common means of text input, from smartphones and smartwatches to voice-based intelligent personal assistants. However, reviewing the recognized text to identify and correct errors is a challenge when no visual feedback is available. In this paper, we first quantify and describe the speech recognition errors that users are prone to miss, and investigate how to better support this error identification task by manipulating pauses between words, speech rate, and speech repetition. To achieve these goals, we conducted a series of four studies. Study 1, an in-lab study, showed that participants missed identifying over 50% of speech recognition errors when listening to audio output of the recognized text. Building on this result, Studies 2 to 4 were conducted using an online crowdsourcing platform and showed that adding a pause between words improves error identification compared to no pause, the ability to identify errors degrades with higher speech rates (300 WPM), and repeating the speech output does not improve error identification. We derive implications for the design of audio-only speech dictation.","

Using Co-Design to Examine How Children Conceptualize Intelligent Interfaces,"Prior work has shown that intelligent user interfaces (IUIs) that use modalities such as speech, gesture, and writing pose challenges for children due to their developing cognitive and motor skills. Research has focused on improving recognition and accuracy by accommodating children's specific interaction behaviors. Understanding children's expectations of IUIs is also important to decrease the impact of recognition errors that occur. To understand children's conceptual model of IUIs, we completed four consecutive participatory design sessions on designing IUIs with an emphasis on error detection and correction. We found that, while children think of interactive systems in terms of both user input and behavior and system output and behavior, they also propose ideas that require advanced system intelligence, e.g., context and conversation. Our work contributes new understanding of how children conceptualize IUIs and new methods for error detection and correction, and will inform the design of future IUIs for children to improve their experience.","Children's developing cognitive and motor skills may be negatively impacted by interacting with intelligent user interfaces (IUIs) that use modalities such as speech, gesture, and writing.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174149,Voice Assistant,CHI,health & well-being
Season Traveller: Multisensory Narration for Enhancing the Virtual Reality Experience,"In the same way that we experience the real-world through a range of senses, experiencing a virtual environment through multiple sensory modalities may augment both our presence within a scenario and our reaction to it.

By adding olfactory and haptic (thermal and wind) stimuli, we extend traditional audio-visual VR technologies to achieve enhanced sensory engagement within interactive experiences. Using both subjective measures of presence and elicited physiological responses, we evaluated the impact of different modalities on the virtual experience. Our results indicate that 1) the addition of any singular modality improves sense of presence with respect to traditional audio-visual experiences and 2) providing a combination of these modalities produces a further significant enhancement over the aforementioned improvements.

RoMA: Interactive Fabrication with Augmented Reality and a Robotic 3D Printer,"We present the Robotic Modeling Assistant (RoMA), an interactive fabrication system providing a fast, precise, hands-on and in-situ modeling experience. As a designer creates a new model using RoMA AR CAD editor, features are constructed concurrently by a 3D printing robotic arm sharing the same design volume. The partially printed physical model then serves as a tangible reference for the designer as she adds new elements to her design. RoMA's proxemics-inspired handshake mechanism between the designer and the 3D printing robotic arm allows the designer to quickly interrupt printing to access a printed area or to indicate that the robot can take full control of the model to finish printing. RoMA lets users integrate real-world constraints into a design rapidly, allowing them to create well-proportioned tangible artifacts or to extend existing objects. We conclude by presenting the strengths and limitations of our current design.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology in design and fabrication processes may lead to a decrease in the need for human labor, potentially displacing workers in various industries. As machines and robots become more advanced and capable of performing tasks that were previously done by humans, it could result in job loss and economic disruption. Additionally, the reliance on technology may also lead to a decrease in manual skills and problem-solving abilities among workers, making them less adaptable to changing circumstances.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174153,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,economy
TopicOnTiles: Tile-Based Spatio-Temporal Event Analytics via Exclusive Topic Modeling on Social Media,"Detecting anomalous events of a particular area in a timely manner is an important task. Geo-tagged social media data are useful resource for this task; however, the abundance of everyday language in them makes this task still challenging. To address such challenges, we present TopicOnTiles, a visual analytics system that can reveal information relevant to anomalous events in a multi-level tile-based map interface by using social media data. To this end, we adopt and improve a recently proposed topic modeling method that can extract spatio-temporally exclusive topics corresponding to a particular region and a time point. Furthermore, we utilize a tile-based map interface to efficiently handle large-scale data in parallel. Our user interface effectively highlights anomalous tiles using our novel glyph visualization that encodes the degree of anomaly computed by our exclusive topic modeling processes. To show the effectiveness of our system, we present several usage scenarios using real-world datasets as well as comprehensive user study results.","

Mercury: A Messaging Framework for Modular UI Components,"In recent years, the entity--component--system pattern has become a fundamental feature of the software architectures of game-development environments such as Unity and Unreal, which are used extensively in developing 3D user interfaces. In these systems, UI components typically respond to events, requiring programmers to write application-specific callback functions. In some cases, components are organized in a hierarchy that is used to propagate events among vertically connected components. When components need to communicate horizontally, programmers must connect those components manually and register/unregister events as needed. Moreover, events and callback signatures may be incompatible, making modular UIs cumbersome to build and share within or across applications. To address these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, Mercury, to facilitate communication among components. We provide an overview of Mercury, outline its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using relay nodes, describe a reference implementation in Unity, and present example systems built using Mercury to explain its advantages.","

The use of 3D user interfaces in game-development environments like Unity and Unreal can lead to cumbersome and incompatible communication among components, making it difficult for programmers to build and share modular UIs within or across applications. This can result in wasted time and resources, as well as limitations in the functionality and scalability of the software.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174162,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Framed Guessability: Improving the Discoverability of Gestures and Body Movements for Full-Body Interaction,"The wide availability of body-sensing technologies (such as Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect) has the potential to bring full-body interaction to the masses, but the design of hand gestures and body movements that can be easily discovered by the users of such systems is still a challenge. In this paper, we revise and evaluate Framed Guessability, a design methodology for crafting discoverable hand gestures and body movements that focuses participants' suggestions within a ""frame,"" i.e. a scenario. We elicited gestures and body movements via the Guessability and the Framed Guessability methods, consulting 89 participants in-lab. We then conducted an in-situ quasi-experimental study with 138 museum visitors to compare the discoverability of gestures and body movements elicited with these two methods. We found that the Framed Guessability movements were more discoverable than those generated via traditional Guessability, even though in the museum there was no reference to the frame.","
The use of body-sensing technologies, such as Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect, can lead to a lack of discoverability of hand gestures and body movements, making it difficult for users to understand and use the technology effectively. This can result in frustration and dissatisfaction with the technology, leading to a negative experience for the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174167,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Two Kinds of Novel Multi-user Immersive Display Systems,"Stereoscopic display is a standard display mode for virtual reality environments. Typical 3D projection provides only a single stereoscopic video stream; thus co-located users cannot correctly perceive the virtual scene based on their own position and view. Several works devoted to developing multi-user stereoscopic display, but the number of users is very limited or the technical implementation is complicated. In this paper we put forward two flexible and simple projection-based multi-user stereoscopic display systems. The first one, named TPA, is based on a triple-projector array and provides a 120Hz active stereo for three users. Two TPAs can be combined to form a six-user system. The second one, named DPA, is a dual-projector and easy-implemented system providing individual stereoscopic video stream for two to six users. Finally, a co-located multi-user virtual fireman simulation training system and a virtual tennis simulation system were created to verify the effectiveness of our systems.","

The technology can only accommodate a limited number of users, making it difficult for larger groups to use simultaneously. Additionally, the technical implementation can be complicated, making it challenging for users to set up and use.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174173,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Full-Body Ownership Illusion Can Change Our Emotion,"Recent advances in technology have allowed users to experience an illusory feeling of full body ownership of a virtual avatar. Such virtual embodiment has the power to elicit perceptual, behavioral or cognitive changes related to oneself, however, its emotional effects have not yet been rigorously examined. To address this issue, we investigated emotional changes as a function of the level of the illusion (Study 1) and whether changes in the facial expression of a virtual avatar can modulate the effects of the illusion (Study 2). The results revealed that stronger illusory feelings of full body ownership were induced in the synchronous condition, and participants reported higher valence in the synchronous condition in both Studies 1 and 2. The results from Study 2 suggested that the facial expression of a virtual avatar can modulate participants' emotions. We discuss the prospects of the development of therapeutic techniques using such illusions to help people with emotion-related symptoms such as depression and social anxiety.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can create a false sense of ownership and emotional connection to a virtual avatar, potentially leading to decreased emotional connection to real-life experiences and relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174175,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
c.light: A Tool for Exploring Light Properties in Early Design Stage,"Although a light becomes an important design element, there are little techniques available to explore shapes and light effects in early design stages. We present c.light, a design tool that consists of a set of modules and a mobile application for visualizing the light in a physical world. It allows designers to easily fabricate both tangible and intangible properties of a light without a technical barrier. We analyzed how c.light contributes to the ideation process of light design through a workshop. The results showed that c.light largely expands designers' capability to manipulate intangible properties of light and, by doing so, it facilitates collaborative and inverted ideation process in early design stages. It is expected that the results of this study could enhance our understanding of how designers manipulate light in a physical world in early design stages and could be a good stepping stone for future tool development.","

The tool may lead to a lack of technical understanding and skills among designers, resulting in a reliance on technology rather than human expertise. This could lead to a loss of nuance and creativity in light design, as well as a potential loss of jobs for lighting designers. Additionally, the tool may also contribute to a lack of consideration for the physical and emotional impact of light on people, leading to potentially harmful or uncomfortable lighting designs.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174176,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
The Ethnobot: Gathering Ethnographies in the Age of IoT,"Computational systems and objects are becoming increasingly closely integrated with our daily activities. Ubiquitous and pervasive computing first identified the emerging challenges of studying technology used on-the-move and in widely varied contexts. With IoT, previously sporadic experiences are interconnected across time and space in numerous and complex ways. This increasing complexity has multiplied the challenges facing those who study human experience to inform design. This paper describes the results of a study that used a chatbot or 'Ethnobot' to gather ethnographic data, and considers the opportunities and challenges in collecting this data in the absence of a human ethnographer. This study involved 13 participants gathering information about their experiences at the Royal Highland Show. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Ethnobot in this setting, discuss the benefits and drawbacks of chatbots as a tool for ethnographic data collection, and conclude with recommendations for the design of chatbots for this purpose.","

The use of chatbots or ""Ethnobots"" for data collection can lead to a lack of human interaction and empathy, potentially resulting in a less nuanced understanding of human experiences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174178,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
"Personality Depends on The Medium: Differences in Self-Perception on Snapchat, Facebook and Offline","We investigate self-perception in social media through the lens of personality theory. Two mixed-methods studies involving 148 participants examine if people self-report different personality traits in social media compared with their offline traits. We first compare offline and Facebook traits, finding that on Facebook people are less Neurotic, Open and Agreeable. A second study compared offline, Facebook and Snapchat traits, replicating and extending our initial results. Again Facebook personality was less Neurotic and less Open than offline. In contrast, Snapchat personality was more Extravert than both offline and Facebook and more Open than Facebook. Interviews indicate how personality differences arise from social media affordances. Anxiety about audience judgments leads people to curate posts to appear less Neurotic on social media, but the transience of Snapchat promotes greater Extraversion than offline and Facebook. We discuss theory and design implications.","Social media platforms like Facebook and Snapchat can make people feel anxious about their online persona, leading them to present a curated version of themselves that is less authentic and less neurotic than their true personality.

Too Close and Crowded: Understanding Stress on Mobile Instant Messengers based on Proxemics,"Nowadays, mobile instant messaging (MIM) is a necessity for our private and public lives, but it has also been the cause of stress. In South Korea, MIM stress has become a serious social problem. To understand this stress, we conducted four focus groups with 20 participants under MIM stress. We initially discovered that MIM stress relates to how people perceive the territory in MIM. We then applied proxemics-the theory of human use of space-to the thematic analysis as the rationale. The data revealed two main themes: too close and too crowded. The participants were stressed due to design features that let strangers or crowds into their MIM applications and forced them to interact and share their status with them. Based on this finding, we propose a set of implications for designing anti-stress MIM applications.","Social Media technology causes stress due to design features that force users to interact with strangers and share their status, invading their personal space.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174189,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Socioeconomic Inequalities in the Non use of Facebook,"Use and non-use of technology can occur in a variety of forms. This paper analyzes data from a probabilistic sample of 1000 US households to identify predictors for four different types of use and non-use of the social media site Facebook. The results make three important contributions. First, they demonstrate that many demographic and socioeconomic predictors of social media use and non-use identified in prior studies hold with a larger, more diverse sample. Second, they show how going beyond a binary distinction between use and non-use reveals inequalities in social media use and non-use not identified in prior work. Third, they contribute to ongoing discussions about the representativeness of social media data by showing which populations are, and are not, represented in samples drawn from social media.",Inequalities in social media use and non-use.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174190,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Towards a Multisensory Augmented Reality Map for Blind and Low Vision People: a Participatory Design Approach,"Current low-tech Orientation & Mobility (O&M) tools for visually impaired people, e.g. tactile maps, possess limitations. Interactive accessible maps have been developed to overcome these. However, most of them are limited to exploration of existing maps, and have remained in laboratories. Using a participatory design approach, we have worked closely with 15 visually impaired students and 3 O&M instructors over 6 months. We iteratively designed and developed an augmented reality map destined at use in O&M classes in special education centers. This prototype combines projection, audio output and use of tactile tokens, and thus allows both map exploration and construction by low vision and blind people. Our user study demonstrated that all students were able to successfully use the prototype, and showed a high user satisfaction. A second phase with 22 international special education teachers allowed us to gain more qualitative insights. This work shows that augmented reality has potential for improving the access to education for visually impaired people.","

Regulating Feelings During Interpersonal Conflicts by Changing Voice Self-perception,"Emotions play a major role in how interpersonal conflicts unfold. Although several strategies and technological approaches have been proposed for emotion regulation, they often require conscious attention and effort. This often limits their efficacy in practice. In this paper, we propose a different approach inspired by self-perception theory: noticing that people are often reacting to the perception of their own behavior, we artificially change their perceptions to influence their emotions. We conducted two studies to evaluate the potential of this approach by automatically and subtly altering how people perceive their own voice. In one study, participants that received voice feedback with a calmer tone during relationship conflicts felt less anxious. In the other study, participants who listened to their own voices with a lower pitch during contentious debates felt more powerful. We discuss the implications of our findings and the opportunities for designing automatic and less perceptible emotion regulation systems.","

Flotation Simulation in a Cable-driven Virtual Environment -- A Study with Parasailing,"This paper presents flotation simulation in a cable-driven virtual environment. For this, a virtual parasailing system was developed, where the visual stimulus was provided through a VR headset and the physical stimulus was given by wires. In order to prevent the user from moving out of the limited workspace of the cable-driven system, the visual acceleration was washout-filtered to produce the physical acceleration. In the parasailing trajectory, we focused on the stages of vertical acceleration/deceleration and conducted an experiment to identify how much gain can be applied to the visual acceleration, which makes the user feel the natural self-motion when integrated with physical stimulus. Then, the results were tested using several types of full-course virtual parasailing. The results showed that fairly large differences between visual and physical stimuli would be accepted and different gains could be assigned depending on the user's altitudes.","Users may experience discomfort or disorientation due to differences between visual and physical stimuli in virtual environments, potentially leading to motion sickness or other adverse effects.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174206,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Identity Work as Deliberation: AAPI Political Discourse in the 2016 US Presidential Election,"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) are perceived as the ""model minority"" with a monolithic identity, in contrast to other marginalized racial groups in the United States. In reality, they are composed of different ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, and political ideologies. AAPIs share their political views online, engaging in the public sphere through a collaborative process we coin, ""identity work as deliberation."" Using the 2016 US Presidential Election as a case study, we retrieved 4,406 Reddit comments posted between October 2016 to December 2016. We examine how users engage in an online community through a deliberation lens to understand the extent to which Reddit supports identity work as a deliberative process. Under the collective AAPI umbrella, we find that ethnic identifications complicate the types of discussion possible within r/asianamerican. We discuss how the expression of identity, and thereby solidarity, in a politicized online setting may lead to a social movement.","Social Media platforms like Reddit can reinforce harmful stereotypes and limit the ability for marginalized groups to express their unique identities and experiences, leading to a lack of understanding and solidarity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174207,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Complex Mediation in the Formation of Political Opinions,"The Internet plays an important role in the formation of political opinions by supporting citizens in discovering diverse political information and opinions. However, the echo chamber effect has become of increasing concern, referring to the tendency for people to encounter opinions and information similar to their own online. It remains poorly understood how ordinary citizens use the Internet in the formation of political opinions. To answer this question, we conducted an interview study with 32 Chinese citizens. We found that participants used complex strategies to coordinate personal networks and technologies in specific ways to better understand political events. To analyze this phenomenon, we draw on Bødker and Andersen's model of complex mediation which describes how multiple mediators including people and artifacts work together to mediate an activity. We discuss how complex mediation supported participants in informing their political opinions. We derive design implications for supporting people to form political opinions.","Echo chamber effect, where people only encounter similar opinions and information online, leading to a lack of diversity in perspectives and potentially reinforcing existing biases.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174210,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Voice Interfaces in Everyday Life,"Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via 'assistant' devices. Yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. By collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the Amazon Echo in participants' homes-informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis-our study documents the methodical practices of VUI users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. Data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. We discuss how the VUI is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. Finally, we locate implications for the accountability of VUI interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing 'conversational' interfaces.","

The study found that the use of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) in homes can lead to a lack of accountability and coordination in conversational settings, such as family dinners. The device can disrupt the natural flow of conversation and create confusion about who is responsible for responding to requests.

Mental Health Support and its Relationship to Linguistic Accommodation in Online Communities,"Many online communities cater to the critical and unmet needs of individuals challenged with mental illnesses. Generally, communities engender characteristic linguistic practices, known as norms. Conformance to these norms, or linguistic accommodation, encourages social approval and acceptance. This paper investigates whether linguistic accommodation impacts a specific social feedback: the support received by an individual in an online mental health community. We first quantitatively derive two measures for each post in these communities: 1) the linguistic accommodation it exhibits, and 2) the level of support it receives. Thereafter, we build a statistical framework to examine the relationship between these measures. Although the extent to which accommodation is associated with support varies, we find a positive link between the two, consistent across 55 Reddit communities serving various psychological needs. We discuss how our work surfaces a tension in the functioning of these sensitive communities, and present design implications for improving their support provisioning mechanisms.","Social Media communities may inadvertently encourage conformity to certain language norms, which can create a tension between the need for social approval and the need for authentic expression, potentially impacting the level of support received by individuals.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174215,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Baang: A Viral Speech-based Social Platform for Under-Connected Populations,"Speech is more natural than text for a large part of the world including hard-to-reach populations (low-literate, poor, tech-novice, visually-impaired, marginalized) and oral cultures. Voice-based services over simple mobile phones are effective means to provide orality-driven social connectivity to such populations. We present Baang, a versatile and inclusive voice-based social platform that allows audio content creation and sharing among its open community of users. Within 8 months, Baang spread virally to 10,721 users (69% of them blind) who participated in 269,468 calls and shared their thoughts via 44,178 audio-posts, 343,542 votes, 124,389 audio-comments and 94,864 shares. We show that the ability to vote, comment and share leads to viral spread, deeper engagement, longer retention and emergence of true dialog among participants. Beyond connectivity, Baang provides its users with a voice and a social identity as well as means to share information and get community support.","
The article highlights the potential for voice-based social platforms to spread virally and engage users in oral cultures, but it also raises concerns about the impact on literacy and the potential for misinformation to spread.

Haptic Links: Bimanual Haptics for Virtual Reality Using Variable Stiffness Actuation,"We present Haptic Links, electro-mechanically actuated physical connections capable of rendering variable stiffness between two commodity handheld virtual reality (VR) controllers. When attached, Haptic Links can dynamically alter the forces perceived between the user's hands to support the haptic rendering of a variety of two-handed objects and interactions. They can rigidly lock controllers in an arbitrary configuration, constrain specific degrees of freedom or directions of motion, and dynamically set stiffness along a continuous range. We demonstrate and compare three prototype Haptic Links: Chain, Layer-Hinge, and Ratchet-Hinge. We then describe interaction techniques and scenarios leveraging the capabilities of each.

Selection-based Text Entry in Virtual Reality,"In recent years, Virtual Reality (VR) and 3D User Interfaces (3DUI) have seen a drastic increase in popularity, especially in terms of consumer-ready hardware and software. While the technology for input as well as output devices is market ready, only a few solutions for text input exist, and empirical knowledge about performance and user preferences is lacking. In this paper, we study text entry in VR by selecting characters on a virtual keyboard. We discuss the design space for assessing selection-based text entry in VR. Then, we implement six methods that span different parts of the design space and evaluate their performance and user preferences. Our results show that pointing using tracked hand-held controllers outperforms all other methods. Other methods such as head pointing can be viable alternatives depending on available resources. We summarize our findings by formulating guidelines for choosing optimal virtual keyboard text entry methods in VR.","

The Effect of Offset Correction and Cursor on Mid-Air Pointing in Real and Virtual Environments,"Pointing at remote objects to direct others' attention is a fundamental human ability. Previous work explored methods for remote pointing to select targets. Absolute pointing techniques that cast a ray from the user to a target are affected by humans' limited pointing accuracy. Recent work suggests that accuracy can be improved by compensating systematic offsets between targets a user aims at and rays cast from the user to the target. In this paper, we investigate mid-air pointing in the real world and virtual reality. Through a pointing study, we model the offsets to improve pointing accuracy and show that being in a virtual environment affects how users point at targets. In the second study, we validate the developed model and analyze the effect of compensating systematic offsets. We show that the provided model can significantly improve pointing accuracy when no cursor is provided. We further show that a cursor improves pointing accuracy but also increases the selection time.","

"CLAW: A Multifunctional Handheld Haptic Controller for Grasping, Touching, and Triggering in Virtual Reality","CLAW is a handheld virtual reality controller that augments the typical controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. Our controller enables three distinct interactions (grasping virtual object, touching virtual surfaces, and triggering) and changes its corresponding haptic rendering by sensing the differences in the user's grasp. A servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. Using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement. CLAW also supports a haptic force feedback in the trigger mode when the user holds a gun. We describe the design considerations for CLAW and evaluate its performance through two user studies.

Combating Attrition in Digital Self-Improvement Programs using Avatar Customization,"Digital self-improvement programs (e.g., interventions, training programs, self-help apps) are widely accessible, but can not employ the same degree of external regulation as programs delivered in controlled environments. As a result, they suffer from high attrition -- even the best programs won't work if people don't use them. We propose that volitional engagement -- facilitated through avatar customization -- can help combat attrition. We asked 250 participants to engage daily for 3 weeks in a one-minute breathing exercise for anxiety reduction, using either a generic avatar or one that they customized. Customizing an avatar resulted in significantly less attrition and more sustained engagement as measured through login counts. The problem of attrition affects self-improvement programs across a range of do-mains; we provide a subtle, versatile, and broadly-applicable solution.","High attrition rate in digital self-improvement programs.

Norms Matter: Contrasting Social Support Around Behavior Change in Online Weight Loss Communities,"Online health communities (OHCs) provide support across conditions; for weight loss, OHCs offer support to foster positive behavior change. However, weight loss behaviors can also be subverted on OHCs to promote disordered eating practices. Using comments as proxies for support, we use computational linguistic methods to juxtapose similarities and differences in two Reddit weight loss communities, r/proED and r/loseit. We employ language modeling and find that word use in both communities is largely similar. Then, by building a word embedding model, specifically a deep neural network on comment words, we contrast the context of word use and find differences that imply different behavior change goals in these OHCs. Finally, these content and context norms predict whether a comment comes from r/proED or r/loseit. We show that norms matter in understanding how different OHCs provision support to promote behavior change and discuss the implications for design and moderation of OHCs.","Social media platforms can promote disordered eating practices and support harmful behavior change goals, despite their potential to foster positive change.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3174240,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
"What Makes Live Events Engaging on Facebook Live, Periscope, and Snapchat","Live streaming platforms bring events from all around the world to people's computing devices. We conducted a mixed methods study including interviews (N = 42) and a survey (N = 223) to understand how people currently experience events using Facebook Live, Periscope, and Snapchat Live Stories. We identified four dimensions that make remote event viewing engaging: immersion, immediacy, interaction, and sociality. We find that both live streams and the more curated event content found on Snapchat are immersive and immediate, yet Snapchat Live Stories enable quickly switching among different views of the event. Live streams, on the other hand, offer real time interaction and sociality in a way that Snapchat Live Stories do not. However, the interaction's impact depends on comment volume, comment content, and relationship between viewer and broadcaster. We describe how people experience events remotely using these social media, and identify design opportunities around detecting exciting content, leveraging multiple viewpoints, and enabling interactivity to create engaging user experiences for remotely participating in events.","Social Media platforms can make people feel like they are participating in events remotely, but in reality, they are not fully immersed in the experience.

Modeling and Understanding Visual Attributes of Mental Health Disclosures in Social Media,"Content shared on social media platforms has been identified to be valuable in gaining insights into people's mental health experiences. Although there has been widespread adoption of photo-sharing platforms such as Instagram in recent years, the role of visual imagery as a mechanism of self-disclosure is less understood. We study the nature of visual attributes manifested in images relating to mental health disclosures on Instagram. Employing computer vision techniques on a corpus of thousands of posts, we extract and examine three visual attributes: visual features (e.g., color), themes, and emotions in images. Our findings indicate the use of imagery for unique self-disclosure needs, quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from those shared via the textual modality: expressions of emotional distress, calls for help, and explicit display of vulnerability. We discuss the relationship of our findings to literature in visual sociology, in mental health self disclosure, and implications for the design of health interventions.","Social media platforms can be harmful to mental health as people may use visual imagery to express emotional distress, call for help, or display vulnerability in ways that are not healthy or productive.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025932,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
The Social Lives of Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can affect all aspects of an individual's life, including physical ability, communication, and mental health, and present chronic health conditions that persist throughout the lifespan. Although prior work documents a decrease in social interaction following brain injury, little is known about how individuals with TBI engage in social behavior during their recovery, how others in their lives participate, and how these interactions occur in both online and offline contexts. We examine these issues through an interview study involving individuals with TBI, as well as caregivers and social contacts of individuals with TBI. Our analysis identifies the concept of social re-emergence, a non-linear process of developing a new social identity that involves withdrawing from social life, developing goals for social participation, disclosing health information for social support and acceptance, and attaining social independence.","Social Media can lead to social isolation and withdrawal from real-life social interactions, which can negatively impact mental health and overall well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025784,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
All about Acceptability?: Identifying Factors for the Adoption of Data Glasses,"Innovations often trigger objections before becoming widely accepted. This paper assesses whether a familiarisation over time can be expected for data glasses, too. While user attitudes towards those devices have been reported to be prevalently negative [14], it is still unclear, to what extent this initial, negative user attitude might impede adoption. However, indepth understanding is crucial for reducing barriers early in order to gain access to potential benefits from the technology. With this paper we contribute to a better understanding of factors affecting data glasses adoption, as well as current trends and opinions. Our multiple-year case study (N=118) shows, against expectations, no significant change towards a more positive attitude between 2014 and 2016. We complement these findings with an expert survey (N=51) investigating prognoses, challenges and discussing the relevance of social acceptability. We elicit and contrast a controversial spectrum of expert opinions, and assess whether initial objections can be overwritten. Our analysis shows that while social acceptability is considered relevant for the time being, utility and usability are more valued for long-term adoption.","People may have negative attitudes towards Augmented/Virtual Reality technology, which could impede its adoption and prevent people from experiencing its potential benefits.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025749,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Teaching Language and Culture with a Virtual Reality Game,"Many people want to learn a language but find it difficult to stay engaged. Ideally, we would have language learning tools that can make language learning more enjoyable by simulating immersion in a foreign language environment. Therefore, we adapted Crystallize, a 3D video game for learning Japanese, so that it can be played in virtual reality with the Oculus Rift. Specifically, we explored whether we could leverage virtual reality technology to teach embodied cultural interaction, such as bowing in Japanese greetings. To evaluate the impact of our virtual reality game designs, we conducted a formative user study with 68 participants. We present results showing that the virtual reality design trained players how and when to bow, and that it increased participants' sense of involvement in Japanese culture. Our results suggest that virtual reality technology provides an opportunity to leverage culturally-relevant physical interaction, which can enhance the design of language learning technology and virtual reality games.","

Managing Uncertainty in Time Expressions for Virtual Assistants,"""Remind me to get milk later this afternoon."" In communications and planning, people often express uncertainty about time using imprecise temporal expressions (ITEs). Unfortunately, modern virtual assistants often lack system support to capture the intents behind these expressions. This can result in unnatural interactions and undesirable interruptions (e.g., having a work reminder delivered at 12pm when out at lunch, because the user said ""this afternoon""). In this paper we explore existing practices, expectations, and preferences surrounding the use of ITEs. Our mixed methods approach employs surveys, interviews, and an analysis of a large corpus of written communications. We find that people frequently use a diverse set of ITEs in both communication and planning. These uses reflect a variety of motivations, such as conveying uncertainty or task priority. In addition, we find that people have a variety of expectations about time input and management when interacting with virtual assistants. We conclude with design implications for future virtual assistants.",Interruptions and unnatural interactions with virtual assistants due to lack of understanding of imprecise temporal expressions.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025674,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
"Comparing Social Robot, Screen and Voice Interfaces for Smart-Home Control","With domestic technology on the rise, the quantity and complexity of smart-home devices are becoming an important interaction design challenge. We present a novel design for a home control interface in the form of a social robot, commanded via tangible icons and giving feedback through expressive gestures. We experimentally compare the robot to three common smart-home interfaces: a voice-control loudspeaker; a wall-mounted touch-screen; and a mobile application. Our findings suggest that interfaces that rate higher on flow rate lower on usability, and vice versa. Participants' sense of control is highest using familiar interfaces, and lowest using voice control. Situation awareness is highest using the robot, and also lowest using voice control. These findings raise questions about voice control as a smart-home interface, and suggest that embodied social robots could provide for an engaging interface with high situation awareness, but also that their usability remains a considerable design challenge.","Voice Assistant technology may lead to a decrease in situation awareness and sense of control for users, compared to other interfaces such as touch-screen or social robots.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025786,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
WatchThru: Expanding Smartwatch Displays with Mid-air Visuals and Wrist-worn Augmented Reality,"We introduce WatchThru, an interactive method for extended wrist-worn display on commercially-available smartwatches. To address the limited visual and interaction space, WatchThru expands the device into 3D through a transparent display. This enables novel interactions that leverage and extend smartwatch glanceability. We describe three novel interaction techniques, Pop-up Visuals, Second Perspective and Peek-through, and discuss how they can complement interaction on current devices. We also describe two types of prototypes that helped us to explore standalone interactions, as well as, proof-of-concept AR interfaces using our platform.","

The technology described in the article, specifically the use of transparent displays, could lead to a decrease in privacy for the user. With the ability to display information and images in 3D, there is a risk that personal information could be easily accessed and viewed by others without the user's knowledge or consent. This could be particularly problematic in situations where sensitive information is being displayed, such as financial information or personal messages. Additionally, the use of this technology could also lead to an increase in distractions and decreased productivity, as users may be tempted to constantly interact with the virtual displays rather than focusing on the task at hand.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025852,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
"""WhatsApp is for family; Messenger is for friends"": Communication Places in App Ecosystems","Today's users communicate via multiple apps, even when they offer almost identical functionality. We studied how and why users distribute their contacts within their app ecosystem. We found that the contacts in an app affect a user's conversations with other contacts, their communication patterns in the app, and the quality of their social relationships. Users appropriate the features and technical constraints of their apps to create idiosyncratic communication places, each with its own recursively defined membership rules, perceived purposes, and emotional connotations. Users also shift the boundaries of their communication places to accommodate changes in their contacts' behaviour, the dynamics of their relationships, and the restrictions of the technology. We argue that communication apps should support creating multiple communication places within the same app, relocating conversations across apps, and accessing functionality from other apps.","Social media technology can lead to fragmentation of communication and relationships, as users are spread across multiple apps with similar functionality, leading to a lack of cohesion and consistency in communication.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025484,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
I Need Your Encouragement!: Requesting Supportive Comments on Social Media Reduces Test Anxiety,"Many students underperform on exams due to experiencing high test anxiety. We report on a study comparing a novel intervention of seeking support from one's social network to the more common approaches of expressive writing and studying task-relevant materials for simulated open-ended test questions. We measured in-the-moment (state) anxiety before and after each intervention, and correctness of the solutions. We also surveyed students to learn about their perceptions of the interventions. Our results showed that social support decreased the anxiety of high test-anxious students by 21% with the reduction in anxiety correlating with the number of messages received. Social support also allowed high test-anxious students to score at the level of low test-anxious students. Expressive writing showed a similar effect, but increased the anxiety of low test-anxious students by 61%. Studying task materials had no effect on anxiety and high test-anxious students performed worse than low test-anxious students. Despite benefiting from social support, we found that students were uncomfortable soliciting support from their online social network. Realizing the benefits of this approach may therefore require different formulations of social support in practice.",Social Media can increase anxiety of low test-anxious students by 61% when using expressive writing as an intervention.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025709,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
"Goodbye Text, Hello Emoji: Mobile Communication on WeChat in China","We present a qualitative study of mobile communication via WeChat in Southern China, focusing on the rapid proliferation of emoji and stickers and the lessening dependence on text. We use interview and observation data from 30 participants to investigate how rural, small town, and urban Chinese adults creatively and innovatively balance the use of emoji, stickers, and text in their mobile communication practices. We also discuss design implications of our research for the field of HCI, offering ways of leveraging the non-textual communication practices that we uncover, in scenarios where purely text-based communication may not suffice.","The overuse of emojis and stickers in mobile communication can lead to a decrease in the use of text, resulting in a loss of nuance and depth in communication.

HOBIT: Hybrid Optical Bench for Innovative Teaching,"Practical work in optics allows supporting the construction of knowledge, in particular when the concept to be learned remains diffuse. To overcome the limitations of the current experimental setups, we have designed a hybrid system that combines physical interaction and numerical simulation. This system relies on 3D-printed replicas of optical elements, which are augmented with pedagogical information. In this paper, we focus on the well-known Michelson interferometer experiment, widely studied in undergraduate programs of Science. A 3-months user study with 101 students and 6 teachers showed that, beyond the practical aspects offered by this system, such an approach enhances the technical and scientific learning compared to a standard Michelson interferometer experiment.","

The use of 3D-printed replicas of optical elements in a hybrid system that combines physical interaction and numerical simulation can lead to a lack of understanding of the underlying scientific principles.

"The Effect of Population and ""Structural"" Biases on Social Media-based Algorithms: A Case Study in Geolocation Inference Across the Urban-Rural Spectrum","Much research has shown that social media platforms have substantial population biases. However, very little is known about how these population biases affect the many algorithms that rely on social media data. Focusing on the case study of geolocation inference algorithms and their performance across the urban-rural spectrum, we establish that these algorithms exhibit significantly worse performance for underrepresented populations (i.e. rural users). We further establish that this finding is robust across both text- and network-based algorithm designs. However, we also show that some of this bias can be attributed to the design of algorithms themselves rather than population biases in the underlying data sources. For instance, in some cases, algorithms perform badly for rural users even when we substantially overcorrect for population biases by training exclusively on rural data. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design and study of social media-based algorithms.","Social media algorithms may be biased against underrepresented populations, such as rural users, leading to poor performance and inaccurate results.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026015,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
The Geography of Pokémon GO: Beneficial and Problematic Effects on Places and Movement,"The widespread popularity of Pokémon GO presents the first opportunity to observe the geographic effects of location-based gaming at scale. This paper reports the results of a mixed methods study of the geography of Pokémon GO that includes a five-country field survey of 375 Pokémon GO players and a large scale geostatistical analysis of game elements. Focusing on the key geographic themes of places and movement, we find that the design of Pokémon GO reinforces existing geographically-linked biases (e.g. the game advantages urban areas and neighborhoods with smaller minority populations), that Pokémon GO may have instigated a relatively rare large-scale shift in global human mobility patterns, and that Pokémon GO has geographically-linked safety risks, but not those typically emphasized by the media. Our results point to geographic design implications for future systems in this space such as a means through which the geographic biases present in Pokémon GO may be counteracted.","Reinforcement of existing geographically-linked biases, such as favoring urban areas and neighborhoods with smaller minority populations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025495,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Augmented Studio: Projection Mapping on Moving Body for Physiotherapy Education,"Physiotherapy students often struggle to translate anatomical knowledge from textbooks into a dynamic understanding of the mechanics of body movements in real life patients. We present the Augmented Studio, an augmented reality system that uses body tracking to project anatomical structures and annotations over moving bodies for physiotherapy education. Through a user and learner centered design approach, we established an understanding that through augmentation and annotation, augmented reality technology can enhance physiotherapy education. Augmented Studio enables augmentation through projection mapping to display anatomical information such as muscles and skeleton in real time on the body as it moves. We created a technique for annotation to create projected hand-drawing on the moving body, to enable explicit communication of the teacher's clinical reasoning strategies to the students. Findings from our pilot usability study demonstrate a more engaging learning and teaching experience and increased communication between teacher and students when using Augmented Studio.","

* Over-reliance on technology: The use of augmented reality technology in physiotherapy education may lead to an over-reliance on technology, potentially diminishing the importance of hands-on learning and practical experience.

Insight:

* The use of augmented reality technology in physiotherapy education may lead to a decrease in the amount of practical experience and hands-on learning for students, as they may become too reliant on technology to provide them with the information they need.

Facilitating Development of Pragmatic Competence through a Voice-driven Video Learning Interface,"Authentic foreign language videos are effective for developing pragmatic competence, or sensitivity to meanings expressed by tone and word choice, and the ability to effectively express these meanings. However, established methods for learning from foreign language videos are primarily text-based (e.g.captioning). Using text, learners do not practice aspects of oral performance (e.g. intonation, pausing, and pitch) that are important to pragmatic competence. In this paper we present a voice-driven system where learners practice and learn a foreign language by repeating phrases out loud from any video. Utterances are transcribed and translated and, if captions are available, the system indicates the correctness of the utterance. In an evaluation with 27 participants, we show that participants more frequently used the voice-driven system than a comparison text-based system. Furthermore, ina field study of 130 independent learners, we show potential for community-driven resource collection.","

The use of voice-driven systems for language learning may lead to a lack of practice in reading and writing skills, as learners rely solely on speaking and listening. This could result in a decrease in literacy abilities and a reliance on technology for communication, rather than developing a well-rounded set of language skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025805,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Inner Garden: Connecting Inner States to a Mixed Reality Sandbox for Mindfulness,"Digital technology has been completely integrated into our daily lives, yet the potential of technology to improve its users' life satisfaction is still largely untapped. Mindfulness, the act of paying a deliberate and non-judgmental attention to the present moment, has been shown to have a positive impact on a person's health and subjective well-being--commonly called ""happiness"". Based on an iterative process with meditation teachers and practitioners, we designed a new tool to support mindfulness practices. This tool takes the shape of an augmented sandbox, designed to inspire the user's self-motivation and curiosity. By shaping the sand, the user creates a living miniature world that is projected back onto the sand. The natural elements of the garden are connected to real-time physiological measurements, such as breathing, helping the user to stay focused on the body. Moreover, using a Virtual Reality headset, they can travel inside their garden for a dedicated meditation session. Preliminary results seem to indicate that the system is well suited for mindfulness and induces a calm and mindful state on the user. The meditation teachers envisioned the use of Inner Garden in their practice.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology for mindfulness practices may lead to a dependence on technology for achieving a meditative state, rather than developing the ability to cultivate mindfulness independently. This could result in a decrease in self-awareness and self-regulation skills, as well as a loss of connection with the natural world. Additionally, the use of physiological measurements to control the virtual environment could raise privacy concerns and create a sense of surveillance.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025743,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Providing Haptics to Walls & Heavy Objects in Virtual Reality by Means of Electrical Muscle Stimulation,"We explore how to add haptics to walls and other heavy objects in virtual reality. When a user tries to push such an object, our system actuates the user's shoulder, arm, and wrist muscles by means of electrical muscle stimulation, creating a counter force that pulls the user's arm backwards. Our device accomplishes this in a wearable form factor. In our first user study, participants wearing a head-mounted display interacted with objects provided with different types of EMS effects. The repulsion design (visualized as an electrical field) and the soft design (visualized as a magnetic field) received high scores on ""prevented me from passing through"" as well as ""realistic"".

It wasn't really about the Pokémon: Parents' Perspectives on a Location-Based Mobile Game,"Though prior work shows parents worry about screen media experiences displacing physical activity and time outdoors, this research does not account for location-based mobile games like Pokémon GO, which specifically facilitate outdoor activity. To fill this gap in the research, we surveyed and interviewed parents to understand (1) their values and perceptions of this type of gameplay and (2) how they co-play Pokémon GO with their children. Our findings provide empirical evidence that, in addition to appreciating the increased exercise and time outdoors, parents valued how play led to family bonding experiences. Furthermore, some traditional concerns about screen time persisted in this context, and new concerns about safety in real-world environments emerged. Parents mitigated these concerns with rules and gameplay choices, such as maintaining control of the mobile device, to ensure children were safe. This work contributes an empirical understanding of families as co-users of technology and offers a generative lens to study and design for joint media engagement among family members where gameplay differs from normative notions of screen time.","Parents' concerns about safety in real-world environments emerged as children played location-based mobile games like Pokémon GO, which led to new rules and gameplay choices to ensure children's safety.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025761,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Ways of Spectating: Unravelling Spectator Participation in Kinect Play,"We explore spectating on video game play as an interactional and participatory activity. Drawing on a corpus of video recordings capturing 'naturally occurring' Kinect gaming within home settings, we detail how the analytic 'work' of spectating is interactionally accomplished as a matter of collaborative action with players and engagement in the game. We examine: spectators supporting players with continuous 'scaffolding'; spectators critiquing player technique during and between moments of play; spectators recognising and complimenting competent player conduct; and spectators reflecting on prior play to build instructions for the player. From this we draw out a number of points that shift the conversation in HCI about 'the spectator' towards understanding and designing for spectating as an interactional activity; that is, sequentially ordered and temporally coordinated. We also discuss bodily conduct and the particular ways of 'seeing' involved in spectating, and conclude with remarks on conceptual and design implications for HCI.","People may become too focused on watching others play video games, rather than engaging in the game themselves or participating in other activities.

"""These are not my hands!"": Effect of Gender on the Perception of Avatar Hands in Virtual Reality","Rendering the user's body in virtual reality increases immersion and presence the illusion of ""being there"". Recent technology enables determining the pose and position of the hands to render them accordingly while interacting within the virtual environment. Virtual reality applications often use realistic male or female hands, mimic robotic hands, or cartoon hands. However, it is unclear how users perceive different hand styles. We conducted a study with 14 male and 14 female participants in virtual reality to investigate the effect of gender on the perception of six different hands. Quantitative and qualitative results show that women perceive lower levels of presence while using male avatar hands and male perceive lower levels of presence using non-human avatar hands. While women dislike male hands, men accept and feel presence with avatar hands of both genders. Our results highlight the importance of considering the users' diversity when designing virtual reality experiences.","Users may feel less immersed and present in virtual reality experiences if the avatar hands do not match their gender or are non-human, which could affect the overall effectiveness of the technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025602,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Looking Inside the Wires: Understanding Museum Visitor Learning with an Augmented Circuit Exhibit,"Understanding electrical circuits can be difficult for novices of all ages. In this paper, we describe a science museum exhibit that enables visitors to make circuits on an interactive tabletop and observe a simulation of electrons flowing through the circuit. Our goal is to use multiple representations to help convey basic concepts of current and resistance. To study visitor interaction and learning, we tested the design at a popular science museum with 60 parent-child dyads in three conditions: a control condition with no electron simulation; a condition with the simulation displayed alongside the circuit on the same screen; and an augmented reality condition, with the simulation displayed on a tablet that acts as a lens to see into the circuit. Our findings show that children did significantly better on a post-test in both experimental conditions, with children performing best in the AR condition. However, analysis of session videos shows unexpected parent-child collaboration in the AR condition.","

The study found that children who used the augmented reality (AR) condition to learn about electrical circuits performed better on a post-test compared to those in the control condition. However, the study also found that the AR condition led to unexpected parent-child collaboration, which could potentially undermine the learning experience for the children.

A Social Media Based Index of Mental Well-Being in College Campuses,"Psychological distress in the form of depression, anxiety and other mental health challenges among college students is a growing health concern. Dearth of accurate, continuous, and multi-campus data on mental well-being presents significant challenges to intervention and mitigation efforts in college campuses. We examine the potential of social media as a new ""barometer"" for quantifying the mental well-being of college populations. Utilizing student-contributed data in Reddit communities of over 100 universities, we first build and evaluate a transfer learning based classification approach that can detect mental health expressions with 97% accuracy.

We discuss the implications of our work for improving counselor efforts, and in the design of tools that can enable better assessment of the mental health climate of college campuses.","Social media can be a barometer for mental well-being, but it can also contribute to psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges among college students.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025909,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
When Fitness Meets Social Networks: Investigating Fitness Tracking and Social Practices on WeRun,"The last two decades have seen growing interest in promoting physical activities by using self-tracking technologies. Previous work has identified social interactions in self-tracking as a crucial factor in motivating users to exercise.

In this research, we address this gap through a qualitative study of 32 users of WeRun--a fitness plugin of the widely adopted Chinese mobile social networking service WeChat. Our findings indicate that sharing fitness data with pre-existing social networks motivates users to continue self-tracking and enhances their existing social relationships. Nevertheless, users' concerns about their online personal images lead to challenges around privacy.

"""Be Grateful You Don't Have a Real Disease"": Understanding Rare Disease Relationships","We characterize how people with rare diseases consider their support needs as being met or neglected by different sources. After a 22-week study with 11 participants, we found that people with rare diseases identify strongly with their conditions but demonstrate a range of outlooks on their condition (positive, negative, and accepting). We found that participants think of themselves as being in a separate ""Rare World"" from the ""normal"" people in their lives and that relationships with friends and family members are strained. On the other hand, online communities were described as valuable sources of many forms of support, but do not adequately compensate for the lack of tangible support in offline relationships. We propose an approach to facilitating tangible support that leverages existing research on social matching, towards facilitating support among people with different rare diseases to overcome geographic and symptomatic challenges of coordinating support between people with the same rare disease.","Social Media can create a sense of isolation and disconnection from ""normal"" people in the lives of those with rare diseases, despite the benefits of online communities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025796,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
When Personal Tracking Becomes Social: Examining the Use of Instagram for Healthy Eating,"Many people appropriate social media and online communities in their pursuit of personal health goals, such as healthy eating or increased physical activity. However, people struggle with impression management, and with reaching the right audiences when they share health information on these platforms. Instagram, a popular photo-based social media platform, has attracted many people who post and share their food photos. We aim to inform the design of tools to support healthy behaviors by understanding how people appropriate Instagram to track and share food data, the benefits they obtain from doing so, and the challenges they encounter. We interviewed 16 women who consistently record and share what they eat on Instagram. Participants tracked to support themselves and others in their pursuit of healthy eating goals. They sought social support for their own tracking and healthy behaviors and strove to provide that support for others. People adapted their personal tracking practices to better receive and give this support.

Ambiotherm: Enhancing Sense of Presence in Virtual Reality by Simulating Real-World Environmental Conditions,"In this paper, we present and evaluate Ambiotherm, a wearable accessory for Head Mounted Displays (HMD) that provides thermal and wind stimuli to simulate real-world environmental conditions, such as ambient temperatures and wind conditions, to enhance the sense of presence in Virtual Reality (VR). Ambiotherm consists of a Ambient Temperature Module that is attached to the user's neck, a Wind Simulation Module focused towards the user's face, and a Control Module utilizing Bluetooth communication. We demonstrate Ambiotherm with two VR environments, a hot desert, and a snowy mountain, to showcase the different types of simulated environmental conditions. We conduct several studies to 1) address design factors of the system and 2) evaluate Ambiotherm's effect on factors related to a user's sense of presence. Our findings show that the addition of wind and thermal stimuli significantly improves sensory and realism factors, contributing towards an enhanced sense of presence when compared to traditional VR experiences.","

The use of Ambiotherm, a wearable accessory for Head Mounted Displays (HMD) that provides thermal and wind stimuli to simulate real-world environmental conditions, may lead to a decrease in the user's awareness of their surroundings, causing them to become disconnected from reality.

"Respeak: A Voice-based, Crowd-powered Speech Transcription System","Speech transcription is an expensive service with high turnaround time for audio files containing languages spoken in developing countries and regional accents of well-represented languages. We present Respeak - a voice-based, crowd-powered system that capitalizes on the strengths of crowdsourcing and automatic speech recognition (instead of typing) to transcribe such audio files. We created Respeak and optimized its design through a series of cognitive experiments. We deployed it with 25 university students in India who completed 5464 micro-transcription tasks, transcribing 55 minutes of widely-varied audio content, and collectively earning USD 46 as mobile airtime. The Respeak engine aligned the transcript generated by five randomly selected users to transcribe Hindi and Indian English audio files with a word error rate (WER) of 8.6% and 15.2%, respectively. The cost of speech transcription was USD 0.83 per minute with a turnaround time of 39.8 hours, substantially less than industry standards. Using a mixed-methods analysis of cognitive experiments, system performance and qualitative interviews, we evaluate Respeak's design, user experience, strengths, and weaknesses. Our findings suggest that Respeak improves the quality of speech transcription while enhancing the earning potential of low-income populations in resource-constrained settings.","The use of crowdsourcing for speech transcription can lead to low-quality transcripts, potentially perpetuating stereotypes and biases present in the data used to train the system.

Inferring Motion Direction using Commodity Wi-Fi for Interactive Exergames,"In-air interaction acts as a key enabler for ambient intelligence and augmented reality. As an increasing popular example, exergames, and the alike gesture recognition applications, have attracted extensive research in designing accurate, pervasive and low-cost user interfaces. Recent advances in wireless sensing show promise for a ubiquitous gesture-based interaction interface with Wi-Fi. In this work, we extract complete information of motion-induced Doppler shifts with only commodity Wi-Fi. The key insight is to harness antenna diversity to carefully eliminate random phase shifts while retaining relevant Doppler shifts. We further correlate Doppler shifts with motion directions, and propose a light-weight pipeline to detect, segment, and recognize motions without training. On this basis, we present WiDance, a Wi-Fi-based user interface, which we utilize to design and prototype a contactless dance-pad exergame. Experimental results in typical indoor environment demonstrate a superior performance with an accuracy of 92%, remarkably outperforming prior approaches.","

Be Me or Be Mii?: A Study of Self-Presentation and Interaction in the Miitomo Mobile Application,"In this study, we consider what Nintendo's widely downloaded Miitomo mobile application, which simultaneously promotes non-idealized self-fictionalization and authentic self-presentation, can suggest to us about self-presentation and technology design. Ten groups of four friends each (N=40), all novice users, engaged with Miitomo for one week, and completed supplementary pre- and post-use surveys. The data were analyzed to assess the extent to which participants' engagement in Miitomo reflected their ""real life"" selves and correlated with in-app and ""real life"" features, respectively. Although most participants believed that their behaviors within the app accurately reflected their ""true selves,"" we found that in-app traits generally correlated more strongly with Miitomo engagement patterns than did users' ""real life"" traits and qualities. We discuss implications for social network and online community design, and propose future plans to study authenticity and self-distancing in online self-presentation.","Social Media platforms like Miitomo can create a false sense of authenticity, leading users to present an idealized version of themselves online that is not reflective of their true selves.

Deconstructing Cosmetic Virtual Goods Experiences in Dota 2,"Cosmetic items do not provide functional advantages in games, but, nevertheless, they play an important role in the overall player experience. Possessing predominantly socially-constructed dimensions of value, cosmetic items are chosen, discussed, assessed, and valuated in an ongoing iterative collaborative process by communities of players. In our study, we explore the case of Dota 2 and apply Topic Modeling to community-discussions data gathered from Reddit.com. We describe social experiences related to the valuation of cosmetic items in interaction and collision of various logics, including artificial scarcity, decomposition of visual effects, and connectedness to the game lore. Our findings connect the collective experience of players in the game and on online community platforms, suggesting that non-utility-based social value construction becomes an important part of game experience.","Social media platforms like Reddit can contribute to the creation and perpetuation of artificial scarcity and socially-constructed value systems, which can lead to unhealthy obsessions and negative impacts on mental health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025893,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Toward Harmonizing Self-reported and Logged Social Data for Understanding Human Behavior,"While self-reporting remains the most common method to understand human behavior, recent advances in social networks, mobile technologies, and other computer-mediated communication technologies are allowing researchers to obtain detailed logs of human behavior with ease. While the logged data is very useful (and accurate) at capturing the structure of the user's social network, the self-reported data provides an insight into the user's cognitive map of her social network. Based on a field study involving 47 users for a period of ten weeks we report that combining the two sets of data (self-reported and logged) gives higher predictive power than using either one of them individually. Further, the difference between the two types of values captures the level of dissonance between a user's actual and perceived social behavior and is found to be an important predictor of the person's social outcomes including social capital, social support and trust.","Social media technology can create a disconnect between a person's actual and perceived social behavior, leading to negative social outcomes such as decreased social capital, support, and trust.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025856,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
"""I've been manipulated!"": Designing Second Screen Experiences for Critical Viewing of Reality TV","The recent proliferation of a reality TV genre that focusses on welfare recipients has led to concerns that prime-time media experiences are exacerbating misconceptions, and stifling critical debate, around major societal issues such as welfare reform and poverty. Motivated by arguments that 'second screening' practices offer opportunities to engage viewers with issues of political concern, we describe the design and evaluation of two smartphone apps that facilitate and promote more critical live-viewing of reality TV. Our apps, Spotting Guide and Moral Compass, encourage users to identify, categorise, tag and filter patterns and tropes within reality TV, as well as reinterpret social media posts associated with their broadcast. We show that such interactions encourage critical thinking around typical editing and production techniques and foster co-discussion and reflection amongst viewers. We discuss, more broadly, how these interactions encourage users to identify the wider consequences and framings of reality TV, and offer implications and considerations for design that provokes criticality and reflection in second screening contexts.","Reality TV shows about welfare recipients can reinforce negative stereotypes and stifle meaningful discussion about poverty and welfare reform.

Empowered Participation: How Citizens Use Technology in Local Governance,"The partnership between local residents and city officials to inform policy and decision-making about government resources, or participatory governance, has been extensively studied. In addition to numerous ethnographic studies about how citizens engage in-person, there has been increased focus in HCI to understand the impact of technology on citizen participation in local governance. Building upon those studies, this paper provides unique insight from a 3-year longitudinal study on the use of online tools that were organically adapted by citizens to engage in local governance in three diverse Chicago neighborhoods. Though the responsiveness of government officials varied across communities, our results suggest that citizens use technology to heighten the visibility of their concerns, to support mechanisms of government accountability, and to provide various options for resident participation in local governance. We argue that while communities may be effective in their use of ICTs, technology may not increase their political power.","Social Media technology may not increase citizens' political power despite their effective use of it to engage in local governance, as government officials' responsiveness varies and technology may not necessarily lead to real change.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025996,Social Media,CHI,politics
Embedding a Crowd inside a Relay Baton: A Case Study in a Non-Competitive Sporting Activity,"This paper presents a digital relay baton that connects long-distance runners with distributed online spectators. The baton broadcasts athletes? live locative data to a social network and communicates back remote-crowd support through haptic and audible cheers. Our work takes an exploratory design approach to bring new insights into the design of real-time techno-mediated social support. The prototype was deployed during a 170-mile charity relay race across the UK with 13 participants, 261 on-line supporters, and gathered a total of 3,153 'cheers'. We report on the insights collected during the design and deployment process and identify three fundamental design considerations: the degree of spectator expression that the design affords, the context applicability, and the data flow within the social network.","

Prioritizing Flexibility and Intangibles: Medical Crowdfunding for Stigmatized Individuals,"HCI research on crowdfunding has primarily focused on creative or organizational endeavors. Yet a majority of crowdfunding campaigns are conducted by individuals in need, often for healthcare. To better understand and improve this common crowdfunding experience, especially for those that inhabit a vulnerable social status, we conducted 20 interviews with transmen crowdfunding for top-surgery. Design choices that optimize site flexibility (e.g. control of personal information; enable cross-site communication) and foreground intangibles, such as political values and emotional support, are priorities for individuals from a stigmatized community. Findings differed from previous crowdfunding research and contribute to limited research on transgender identities in HCI. Overall they provide unique insights into how design choices can facilitate marginalized identity management in highly public online spaces.","

Conversational Chat Circles: Being All Here Without Having to Hear It All,"Live streaming services are a growing form of social media. Most live streaming platforms allow viewers to communicate with each other and the broadcaster via a text chat. However, interaction in a text chat does not work well with too many users. Existing techniques to make text chat work with a larger number of participants often limit who can participate or how much users can participate. In this paper, we describe a new design for a text chat system that allows more people to participate without overwhelming users with too many messages. Our design strategically limits the number of messages a user sees based on the concept of neighborhoods, and emphasizes important messages through upvoting. We present a study comparing our system to a chat system similar to those found in commercial streaming services. Results of the study indicate that the Conversational Circle system is easier to understand and interact with, while supporting community among viewers and highlighting important content for the streamer.","Social Media technology can overwhelm users with too many messages, making it difficult to participate in text chats and limiting community engagement.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025621,Social Media,CHI,user experience
The Pokémon GO Experience: A Location-Based Augmented Reality Mobile Game Goes Mainstream,"Pokémon GO is a location-based augmented reality mobile game based on the Pokémon franchise. After the game was launched globally in July 2016, it quickly became the most successful mobile game in both popularity and revenue generation at the time, and the first location-based augmented reality game to reach a mainstream status. We explore the game experiences through a qualitative survey (n=1000) in Finland focusing on the positive and the negative aspects of Pokémon GO as told by the players. The positive experiences are related to movement, sociability, game mechanics, and brand while the negative experiences emerge from technical problems, unequal gaming opportunities, bad behavior of other players and non-players, and unpolished game design. Interestingly, the augmented reality features, safety issues or the free-to-play revenue model did not receive considerable feedback. The findings are useful for academics and industry practitioners for studying and designing location-based augmented reality game experiences.","Technical problems, unequal gaming opportunities, bad behavior of other players and non-players, and unpolished game design.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025871,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Us vs. Them: Understanding Artificial Intelligence Technophobia over the Google DeepMind Challenge Match,"Various forms of artificial intelligence (AI), such as Apple's Siri and Google Now, have permeated our everyday lives. However, the advent of such ""human-like"" technology has stirred both awe and a great deal of fear. Many consider it a woe to have an unimaginable future where human intelligence is exceeded by AI. This paper investigates how people perceive and understand AI with a case study of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, a Go match between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, in March 2016. This study explores the underlying and changing perspectives toward AI as users experienced this historic event. Interviews with 22 participants show that users tacitly refer to AlphaGo as an ""other"" as if it were comparable to a human, while dreading that it would come back to them as a potential existential threat. Our work illustrates a confrontational relationship between users and AI, and suggests the need to prepare for a new kind of user experience in this nascent socio- technological change.

Tell Me Where to Look: Investigating Ways for Assisting Focus in 360° Video,"360° videos give viewers a spherical view and immersive experience of surroundings. However, one challenge of watching 360° videos is continuously focusing and re-focusing intended targets. To address this challenge, we developed two Focus Assistance techniques: Auto Pilot (directly bringing viewers to the target), and Visual Guidance (indicating the direction of the target). We conducted an experiment to measure viewers' video-watching experience and discomfort using these techniques and obtained their qualitative feedback. We showed that: 1) Focus Assistance improved ease of focus. 2) Focus Assistance techniques have specificity to video content. 3) Participants' preference of and experience with Focus Assistance depended not only on individual difference but also on their goal of watching the video. 4) Factors such as view-moving-distance, salience of the intended target and guidance, and language comprehension affected participants' video-watching experience. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for better 360° video focus assistance.","

Looking Coordinated: Bidirectional Gaze Mechanisms for Collaborative Interaction with Virtual Characters,"Successful collaboration relies on the coordination and alignment of communicative cues. In this paper, we present mechanisms of bidirectional gaze - the coordinated production and detection of gaze cues - by which a virtual character can coordinate its gaze cues with those of its human user. We implement these mechanisms in a hybrid stochastic/heuristic model synthesized from data collected in human-human interactions. In three lab studies wherein a virtual character instructs participants in a sandwich-making task, we demonstrate how bidirectional gaze can lead to positive outcomes in error rate, completion time, and the agent's ability to produce quick, effective nonverbal references. The first study involved an on-screen agent and the participant wearing eye-tracking glasses. The second study demonstrates that these positive outcomes can be achieved using head-pose estimation in place of full eye tracking. The third study demonstrates that these effects also transfer into virtual-reality interactions.","

The article highlights the potential for virtual characters to manipulate human users through coordinated gaze cues, leading to increased error rates and decreased completion times in tasks. This could have negative impacts on society, such as decreased productivity and increased reliance on technology. Additionally, the use of head-pose estimation instead of full eye tracking raises privacy concerns, as it can be used to track users' movements and activities without their knowledge or consent.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026033,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Supporting Community Health Workers in India through Voice- and Web-Based Feedback,"Our research aims to support community health workers (CHWs) in low-resource settings by providing them with personalized information regarding their work. This information is delivered through a combination of voice- and web-based feedback that is derived from data already collected by CHWs. We describe the in situ participatory design approach used to create usable and appropriate feedback for low-literate CHWs and present usage data from a 12-month study with 71 CHWs in India. We show how the system supported and motivated CHWs, and how they used both the web- and voice-based systems, and each of the visualizations, for different reasons. We also show that the comparative feedback provided by the system introduced elements of competition that discouraged some CHWs while motivating others. Taken together, our findings suggest that providing personalized voice- and web-based feedback could be an effective way to support and motivate CHWs in low-resource settings.","

"Centralized, Parallel, and Distributed Information Processing during Collective Sensemaking","Widespread rumoring can hinder attempts to make sense of what is going on during disaster scenarios. Understanding how and why rumors spread in these contexts could assist in the design of systems that facilitate timely and accurate sensemaking. We address a basic question in this line: To what extent does rumor evolution occur (1) through reliance on a centralized information source, (2) in parallel information silos, or (3) through a web of complex informational interactions? We develop a conceptual model and associated analysis algorithms that allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. We analyze a case of rumoring on Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. We find that rumor spreading was predominantly a parallel process in this case, which is consistent with a hypothesis that information silos may underlie the persistence of false rumors. Special attention towards detecting and resolving parallel information threads during collective sensemaking may hence be warranted.","Rumors spread quickly and persist through parallel information silos, hindering accurate sensemaking during disaster scenarios.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026012,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
A Multifaceted Study on Eye Contact based Speaker Identification in Three-party Conversations,"To precisely understand human gaze behaviors in three-party conversations, this work is dedicated to look into whether the speaker can be reliably identified from the interlocutors in a three-party conversation on the basis of the interactive behaviors of eye contact, where speech signals are not provided. Derived from a pre-recorded, multimodal, and three-party conversational behavior dataset, a statistical framework is pro- posed to determine who is the speaker from the interactive behaviors of eye contact. Additionally, with the aid of virtual human technologies, a user study is conducted to study whether subjects are capable of distinguishing the speaker from the listeners according to the gaze behaviors of the interlocutors alone. Our results show that eye contact provides a reliable cue for the identification of the speaker in three-party conversations.","

The study's findings suggest that eye contact can be used to identify the speaker in a three-party conversation, even when speech signals are not available. This could potentially lead to a loss of privacy, as individuals' eye contact behaviors could be used to track their interactions and identify their role in a conversation without their consent. Additionally, the use of virtual human technologies to study this phenomenon raises concerns about the potential for technology to manipulate or deceive individuals, particularly in situations where they are not aware of being observed.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025644,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Supporting Making Fixations and the Effect on Gaze Gesture Performance,"Gaze gestures are deliberate patterns of eye movements that can be used to invoke commands. These are less reliant on accurate measurement and calibration than other gaze-based interaction techniques. These may be used with wearable displays fitted with eye tracking capability, or as part of an assistive technology. The visual stimuli in the information on the display that can act as fixation targets may or may not be sparse and will vary over time. The paper describes an experiment to investigate how the amount of information provided on a display to assist making fixations affects gaze gesture performance. The impact of providing visualization guides and small fixation targets on the time to complete gestures and error rates is presented. The number and durations of fixations made during gesture completion is used to explain differences in performance as a result of practice and direction of eye movement.","

Fingertip Tactile Devices for Virtual Object Manipulation and Exploration,"One of the main barriers to immersivity during object manipulation in virtual reality is the lack of realistic haptic feedback. Our goal is to convey compelling interactions with virtual objects, such as grasping, squeezing, pressing, lifting, and stroking, without requiring a bulky, world-grounded kinesthetic feedback device (traditional haptics) or the use of predetermined passive objects (haptic retargeting). To achieve this, we use a pair of finger-mounted haptic feedback devices that deform the skin on the fingertips to convey cutaneous force information from object manipulation. We show that users can perceive differences in virtual object weight and that they apply increasing grasp forces when lifting virtual objects as rendered mass is increased. Moreover, we show how naive users perceive changes of a virtual object's physical properties when we use skin deformation to render objects with varying mass, friction, and stiffness. These studies demonstrate that fingertip skin deformation devices can provide a compelling haptic experience appropriate for virtual reality scenarios involving object manipulation.","Users may become less aware of the physical properties of real objects and their interactions with them, as they become more accustomed to the virtual simulations.

Providing Online Crisis Information: An Analysis of Official Sources during the 2014 Carlton Complex Wildfire,"Using the 2014 Carlton Complex Wildfire as a case study, we examine who contributes official information online during a crisis event, and the timeliness and relevance of the information provided. We identify and describe the communication behaviors of four types of official information sources (Event Based Resources, Local Responders, Local News Media, and Cooperating Agencies), and collect message data from each source's website, public Facebook page, and/or Twitter account. The data show that the Local News Media provided the highest quantity of relevant information and the timeliest information. Event Based Resources shared the highest percentage of relevant information, however, it was often unclear who managed these resources and the credibility of the information. Based on these findings, we offer suggestions for how providers of official crisis information might better manage their online communications and ways that the public can find more timely and relevant online crisis information from official sources.","

The study found that during a crisis event, the public may not be able to find timely and relevant information from official sources online.

"""Algorithms ruin everything"": #RIPTwitter, Folk Theories, and Resistance to Algorithmic Change in Social Media","As algorithmically-driven content curation has become an increasingly common feature of social media platforms, user resistance to algorithmic change has become more frequent and visible. These incidents of user backlash point to larger issues such as inaccurate understandings of how algorithmic systems work as well as mismatches between designer and user intent. Using a content analysis of 102,827 tweets from #RIPTwitter, a recent hashtag-based backlash to rumors about introducing algorithmic curation to Twitter's timeline, this study addresses the nature of user resistance in the form of the complaints being expressed, folk theories of the algorithmic system espoused by users, and how these folk theories potentially frame user reactions. We find that resistance to algorithmic change largely revolves around expectation violation, with folk theories acting as frames for reactions such that more detailed folk theories are expressed through more specific reactions to algorithmic change.","Algorithmic curation of social media content can lead to user resistance and backlash, as users may feel that the algorithmic system does not align with their expectations and may not fully understand how it works.

The Bag of Communities: Identifying Abusive Behavior Online with Preexisting Internet Data,"Since its earliest days, harassment and abuse have plagued the Internet. Recent research has focused on in-domain methods to detect abusive content and faces several challenges, most notably the need to obtain large training corpora. In this paper, we introduce a novel computational approach to address this problem called Bag of Communities (BoC)---a technique that leverages large-scale, preexisting data from other Internet communities. We then apply BoC toward identifying abusive behavior within a major Internet community. Specifically, we compute a post's similarity to 9 other communities from 4chan, Reddit, Voat and MetaFilter. We show that a BoC model can be used on communities ""off the shelf"" with roughly 75% accuracy---no training examples are needed from the target community. A dynamic BoC model achieves 91.18% accuracy after seeing 100,000 human-moderated posts, and uniformly outperforms in-domain methods. Using this conceptual and empirical work, we argue that the BoC approach may allow communities to deal with a range of common problems, like abusive behavior, faster and with fewer engineering resources.","Abusive behavior and harassment on the internet, which can affect individuals and communities, and can be difficult to detect and address.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026018,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Multimodal Classification of Moderated Online Pro-Eating Disorder Content,"Social media sites are challenged by both the scale and variety of deviant behavior online. While algorithms can detect spam and obscenity, behaviors that break community guidelines on some sites are difficult because they have multimodal subtleties (images and/or text). Identifying these posts is often regulated to a few moderators. In this paper, we develop a deep learning classifier that jointly models textual and visual characteristics of pro-eating disorder content that violates community guidelines. Using a million Tumblr photo posts, our classifier discovers deviant content efficiently while also maintaining high recall (85%). Our approach uses human sensitivity throughout to guide the creation, curation, and understanding of this approach to challenging, deviant content. We discuss how automation might impact community moderation, and the ethical and social obligations of this area.","Social media platforms struggle to detect deviant behavior that violates community guidelines, such as pro-eating disorder content, due to the complexity and nuances of the content.

Modeling Cumulative Arm Fatigue in Mid-Air Interaction based on Perceived Exertion and Kinetics of Arm Motion,"Quantifying cumulative arm muscle fatigue is a critical factor in understanding, evaluating, and optimizing user experience during prolonged mid-air interaction. A reasonably accurate estimation of fatigue requires an estimate of an individual's strength. However, there is no easy-to-access method to measure individual strength to accommodate inter-individual differences. Furthermore, fatigue is influenced by both psychological and physiological factors, but no current HCI model provides good estimates of cumulative subjective fatigue. We present a new, simple method to estimate the maximum shoulder torque through a mid-air pointing task, which agrees with direct strength measurements. We then introduce a cumulative fatigue model informed by subjective and biomechanical measures. We evaluate the performance of the model in estimating cumulative subjective fatigue in mid-air interaction by performing multiple cross-validations and a comparison with an existing fatigue metric. Finally, we discuss the potential of our approach for real-time evaluation of subjective fatigue as well as future challenges.","Prolonged use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can lead to muscle fatigue, particularly in the arms and shoulders, which can negatively impact user experience and potentially cause long-term health problems.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025523,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Class Confessions: Restorative Properties in Online Experiences of Socioeconomic Stigma,"In this paper, we examine stigma related to class identity online through an empirical examination of Elite University Class Confessions (EUCC). EUCC is an online space that includes a Facebook page and a surrounding sociotechnical ecosystem. It is a community of, for, and about low-income and first generation students at an elite university. By bringing in a community that learns and engages with users' socioeconomic struggles, EUCC engenders unique restorative properties for students experiencing class stigma. EUCC's restorative properties foster new ways of understanding one's stigmatized identity through meaning- making interactions in a networked sociotechnical system.

A New Chatbot for Customer Service on Social Media,"Users are rapidly turning to social media to request and receive customer service; however, a majority of these requests were not addressed timely or even not addressed at all. To overcome the problem, we create a new conversational system to automatically generate responses for users requests on social media. Our system is integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and is trained by nearly 1M Twitter conversations between users and agents from over 60 brands. The evaluation reveals that over 40% of the requests are emotional, and the system is about as good as human agents in showing empathy to help users cope with emotional situations. Results also show our system outperforms information retrieval system based on both human judgments and an automatic evaluation metric.","Social Media platforms are not effectively addressing customer service requests in a timely manner, leading to frustration and negative emotions for users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025496,Social Media,CHI,user experience
BreakSense: Combining Physiological and Location Sensing to Promote Mobility during Work-Breaks,"Work breaks can play an important role in the mental and physical well-being of workers and contribute positively to productivity. In this paper we explore the use of activity-, physiological-, and indoor-location sensing to promote mobility during work-breaks. While the popularity of devices and applications to promote physical activity is growing, prior research highlights important constraints when designing for the workplace. With these constraints in mind, we developed BreakSense, a mobile application that uses a Bluetooth beacon infrastructure, a smartphone and a smartwatch to encourage mobility during breaks with a game-like design. We discuss constraints imposed by design for work and the workplace, and highlight challenges associated with the use of noisy sensors and methods to overcome them. We then describe a short deployment of BreakSense within our lab that examined bound vs. unbound augmented breaks and how they affect users' sense of completion and readiness to work.","Over-reliance on technology and decreased physical activity.

Insight: The article highlights the importance of work breaks for mental and physical well-being, but also notes that technology can be a double-edged sword. While devices and applications can promote physical activity, they can also lead to decreased physical activity if over-relied upon. The article suggests that game-like designs, such as the BreakSense application, can encourage mobility during breaks, but also notes that there are challenges associated with the use of noisy sensors and methods to overcome them. This implies that technology is not a panacea and that a balance between technology and physical activity is necessary for optimal well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026021,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Supporting the Use of User Generated Content in Journalistic Practice,"Social media and user-generated content (UGC) are increasingly important features of journalistic work in a number of different ways. However, their use presents major challenges, not least because information posted on social media is not always reliable and therefore its veracity needs to be checked before it can be considered as fit for use in the reporting of news. We report on the results of a series of in-depth ethnographic studies of journalist work practices undertaken as part of the requirements gathering for a prototype of a social media verification 'dashboard' and its subsequent evaluation. We conclude with some reflections upon the broader implications of our findings for the design of tools to support journalistic work.",Unreliable information spreading through social media can be harmful to journalism and society as a whole.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025892,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
WireDraw: 3D Wire Sculpturing Guided with Mixed Reality,"The availability of commodity 3D extruder pen allows direct drawing of 3D wire sculptures for novice users, enabling many novel applications such as intuitive spatial intelligence development for school students. However, the lack of spatial and structural cues among individual pen strokes makes the 3D drawing process challenging, which often leads to highly distorted and even incomplete wire sculptures. We present a mixed reality system, called `WireDraw', to immersively guide the 3D drawing for easy wire sculpturing. The system design is based on novel 3D drawing principles and the subsequent optimization, making the stroke sequence of the wire model drawable and easy to draw. On-the-fly edits on unsatisfactory strokes are also allowed for creative design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by testing on a variety of wire models and a user study. The results show that the visual guidance provided by our system is extremely helpful for drawing high-quality wire sculptures.",Distorted and incomplete wire sculptures due to lack of spatial and structural cues.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025792,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
HapticHead: A Spherical Vibrotactile Grid around the Head for 3D Guidance in Virtual and Augmented Reality,"Current virtual and augmented reality head-mounted displays usually include no or only a single vibration motor for haptic feedback and do not use it for guidance. We present HapticHead, a system utilizing multiple vibrotactile actuators distributed in three concentric ellipses around the head for intuitive haptic guidance through moving tactile cues. We conducted three experiments, which indicate that HapticHead vibrotactile feedback is both faster (2.6 s vs. 6.9 s) and more precise (96.4% vs. 54.2% success rate) than spatial audio (generic head-related transfer function) for finding visible virtual objects in 3D space around the user. The baseline of visual feedback is as expected more precise (99.7% success rate) and faster (1.3 s) in comparison, but there are many applications in which visual feedback is not desirable or available due to lighting conditions, visual overload, or visual impairments. Mean final precision with HapticHead feedback on invisible targets is 2.3° compared to 0.8° with visual feedback. We successfully navigated blindfolded users to real household items at different heights using HapticHead vibrotactile feedback independently of a head-mounted display.","

The use of vibrotactile feedback in virtual and augmented reality head-mounted displays can lead to a decrease in visual precision and speed, as users may rely more heavily on haptic feedback and neglect visual cues. This could result in a decrease in overall performance and accuracy, especially in tasks that require both visual and haptic information. Additionally, the use of vibrotactile feedback may not be suitable for all applications, such as those that require visual attention or where visual overload is a concern.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025684,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
FDVT: Data Valuation Tool for Facebook Users,"The OECD, the European Union and other public and private initiatives are claiming for the necessity of tools that create awareness among Internet users about the monetary value associated to the commercial exploitation of their online personal information. This paper presents the first tool addressing this challenge, the Facebook Data Valuation Tool (FDVT). The FDVT provides Facebook users with a personalized and real-time estimation of the revenue they generate for Facebook. Relying on the FDVT, we are able to shed light into several relevant HCI research questions that require a data valuation tool in place. The obtained results reveal that (i) there exists a deep lack of awareness among Internet users regarding the monetary value of personal information, (ii) data valuation tools such as the FDVT are useful means to reduce such knowledge gap, (iii) 1/3 of the users testing the FDVT show a substantial engagement with the tool.","Lack of awareness among internet users regarding the monetary value of their personal information online, leading to uninformed consent and potential exploitation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025903,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Characterizing Social Insider Attacks on Facebook,"Facebook accounts are secured against unauthorized access through passwords and device-level security. Those defenses, however, may not be sufficient to prevent social insider attacks, where attackers know their victims, and gain access to a victim's account by interacting directly with their device. To characterize these attacks, we ran two MTurk studies. In the first (n = 1,308), using the list experiment method, we estimated that 24% of participants had perpetrated social insider attacks and that 21% had been victims (and knew about it). In the second study (n = 45), participants wrote stories detailing personal experiences with such attacks. Using thematic analysis, we typified attacks around five motivations (fun, curiosity, jealousy, animosity, and utility), and explored dimensions associated with each type. Our combined findings indicate that social insider attacks are common, often have serious emotional consequences, and have no simple mitigation.","Social Media accounts are vulnerable to social insider attacks, where attackers gain access to a victim's account by interacting directly with their device, resulting in serious emotional consequences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025901,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Photo Privacy Conflicts in Social Media: A Large-scale Empirical Study,"Items in social media such as photos may be co-owned by multiple users, i.e., the sharing decisions of the ones who upload them have the potential to harm the privacy of the others. Previous works uncovered coping strategies by co-owners to manage their privacy, but mainly focused on general practices and experiences. We establish an empirical base for the prevalence, context and severity of privacy conflicts over co-owned photos. To this aim, a parallel survey of pre-screened 496 uploaders and 537 co-owners collected occurrences and type of conflicts over co-owned photos, and any actions taken towards resolving them. We uncover nuances and complexities not known before, including co-ownership types, and divergences in the assessment of photo audiences. We also find that an all-or-nothing approach seems to dominate conflict resolution, even when parties actually interact and talk about the conflict. Finally, we derive key insights for designing systems to mitigate these divergences and facilitate consensus.","Privacy conflicts over co-owned photos on social media, leading to potential harm to the privacy of individuals involved.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025668,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Was my message read?: Privacy and Signaling on Facebook Messenger,"Major online messaging services such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp are starting to provide users with real-time information about when people read their messages, while useful, the feature has the potential to negatively impact privacy as well as cause concern over access to self. We report on two surveys using Mechanical Turk which looked at senders' (N=402} use of and reactions to the `message seen' feature, and recipients' (N=316) privacy and signaling behaviors in the face of such visibility. Our findings indicate that senders experience a range of emotions when their message is not read, or is read but not answered immediately. Recipients also engage in various signaling behaviors in the face of visibility by both replying or not replying immediately.",Privacy concerns and pressure to respond immediately.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025925,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Interactive Visual Calibration of Volumetric Head-Tracked 3D Displays,"Head-tracked 3D displays can provide a compelling 3D effect, but even small inaccuracies in the calibration of the participant's viewpoint to the display can disrupt the 3D illusion. We propose a novel interactive procedure for a participant to easily and accurately calibrate a head-tracked display by visually aligning patterns across a multi-screen display. Head-tracker measurements are then calibrated to these known viewpoints. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of different visual patterns and different display shapes. We found that the easiest to align shape was the spherical display and the best calibration pattern was the combination of circles and lines. We performed a quantitative camera-based calibration of a cubic display and found visual calibration outperformed manual tuning and generated viewpoint calibrations accurate to within a degree. Our work removes the usual, burdensome step of manual calibration when using head-tracked displays and paves the way for wider adoption of this inexpensive and effective 3D display technology.","Inaccurate calibration of head-tracked displays can disrupt the 3D illusion, leading to a poor user experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025685,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Changing the Appearance of Real-World Objects By Modifying Their Surroundings,"We present an approach to alter the perceived appearance of physical objects by controlling their surrounding space. Many real-world objects cannot easily be equipped with displays or actuators in order to change their shape. While common approaches such as projection mapping enable changing the appearance of objects without modifying them, certain surface properties (e.g. highly reflective or transparent surfaces) can make employing these techniques difficult. In this work, we present a conceptual design exploration on how the appearance of an object can be changed by solely altering the space around it, rather than the object itself. In a proof-of-concept implementation, we place objects onto a tabletop display and track them together with users to display perspective-corrected 3D graphics for augmentation. This enables controlling properties such as the perceived size, color, or shape of objects. We characterize the design space of our approach and demonstrate potential applications. For example, we change the contour of a wallet to notify users when their bank account is debited. We envision our approach to gain in importance with increasing ubiquity of display surfaces.","

The technology can be used to manipulate people's perception of physical objects, potentially leading to false or misleading information. For example, a wallet's appearance could be altered to make it seem like it contains more money than it actually does, or a product's size could be made to appear larger or smaller than it really is. This could lead to confusion, misunderstandings, or even fraud. Additionally, the ability to manipulate the appearance of objects without actually changing them could further blur the lines between reality and virtual reality, potentially leading to a loss of trust in one's own perceptions and experiences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025795,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
HeadPhones: Ad Hoc Mobile Multi-Display Environments through Head Tracking,"We present HeadPhones (Headtracking + smartPhones), a novel approach for the spatial registration of multiple mobile devices into an ad hoc multi-display environment. We propose to employ the user's head as external reference frame for the registration of multiple mobile devices into a common coordinate system. Our approach allows for dynamic repositioning of devices during runtime without the need for external infrastructure such as separate cameras or fiducials. Specifically, our only requirements are local network connections and mobile devices with built-in front facing cameras. This way, HeadPhones enables spatially-aware multi-display applications in mobile contexts. A user study and accuracy evaluation indicate the feasibility of our approach.","

The use of HeadPhones technology could lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and social skills, as people become more reliant on technology and less inclined to engage with others in person. This could have negative effects on mental health and well-being, as well as the ability to form meaningful connections with others. Additionally, the constant use of cameras and sensors to track the user's head movements could raise privacy concerns, as users may feel like they are being constantly monitored.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025533,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
ShareVR: Enabling Co-Located Experiences for Virtual Reality between HMD and Non-HMD Users,"Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMD) allow for a highly immersive experience and are currently becoming part of the living room entertainment. Current VR systems focus mainly on increasing the immersion and enjoyment for the user wearing the HMD (HMD user), resulting in all the bystanders (Non-HMD users) being excluded from the experience. We propose ShareVR, a proof-of-concept prototype using floor projection and mobile displays in combination with positional tracking to visualize the virtual world for the Non-HMD user, enabling them to interact with the HMD user and become part of the VR experience. We designed and implemented ShareVR based on the insights of an initial online survey (n=48) with early adopters of VR HMDs. We ran a user study (n=16) comparing ShareVRto a baseline condition showing how the interaction using ShareVR led to an increase of enjoyment, presence and social interaction. In a last step we implemented several experiences for ShareVR, exploring its design space and giving insights for designers of co-located asymmetric VR experiences.","Exclusion of non-HMD users from the VR experience, leading to a lack of social interaction and enjoyment for those not wearing the HMD.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025683,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
CarVR: Enabling In-Car Virtual Reality Entertainment,"Mobile virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) allow users to experience highly immersive entertainment whilst being in a mobile scenario. Long commute times make casual gaming in public transports and cars a common occupation. However, VR HMDs can currently not be used in moving vehicles since the car's rotation affects the HMD's sensors and simulator sickness occurs when the visual and vestibular system are stimulated with incongruent information. We present CarVR, a solution to enable VR in moving vehicles by subtracting the car's rotation and mapping vehicular movements with the visual information. This allows the user to actually feel correct kinesthetic forces during the VR experience. In a user study (n = 21), we compared CarVR inside a moving vehicle with the baseline of using VR without vehicle movements. We show that the perceived kinesthetic forces caused by CarVR increase enjoyment and immersion significantly while simulator sickness is reduced compared to a stationary VR experience. Finally, we explore the design space of in-car VR entertainment applications using real kinesthetic forces and derive design considerations for practitioners.","Simulator sickness, which occurs when the visual and vestibular system are stimulated with incongruent information, can happen when using VR in moving vehicles.

Effects of Sharing Physiological States of Players in a Collaborative Virtual Reality Gameplay,"Interfaces for collaborative tasks, such as multiplayer games can enable more effective and enjoyable collaboration. However, in these systems, the emotional states of the users are often not communicated properly due to their remoteness from one another. In this paper, we investigate the effects of showing emotional states of one collaborator to the other during an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) gameplay experience. We created two collaborative immersive VR games that display the real-time heart-rate of one player to the other. The two different games elicited different emotions, one joyous and the other scary. We tested the effects of visualizing heart-rate feedback in comparison with conditions where such a feedback was absent. The games had significant main effects on the overall emotional experience.","

VRRRRoom: Virtual Reality for Radiologists in the Reading Room,"Reading room conditions such as illumination, ambient light, human factors and display luminance, play an important role on how radiologists analyze and interpret images. Indeed, serious diagnostic errors can appear when observing images through everyday monitors. Typically, these occur whenever professionals are ill-positioned with respect to the display or visualize images under improper light and luminance conditions. In this work, we show that virtual reality can assist radiodiagnostics by considerably diminishing or cancel out the effects of unsuitable ambient conditions. Our approach combines immersive head-mounted displays with interactive surfaces to support professional radiologists in analyzing medical images and formulating diagnostics. We evaluated our prototype with two senior medical doctors and four seasoned radiology fellows. Results indicate that our approach constitutes a viable, flexible, portable and cost-efficient option to traditional radiology reading rooms.","

The use of virtual reality technology in radiology can lead to a decrease in the accuracy of diagnoses due to the elimination of important visual cues that are present in traditional reading rooms, such as the ability to see the patient's body language and facial expressions. Additionally, the use of virtual reality can also lead to a decrease in the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with other medical professionals.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025566,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Handsfree Omnidirectional VR Navigation using Head Tilt,"Navigating mobile virtual reality (VR) is a challenge due to limited input options and/or a requirement for handsfree interaction. Walking-in-place (WIP) is considered to offer a higher presence than controller input but only allows unidirectional navigation in the direction of the user's gaze--which impedes navigation efficiency. Leaning input enables omnidirectional navigation but currently relies on bulky controllers, which aren't feasible in mobile VR contexts. This note evaluates the use of head-tilt - implemented using inertial sensing - to allow for handsfree omnidirectional VR navigation on mobile VR platforms. A user study with 24 subjects compared three input methods using an obstacle avoidance navigation task: (1) head-tilt alone (TILT) (2) a hybrid method (WIP-TILT) that uses head tilting for direction and WIP to control speed; and (3) traditional controller input. TILT was significantly faster than WIP-TILT and joystick input, while WIP-TILT and TILT offered the highest presence. There was no difference in cybersickness between input methods.","

The use of head-tilt for omnidirectional navigation in mobile VR can lead to higher presence and efficiency, but may also cause cybersickness, which can negatively impact the user's experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025521,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
The Role of Explanations in Casual Observational Learning about Nutrition,"The ubiquity of internet-based nutrition information sharing indicates an opportunity to use social computing platforms to promote nutrition literacy and healthy nutritional choices. We conducted a series of experiments with unpaid volunteers using an online Nutrition Knowledge Test. The test asked participants to examine pairs of photographed meals and identify meals higher in a specific macronutrient (e.g., carbohydrate). After each answer, participants received no feedback on the accuracy of their answers, viewed proportions of peers choosing each response, received correctness feedback from an expert dietitian with or without expert-generated explanations, or received correctness feedback with crowd-generated explanations. The results showed that neither viewing peer responses nor correctness feedback alone improved learning. However, correctness feedback with explanations (i.e., modeling) led to significant learning gains, with no significant difference between explanations generated by experts or peers. This suggests the importance of explanations in social computing-based casual learning about nutrition and the potential for scaling this approach via crowdsourcing.","Social media can lead to the spread of misinformation and incorrect knowledge, especially in the field of nutrition, as people may rely on unreliable sources and not receive accurate information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025874,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Understanding Low Vision People's Visual Perception on Commercial Augmented Reality Glasses,"People with low vision have a visual impairment that affects their ability to perform daily activities. Unlike blind people, low vision people have functional vision and can potentially benefit from smart glasses that provide dynamic, always-available visual information. We sought to determine what low vision people could see on mainstream commercial augmented reality (AR) glasses, despite their visual limitations and the device's constraints. We conducted a study with 20 low vision participants and 18 sighted controls, asking them to identify virtual shapes and text in different sizes, colors, and thicknesses. We also evaluated their ability to see the virtual elements while walking. We found that low vision participants were able to identify basic shapes and read short phrases on the glasses while sitting and walking. Identifying virtual elements had a similar effect on low vision and sighted people's walking speed, slowing it down slightly. Our study yielded preliminary evidence that mainstream AR glasses can be powerful accessibility tools. We derive guidelines for presenting visual output for low vision people and discuss opportunities for accessibility applications on this platform.","

The study found that while low vision participants were able to identify virtual elements on AR glasses, it slowed down their walking speed, similarly to sighted people. This suggests that the use of AR technology can have a negative impact on mobility and potentially lead to accidents or injuries, especially for people with visual impairments.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025949,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
MoveMeant: Anonymously Building Community Through Shared Location Histories,"Awareness of and connections to a local community are important for building social capital, sharing resources, and providing physical support, but have been elusive to create in dense urban environments. We describe the design and implementation of MoveMeant, a system aimed to increase local community awareness through shared location traces. MoveMeant securely uses anonymized location data generated automatically by mobile devices to display aggregate, community-level location data. We report findings from interviews with residents in the Bronx, New York City who participated in a deployment of MoveMeant over a 6-week period. Our findings show that people use the anonymous information to make judgments about the people and places in their community, while opting to reveal their identity for third places where there is an opportunity to connect socially.","People are using anonymized location data to make judgments about others in their community, potentially leading to negative stereotypes and discrimination.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025653,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
EnseWing: Creating an Instrumental Ensemble Playing Experience for Children with Limited Music Training,"While instrumental ensemble playing can benefit children's music education and collaboration skill development, it requires extensive training on music and instruments, which many school children lack.

Community Commerce: Facilitating Trust in Mom-to-Mom Sale Groups on Facebook,"Consumers are turning to Facebook Groups to buy and sell with strangers in their local communities. This trend is counter-intuitive given Facebook's lack of conventional e-commerce features, such as sophisticated search engines and reputation systems. We interviewed 18 members of two Mom-to-Mom Facebook sale groups. Despite a lack of commerce tools, members perceived sale groups as an easy-to-use way to quickly and conveniently buy and sell. Most important to members was that the groups felt safe and trustworthy. Drawing on these insights, we contribute a novel framing, community commerce, which explains the trust mechanisms that enable transactions between strangers in some groups. Community commerce fosters trust through (a) exclusive membership to a closed group, (b) regulation and sanctioning of behavior at the admin, member, and group level, and (c) a shared group identity or perceived similarity (though, surprisingly, not through social bonding). We discuss how community commerce affords unique and sometimes superior trust assurances and propose design implications for platforms hoping to foster trust between members who buy, sell, or share amongst themselves.","Social media platforms like Facebook Groups can create a false sense of trust and safety among users, leading to increased risk of fraud and other negative transactions between strangers. Exclusive membership and regulation by admins and members can create a false sense of security, while a shared group identity can lead to a lack of critical evaluation of potential risks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025550,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
The Object Inside: Assessing 3D Examination with a Spherical Handheld Perspective-Corrected Display,"Handheld Perspective Corrected Displays (HPCDs) can create the feeling of holding a virtual 3D object. They offer a direct interaction that is isomorphic to the manipulation of physical objects. This illusion depends on the ability to provide a natural visuomotor coupling. High performances systems are thus required to evaluate the fundamental merits of HPCDs. We built a spherical HPCD using external projection. The system offers a lightweight wireless seamless display with head-coupled stereo, robust tracking, and low latency. We compared users' performances with this HPCD and two other interactions that used a fixed planar display and either a touchpad or the spherical display as an indirect input. The task involved the inspection of complex virtual 3D puzzles. Physical puzzles were also tested as references. Contrary to expectations, all virtual interactions were found to be more efficient than a more ""natural"" physical puzzle. The HPCD yielded lower performances than the touchpad. This study indicates that the object examination task did not benefit from the accurate and precise rotations offered by the HPCD, but benefited from the high C/D gain of the touchpad.","

The study found that users were less efficient when using a virtual 3D object with a natural visuomotor coupling, compared to a physical puzzle or a touchpad input. This suggests that relying too heavily on virtual reality technology can lead to decreased performance and efficiency, especially in tasks that require precise manipulation and examination.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025806,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
The Geometry of Storytelling: Theatrical Use of Space for 360-degree Videos and Virtual Reality,"360-degree filming and head-mounted displays (HMDs) give recorded media a new sense of space. Theatre practitioners' expertise in manipulating spatial interactions has much to contribute to immersive recorded content. Four theatre directors led teams of three actors to stage the same scene for both immersive theatre and for 360-degree filming. Each team was recorded performing the scene at least six times, three in each condition, to extract actors' coordinates. This study establishes how to quantify theatre practitioners' use of spatial interactions and examines the spatial adaptations made when transferring these relationships to 360-degree filming. Staging for a 360-degree camera compared to staging for an audience member had shorter distances from the camera and between performers, along with fewer instances of the camera being in the middle of the action. Across all groups, interpersonal distance between characters and between the audience/camera dropped at the end of the scene when the characters come together as a team, suggesting that elements of Proxemics may be applicable to narrative performance.","

The study found that when transferring theatrical performances to 360-degree filming, the staging and spatial interactions between actors were altered, resulting in a loss of intimacy and connection between actors and audience. The use of 360-degree filming and head-mounted displays can lead to a decrease in interpersonal distance between characters and between the audience and camera, potentially detracting from the emotional impact of the performance.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025581,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Tap, Dwell or Gesture?: Exploring Head-Based Text Entry Techniques for HMDs","Despite the increasing popularity of head mounted displays (HMDs), development of efficient text entry methods on these devices has remained under explored. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of head-based text entry for HMDs, by which, the user controls a pointer on a virtual keyboard using head rotation. Specifically, we investigate three techniques: TapType, DwellType, and GestureType. Users of TapType select a letter by pointing to it and tapping a button. Users of DwellType select a letter by pointing to it and dwelling over it for a period of time. Users of GestureType perform word-level input using a gesture typing style. Two lab studies were conducted. In the first study, users typed 10.59 WPM, 15.58 WPM, and 19.04 WPM with DwellType, TapType, and GestureType, respectively. Users subjectively felt that all three of the techniques were easy to learn and considered the induced fatigue to be acceptable. In the second study, we further investigated GestureType. We improved its gesture-word recognition algorithm by incorporating the head movement pattern obtained from the first study. This resulted in users reaching 24.73 WPM after 60 minutes of training. Based on these results, we argue that head-based text entry is feasible and practical on HMDs, and deserves more attention.","

* Users may experience fatigue and discomfort from prolonged use of head-mounted displays (HMDs) for text entry.
* The techniques developed for head-based text entry may not be as efficient or accurate as traditional methods, potentially leading to frustration and errors.
* The use of head movements for text entry may be perceived as awkward or unnatural, potentially leading to social acceptability issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025964,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Watching 360° Videos Together,"360° videos are made using omnidirectional cameras that capture a sphere around the camera. Viewers get an immersive experience by freely changing their field of view around the sphere. The problem is that current interfaces are designed for a single user, and we do not know what challenges groups of people will have when viewing these videos together. We report on the findings of a study where 16 pairs of participants watched 360° videos together in a ""guided tour"" scenario. Our findings indicate that while participants enjoyed the ability to view the scene independently, this caused challenges establishing joint references, leading to breakdowns in conversation.

Revisiting The American Voter on Twitter,"The American Voter - a seminal work in political science - uncovered the multifaceted nature of voting behavior which has been corroborated in electoral research for decades since. In this paper, we leverage The American Voter as an analysis framework in the realm of computational political science, employing the factors of party, personality, and policy to structure the analysis of public discourse on online social media during the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries. Our analysis of 50 million tweets reveals the continuing importance of these three factors; our understanding is also enriched by the application of sentiment analysis techniques. The overwhelmingly negative sentiment of conversations surrounding 10 major presidential candidates reveals more ""crosstalk"" from Democratic leaning users towards Republican candidates, and less vice-versa. We uncover the lack of moderation as the most discussed personality dimension during this campaign season, as the political field becomes more extreme - Clinton and Rubio are perceived as moderate, while Trump, Sanders, and Cruz are not. While the most discussed issues are foreign policy and immigration, Republicans tweet more about abortion than Democrats who tweet more about gay rights than Republicans. Finally, we illustrate the importance of multifaceted political discourse analysis by applying regression to quantify the impact of party, personality, and policy on national polls.","Social media can reinforce political polarization and extremism, as users primarily interact with those who share their views, leading to a lack of moderation and increased negativity towards opposing candidates.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025543,Social Media,CHI,politics
Managing Uncertainty: Using Social Media for Risk Assessment during a Public Health Crisis,"Recently, diseases like H1N1 influenza, Ebola, and Zika virus have created severe crises, requiring public resources and personal behavior adaptation. Crisis Informatics literature examines interconnections of people, organizations, and IT during crisis events. However, how people use technology to cope with disease crises (outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics) remains understudied. We investigate how individuals used social media in response to the outbreak of Zika, focusing on travel-related decisions. We found that extreme uncertainty and ambiguity characterized the Zika virus crisis. To cope, people turned to social media for information gathering and social learning geared towards personal risk assessment and modifying decisions when dealing with partial and conflicting information about Zika. In particular, individuals sought local information and used socially informed logical reasoning to deduce the risk at a specific locale. We conclude with implications for designing information systems to support individual risk assessment and decision-making when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity during public health crises.","

XDBrowser 2.0: Semi-Automatic Generation of Cross-Device Interfaces,"Several recent studies have highlighted the need to support parallel usage of multiple devices for cross-device use. Yet, most interfaces today are still designed for single-device use and require re-authoring to enable cross-device interaction. This paper presents two studies to inform the design of a new web browser with support for semi-automatic generation of cross-device interfaces. Based on the results of a recent study in which users manually customized web pages for cross-device use, our first study elicits from users how they might want to trigger popular cross-device patterns to transform single-device designs with relatively little effort. Our second study then examines how the emerging design patterns could be applied to the Alexa top 50 sites from 10 different genres. Based on these studies, we design semi-automatic techniques for page segmentation and distribution between multiple devices that can work on many existing web sites and require only minimal user input to switch between different cross-device designs. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to the Chrome web browser to make the techniques available for a wide range of desktop, mobile, and wearable devices, and successfully test them on popular web sites.","
The increasing reliance on voice assistants like Alexa may lead to a decrease in manual customization and creativity, as users rely on pre-programmed commands and automated processes to interact with technology.

Genie: Input Retargeting on the Web through Command Reverse Engineering,"Most web applications are designed as one-size-fits-all, despite considerable variation in people's expertise, physical abilities, and other factors that impact interaction. For example, some web applications require the use of a mouse, precluding use by many people with severe motor disabilities. Other applications require laborious manual input that a skilled developer could automate if the application were scriptable. This paper presents Genie, a system that automatically reverse engineers an abstract model of the underlying commands in a web application, then enables interaction with that functionality through alternative interfaces and other input modalities (e.g., speech, keyboard, or command line input). Genie comprises an abstract model of command properties, behaviors, and dependencies as well as algorithms that reverse engineer this model from an existing web application through static and dynamic program analysis. We evaluate Genie by developing several interfaces that automatically add support for speech, keyboard, and command line input to arbitrary web applications.","

"Mouse, Tactile, and Tangible Input for 3D Manipulation","We evaluate the performance and usability of mouse-based, touch-based, and tangible interaction for manipulating objects in a 3D virtual environment. This comparison is a step toward a better understanding of the limitations and benefits of these existing interaction techniques, with the ultimate goal of facilitating an easy transition between the different 3D data exploration environments. For this purpose we analyze participants' performance in 3D manipulation using a docking task. We measured completion times, docking accuracy, as well as subjective criteria such as fatigue, workload, and preference. Our results show that the three input modalities provide similar levels of precision but require different completion times. We also discuss our qualitative observations as well as people's preferences and put our findings into context of the application domain of 3D data analysis environments.","

The study found that users experienced fatigue and increased workload when using certain interaction techniques, such as touch-based and tangible interaction, to manipulate objects in a 3D virtual environment.

MagicFace: Stepping into Character through an Augmented Reality Mirror,"Augmented Reality (AR) is coming of age and appearing in various smartphone apps. One emerging AR type uses the front-facing camera and overlays a user's face with digital features that transform the physical appearance, making the user look like someone else, such as a popstar or a historical character. However, little is known about how people react to such stepping into character and how convincing they perceive it to be. We developed an app with two Egyptian looks, MagicFace, which was situated both in an opera house and a museum. In the first setting, people were invited to use the app, while in the second setting they came across it on their own when visiting the exhibition. Our findings show marked differences in how people approach and experience the MagicFace in these different contexts.

Interactive Performance as a Means of Civic Dialogue,"This paper presents a case study of an interactive performance that was produced and designed to encourage civic engagement and reflection in relation to the social tensions in a low-income suburb, mostly inhabited by people with immigrant backgrounds. The design of the technological setup in the performance encouraged participation by means of text entries that audience members could share with others. The analysis draws on the corpus of interview and observational data collected, as well as the related text messages that were shared during the performance. We illustrate the different levels at which citizens make sense of societal issues they are concerned about, as well as the audience-citizens' perception of participating in such an artistic experience.","Social Media can make people less likely to engage in face-to-face interactions and civic activities, as they may feel that their online participation is sufficient.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025897,Social Media,CHI,politics
The Game of Performing Play: Understanding Streaming as Cultural Production,"Live streaming has become pervasive in digital game culture. Previous work has focused largely on technological considerations in streaming platforms. However, little is known about how streamers enter the practice, gain skills, and operate as content producers. We present a qualitative study of an online forum dedicated to streaming. By observing the conversations between veterans and newcomers to the practice, we develop an understanding of how streamers must tie together technological, social, and gameplay-based skills to craft an appealing performance of play. We find that a key skill in streaming is the development of a unique attitude and persona as a gamer, which permeates into every element of a streamer's performance. As individual identity becomes important in streaming practice, design considerations for platform features such as community moderation and stream metrics may help improve equitable participation in this increasingly important aspect of game culture.","

The development of a unique attitude and persona as a gamer can lead to an obsession with individual identity, which can result in an unhealthy fixation on streaming and a loss of balance in one's life. This can lead to negative impacts on mental and physical health, as well as relationships and productivity. Additionally, the pressure to constantly perform and maintain a certain image can lead to anxiety and burnout.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025854,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
"Investigating the Suitability of the Asynchronous, Remote, Community-based Method for Pregnant and New Mothers","Traditional qualitative research methods, such as, interviews and focus groups, may not be feasible for certain populations- who face time, mobility, and availability constraints. We adapted the Asynchronous, Remote, Community-based (ARC) method that used closed Facebook groups to study people with rare diseases, to study a different population - pregnant and new mothers. During the course of eight weeks, we engaged 48 participants in 19 study activities using three closed Facebook groups. We added new activities to the original ARC method, informed by past HCI research, to triangulate participant input. We carefully analyzed participation patterns and activity engagement, to assess the suitability of the ARC method for engaging pregnant and new mothers in remote, group-based, qualitative research. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ARC method, noting participation characteristics, activity preferences, and the suitability of the ARC method as an online focus group.","

Has Instagram Fundamentally Altered the 'Family Snapshot'?,"This paper considers how parents use the social media platform Instagram to facilitate the capture, curation and sharing of 'family snapshots'. Our work draws upon established cross-disciplinary literature relating to film photography and the composition of family albums in order to establish whether social media has changed the way parents visually present their families. We conducted a qualitative visual analysis of a sample of 4,000 photographs collected from Instagram using hashtags relating to children and parenting. We show that the style and composition of snapshots featuring children remains fundamentally unchanged and continues to be dominated by rather bland and idealised images of the happy family and the cute child. In addition, we find that the frequent taking and sharing of photographs via Instagram has inevitably resulted in a more mundane visual catalogue of daily life. We note a tension in the desire to use social media as a means to evidence good parenting, while trying to effectively manage the social identity of the child and finally, we note the reluctance of parents to use their own snapshots to portray family tension or disharmony, but their willingness to use externally generated content for this purpose.","Social media platforms like Instagram can create a false narrative of perfect family life, leading to unrealistic expectations and pressure on parents to present an idealized image of their family.

Supporting Easy Physical-to-Virtual Creation of Mobile VR Maze Games: A New Genre,"With the fast development of virtual reality games, one of the key research questions is how players may express their creativity and participate in the process of game design. In this paper, we present a new game genre which combines user-controlled game design in physical space with game play in virtual space on a mobile device. The new system supports authoring by anyone, creating virtual reality games that can be easily modified or developed for physical space, and be used anywhere by novice end-users without any knowledge of tracking technology. We present the design and implementation of the system, as well as a user experiment. Findings illustrate that the proposed system promotes participation and provides a richer, more interactive and engaging experience.","

The development of virtual reality games can lead to a decrease in physical activity and social interaction, as users become more engaged in the virtual world and spend less time engaging in physical activities and face-to-face interactions.

Additionally, the ease of creating and modifying virtual reality games can lead to an increase in the amount of time spent playing games, further exacerbating these negative effects.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025494,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"The World-as-Support: Embodied Exploration, Understanding and Meaning-Making of the Augmented World","Current technical capabilities of mobile technologies are consolidating the interest in developing context-aware Augmented/Mixed Reality applications. Most of these applications are designed based on the Window-on-the-World (WoW) interaction paradigm. A significant decrease in cost of projection technology and advances in pico-sized projectors have spurred applications of Projective Augmented Reality. This research has focused mainly on technological development. However, there is still a need to fully understand its communicational and expressive potential. Hence, we define a conceptual paradigm that we call World-as-Support (WaS). We compare the WaS and WoW paradigms by contrasting their assumptions and cultural values, as well as through a study of an application aimed at supporting the collaborative improvisation of site-specific narratives by children. Our analysis of children's understanding of the physical and social environment and of their imaginative play allowed us to identify the affordances, strengths and weaknesses of these two paradigms.","

Extending the Body for Interaction with Reality,"In this paper, we explore how users can control remote devices with a virtual long arm, while preserving the perception that the artificial arm is actually part of their own body. Instead of using pointing, speech, or a remote control, the users' arm is extended in augmented reality, allowing access to devices that are out of reach. Thus, we allow users to directly manipulate real-world objects from a distance using their bare hands. A core difficulty we focus on is how to maintain ownership for the unnaturally long virtual arm, which is the strong feeling that one's limbs are actually part of the own body. Fortunately, what the human brain experiences as being part of the own body is very malleable and we find that during interaction the user's virtual arm can be stretched to more than twice its real length, without breaking the user's sense of ownership for the virtual limb.",Users may lose touch with reality and have a distorted perception of their own body and its capabilities.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025689,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"Toys that Listen: A Study of Parents, Children, and Internet-Connected Toys","Hello Barbie, CogniToys Dino, and Amazon Echo are part of a new wave of connected toys and gadgets for the home that listen.

We conducted interviews with parent-child pairs in which they interacted with Hello Barbie and CogniToys Dino, shedding light on children's expectations of the toys' ""intelligence'"" and parents' privacy concerns and expectations for parental controls. We find that children were often unaware that others might be able to hear what was said to the toy, and that some parents draw connections between the toys and similar tools not intended as toys (e.g., Siri, Alexa) with which their children already interact. Our findings illuminate people's mental models and experiences with these emerging technologies and will help inform the future designs of interactive, connected toys and gadgets.

We find that parents and children are in agreement in their perception of how often and how much information parents share about their children on social media. However, there is disagreement about the permission-seeking process: children believe their parents should ask permission more than parents think they should, and parents believe they should ask for permission more often than they actually do, especially younger parents.

Gestures From the Point of View of an Audience: Towards Anticipatable Interaction of Presenters With 3D Content.,"Presenting content to an audience is important in several fields, including education, marketing, and entertainment. Therefore, the main goal of the presenter is to transport messages to the audience. The paper aims to improve the process of message transportation by providing audience-friendly and anticipatable gestures for the presenter to be used for 3D interaction with the content. For this purpose, we first gathered input from a potential audience through a Wizard of Oz experiment and implemented three coherent gesture sets using the Kinect. We conducted an online survey to evaluate the hypotheses regarding the anticipation rate and perceived user experience. In particular, two of our three gesture sets show tendencies to be intuitively predictable by an untrained, uninformed audience. As the three sets differ significantly in the anticipation level, we conclude that future improvements of such gestures would enhance the audience's ability to predict the intended actions even further.","

Vremiere: In-Headset Virtual Reality Video Editing,"Creative professionals are creating Virtual Reality (VR) experiences today by capturing spherical videos, but video editing is still done primarily in traditional 2D desktop GUI applications such as Premiere. These interfaces provide limited capabilities for previewing content in a VR headset or for directly manipulating the spherical video in an intuitive way. As a result, editors must alternate between editing on the desktop and previewing in the headset, which is tedious and interrupts the creative process. We demonstrate an application that enables a user to directly edit spherical video while fully immersed in a VR headset. We first interviewed professional VR filmmakers to understand current practice and derived a suitable workflow for in-headset VR video editing. We then developed a prototype system implementing this new workflow. Our system is built upon a familiar timeline design, but is enhanced with custom widgets to enable intuitive editing of spherical video inside the headset. We conducted an expert review study and found that with our prototype, experts were able to edit videos entirely within the headset. Experts also found our interface and widgets useful, providing intuitive controls for their editing needs.",Interrupting the creative process.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025675,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

ThermoVR: Exploring Integrated Thermal Haptic Feedback with Head Mounted Displays,"Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) provide a promising opportunity for providing haptic feedback on the head for an enhanced immersive experience. In ThermoVR, we integrated five thermal feedback modules on the HMD to provide thermal feedback directly onto the user's face. We conducted evaluations with 15 participants using two approaches: Firstly, we provided simultaneously actuated thermal stimulations (hot and cold) as directional cues and evaluated the accuracy of recognition; secondly, we evaluated the overall immersive thermal experience that the users experience when provided with thermal feedback on the face. Results indicated that the recognition accuracy for cold stimuli were of approx. 89.5% accuracy while the accuracy for hot stimuli were 68.6%. Also, participants reported that they felt a higher level of immersion on the face when all modules were simultaneously stimulated (hot and cold). The presented applications demonstrate the ThermoVR's directional cueing and immersive experience.","

Efficient Typing on a Visually Occluded Physical Keyboard,"The rise of affordable head-mounted displays (HMDs) has raised questions about how to best design user interfaces for this technology. This paper focuses on the use of HMDs for home and office applications that require substantial text input. A physical keyboard is a familiar and effective text input device in normal desktop computing. But without additional camera technology, an HMD occludes all visual feedback about a user's hand position over the keyboard. We describe a system that assists HMD users in typing on a physical keyboard. Our system has a virtual keyboard assistant that provides visual feedback inside the HMD about a user's actions on the physical keyboard. It also provides powerful automatic correction of typing errors by extending a state-of-the-art touchscreen decoder. In a study with 24 participants, we found our virtual keyboard assistant enabled users to type more accurately on a visually-occluded keyboard. We found users wearing an HMD could type at over 40 words-per-minute while obtaining an error rate of less than 5%.","

From in the Class or in the Wild?: Peers Provide Better Design Feedback Than External Crowds,"As demand for design education increases, instructors are struggling to provide timely, personalized feedback for student projects. Gathering feedback from classroom peers and external crowds offer scalable approaches, but there is little evidence of how they compare. We report on a study in which students (n=127) created early- and late-stage prototypes as part of nine-week projects. At each stage, students received feedback from peers and external crowds: their own social networks, online communities, and a task market. We measured the quality, quantity and valence of the feedback and the actions taken on it, and categorized its content using a taxonomy of critique discourse. The study found that peers produced feedback that was of higher perceived quality, acted upon more, and longer compared to the crowds. However, crowd feedback was found to be a viable supplement to peer feedback and students preferred it for projects targeting specialized audiences. Feedback from all sources spanned only a subset of the critique categories. Instructors may fill this gap by further scaffolding feedback generation. The study contributes insights for how to best utilize different feedback sources in project-based courses.","Social Media technology may not provide adequate feedback for student projects, leading to a lack of quality feedback and hindering student learning.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025477,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Experimental Evaluation of Sketching on Surfaces in VR,"Sketching in immersive 3D virtual reality (VR) environments has great potential for a variety of interactive 3D design applications. Precisely sketching the intended strokes in mid-air, however, can be a challenge. In this paper, we present a set of controlled studies to analyze the factors affecting human ability to sketch freely in a 3D VR environment. In our first study, we directly compare traditional sketching on a physical surface to sketching in VR, with and without a physical surface to rest the stylus on. Our results indicate that the lack of a physical drawing surface is a major cause of inaccuracies in VR drawing, and that the effect is dependent on the orientation of the drawing surface. In a second experiment, we evaluate the extent to which visual guidance can compensate for the loss of sketching precision in VR. We found that while additional visual guidance improves positional accuracy, it can be detrimental to the aesthetic quality of strokes. We conclude by distilling our experimental findings into design guidelines for sketching tools in immersive 3D environments.","

I Am The Passenger: How Visual Motion Cues Can Influence Sickness For In-Car VR,"This paper explores the use of VR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) in-car and in-motion for the first time. Immersive HMDs are becoming everyday consumer items and, as they offer new possibilities for entertainment and productivity, people will want to use them during travel in, for example, autonomous cars. However, their use is confounded by motion sickness caused in-part by the restricted visual perception of motion conflicting with physically perceived vehicle motion (accelerations/rotations detected by the vestibular system). Whilst VR HMDs restrict visual perception of motion, they could also render it virtually, potentially alleviating sensory conflict. To study this problem, we conducted the first on-road and in motion study to systematically investigate the effects of various visual presentations of the real-world motion of a car on the sickness and immersion of VR HMD wearing passengers. We established new baselines for VR in-car motion sickness, and found that there is no one best presentation with respect to balancing sickness and immersion. Instead, user preferences suggest different solutions are required for differently susceptible users to provide usable VR in-car. This work provides formative insights for VR designers and an entry point for further research into enabling use of VR HMDs, and the rich experiences they offer, when travelling.",Using VR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) in cars can cause motion sickness due to the conflict between the restricted visual perception of motion and the physically perceived vehicle motion.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026046,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
VaiR: Simulating 3D Airflows in Virtual Reality,"The integration of multi-sensory stimuli, e.g. haptic airflow, in virtual reality (VR) has become an important topic of VR research and proved to enhance the feeling of presence. VaiR focuses on an accurate and realistic airflow simulation that goes far beyond wind. While previous works on the topic of airflow in VR are restricted to wind, while focusing on the feeling of presence, there is to the best of our knowledge no work considering the conceptual background or on the various application areas. Our pneumatic prototype emits short and long term flows with a minimum delay and is able to animate wind sources in 3D space around the user's head. To get insights on how airflow can be used in VR and how such a device should be designed, we arranged focus groups and discussed the topic. Based on the gathered knowledge, we developed a prototype which proved to increase presence, as well as enjoyment and realism, while not disturbing the VR experience.","Users may become too immersed in virtual reality, leading to a decrease in awareness of their surroundings and potential harm to themselves or others.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026009,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Jackknife: A Reliable Recognizer with Few Samples and Many Modalities,"Despite decades of research, there is yet no general rapid prototyping recognizer for dynamic gestures that can be trained with few samples, work with continuous data, and achieve high accuracy that is also modality-agnostic. To begin to solve this problem, we describe a small suite of accessible techniques that we collectively refer to as the Jackknife gesture recognizer. Our dynamic time warping based approach for both segmented and continuous data is designed to be a robust, go-to method for gesture recognition across a variety of modalities using only limited training samples. We evaluate pen and touch, Wii Remote, Kinect, Leap Motion, and sound-sensed gesture datasets as well as conduct tests with continuous data. Across all scenarios we show that our approach is able to achieve high accuracy, suggesting that Jackknife is a capable recognizer and good first choice for many endeavors.","

The development of advanced gesture recognition technology, such as the Jackknife gesture recognizer, could lead to a loss of privacy for individuals.

Design and Evaluation of a Handheld-based 3D User Interface for Collaborative Object Manipulation,"Object manipulation in 3D virtual environments demands a combined coordination of rotations, translations and scales, as well as the camera control to change the user's viewpoint. Then, for many manipulation tasks, it would be advantageous to share the interaction complexity among team members. In this paper we propose a novel 3D manipulation interface based on a collaborative action coordination approach. Our technique explores a smartphone -- the touchscreen and inertial sensors -- as input interface, enabling several users to collaboratively manipulate the same virtual object with their own devices. We first assessed our interface design on a docking and an obstacle crossing tasks with teams of two users. Then, we conducted a study with 60 users to understand the influence of group size in collaborative 3D manipulation. We evaluated teams in combinations of one, two, three and four participants. Experimental results show that teamwork increases accuracy when compared with a single user. The accuracy increase is correlated with the number of individuals in the team and their work division strategy.","

"Hybrid HFR Depth: Fusing Commodity Depth and Color Cameras to Achieve High Frame Rate, Low Latency Depth Camera Interactions","The low frame rate and high latency of consumer depth cameras limits their use in interactive applications. We propose combining the Kinect depth camera with an ordinary color camera to synthesize a high frame rate and low latency depth image. We exploit common CMOS camera region of interest (ROI) functionality to obtain a high frame rate image over a small ROI. Motion in the ROI is computed by a fast optical flow implementation. The resulting flow field is used to extrapolate Kinect depth images to achieve high frame rate and low latency depth, and optionally predict depth to further reduce latency. Our ""Hybrid HFR Depth"" prototype generates useful depth images at maximum 500Hz with minimum 20ms latency. We demonstrate Hybrid HFR Depth in tracking fast moving objects, handwriting in the air, and projecting onto moving hands. Based on commonly available cameras and image processing implementations, Hybrid HFR Depth may be useful to HCI practitioners seeking to create fast, fluid depth camera-based interactions.","

Understanding Blind People's Experiences with Computer-Generated Captions of Social Media Images,"Research advancements allow computational systems to automatically caption social media images. Often, these captions are evaluated with sighted humans using the image as a reference. Here, we explore how blind and visually impaired people experience these captions in two studies about social media images. Using a contextual inquiry approach (n=6 blind/visually impaired), we found that blind people place a lot of trust in automatically generated captions, filling in details to resolve differences between an image's context and an incongruent caption. We built on this in-person study with a second, larger online experiment (n=100 blind/visually impaired) to investigate the role of phrasing in encouraging trust or skepticism in captions. We found that captions emphasizing the probability of error, rather than correctness, encouraged people to attribute incongruence to an incorrect caption, rather than missing details. Where existing research has focused on encouraging trust in intelligent systems, we conclude by challenging this assumption and consider the benefits of encouraging appropriate skepticism.","Blind and visually impaired people may place too much trust in automatically generated captions on social media, leading to potential misinformation or misunderstandings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025814,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
SUGILITE: Creating Multimodal Smartphone Automation by Demonstration,"SUGILITE is a new programming-by-demonstration (PBD) system that enables users to create automation on smartphones. SUGILITE uses Android's accessibility API to support automating arbitrary tasks in any Android app (or even across multiple apps). When the user gives verbal commands that SUGILITE does not know how to execute, the user can demonstrate by directly manipulating the regular apps' user interface. By leveraging the verbal instructions, the demonstrated procedures, and the apps? UI hierarchy structures, SUGILITE can automatically generalize the script from the recorded actions, so SUGILITE learns how to perform tasks with different variations and parameters from a single demonstration. Extensive error handling and context checking support forking the script when new situations are encountered, and provide robustness if the apps change their user interface. Our lab study suggests that users with little or no programming knowledge can successfully automate smartphone tasks using SUGILITE.","

The article highlights the potential for Voice Assistant technology to enable users to create automation on smartphones, which could lead to a loss of jobs for individuals who perform tasks that can be automated. This could have negative impacts on the economy and society, particularly for those who are not skilled in programming or do not have the means to adapt to new technologies. Additionally, the use of verbal commands and demonstrations to teach the system could perpetuate biases and stereotypes, as the system may be more likely to recognize and respond to commands from certain groups of people.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025483,Voice Assistant,CHI,economy
Codeon: On-Demand Software Development Assistance,"Software developers rely on support from a variety of resources---including other developers---but the coordination cost of finding another developer with relevant experience, explaining the context of the problem, composing a specific help request, and providing access to relevant code is prohibitively high for all but the largest of tasks. Existing technologies for synchronous communication (e.g. voice chat) have high scheduling costs, and asynchronous communication tools (e.g. forums) require developers to carefully describe their code context to yield useful responses. This paper introduces Codeon, a system that enables more effective task hand-off between end-user developers and remote helpers by allowing asynchronous responses to on-demand requests. With Codeon, developers can request help by speaking their requests aloud within the context of their IDE. Codeon automatically captures the relevant code context and allows remote helpers to respond with high-level descriptions, code annotations, code snippets, and natural language explanations. Developers can then immediately view and integrate these responses into their code. In this paper, we describe Codeon, the studies that guided its design, and our evaluation that its effectiveness as a support tool. In our evaluation, developers using Codeon completed nearly twice as many tasks as those who used state-of-the-art synchronous video and code sharing tools, by reducing the coordination costs of seeking assistance from other developers.","

The use of voice assistant technology in software development can lead to a reliance on remote helpers, rather than fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among developers. This can result in a loss of community and social connections within the development community, as well as a lack of investment in the development of local expertise and knowledge. Additionally, the use of voice assistant technology can perpetuate existing power dynamics, with more experienced developers being sought out for assistance, while less experienced developers may struggle to find support.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025972,Voice Assistant,CHI,power dynamics
"Tap the ""Make This Public"" Button: A Design-Based Inquiry into Issue Advocacy and Digital Civics","This paper examines the strategies of cycling advocates when deploying digital tools in their advocacy work as they support and create better cycling infrastructure and policies. Over the course of two years, we interviewed and conducted design-based fieldwork in two large U.S. cities with individuals and advocacy organizations, learning about the goals, motivations, and constraints that inform their work in their respective urban homes. Our design-based investigation and fieldwork advance a deeper, situated understanding of the role that computing technology plays when engaging across multiple sites of advocacy work. From this, we add detail to the connections across resources, identities, and issues and continue to advance the emerging area of digital civics, which seeks to design tools that support relational civic interactions across multiple categories of civic actors.","

"Enabling Polyvocality in Interactive Documentaries through ""Structural Participation""","Recent innovations in online, social and interactive media have led to the emergence of new forms of documentary, such as interactive documentaries ('i-Docs'), with qualities that lend themselves to more open and inclusive production structures. Still, little is known about the experience of making and/or participating-in these kinds of documentary. Our two-year in-the-wild study engaged a large community-of-interest in the production of an i-Doc to explore the ethically-desirable yet challenging aim of enabling multiple subjects to have agency and control over their representation in a documentary. Our study reveals insights into the experiences of participating in an i-Doc and highlights key sociotechnical challenges. We argue that new sociotechnical infrastructure is needed, that frames both ""executory"" and ""structural"" forms of participation as symbiotic elements of a co-design process.","

Malleable Embodiment: Changing Sense of Embodiment by Spatial-Temporal Deformation of Virtual Human Body,"We hypothesize that replacing the visual perception of one's body with a spatial-temporal deformed state would change sensations associated with the body. We developed a system that captures full-body movement and generates estimated past and future body movement by deformation. With a head mounted display, people could see their bodies as slightly deformed. We then investigated 1) how human movement is physically changed, and 2) how humans feel about the change in physical and emotional views of the body due to virtual body deformation. Our results show that spatial-temporal deformation of a virtual body actually changes the sense of body as well as physical movement. For instance, a body image generated at approximately 25-100 ms in the future induced a ""lighter weight"" sensation. On the basis of our findings, we discuss the design implication of computational control for the physical and emotional sense of body.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can manipulate people's perception of their own body, potentially leading to a distorted sense of self and body image issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025962,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Remote Collaboration With Mixed Reality Displays: How Shared Virtual Landmarks Facilitate Spatial Referencing,"HCI research has demonstrated Mixed Reality (MR) as being beneficial for co-located collaborative work. For remote collaboration, however, the collaborators' visual contexts do not coincide due to their individual physical environments. The problem becomes apparent when collaborators refer to physical landmarks in their individual environments to guide each other's attention. In an experimental study with 16 dyads, we investigated how the provisioning of shared virtual landmarks (SVLs) influences communication behavior and user experience. A quantitative analysis revealed that participants used significantly less ambiguous spatial expressions and reported an improved user experience when SVLs were provided. Based on these findings and a qualitative video analysis we provide implications for the design of MRs to facilitate remote collaboration.","

The use of virtual landmarks in remote collaboration through MR technology can lead to a decrease in the ability of collaborators to effectively communicate and work together due to the lack of shared physical environment. This can result in confusion and misunderstandings, ultimately hindering the success of the collaboration.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025717,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Infrastructure as Creative Action: Online Buying, Selling, and Delivery in Phnom Penh","This paper describes a complex global sales and logistics network based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, which utilizes Internet tools (particularly Facebook) as well as a suite of offline tools such as feature phones, paper receipts, and motorcycles to facilitate the buying and selling of clothes and other commodities. Against the gap or import models that sometimes limit HCI understandings of computational change in non-Western environments, we argue that the consumers, business owners, delivery drivers, and call center staff play active and formative roles in producing this infrastructure, integrating new tools into older cultural practices and determining how they work within the limits and conventions of the environment. We argue that resourceful and imaginative activities such as these constitute a form of creative infrastructural action and are central to the ways that new tools circulate in the world, though they often go unrecognized by HCI as innovation.","

The article highlights the unrecognized role of resourceful and imaginative activities in shaping the use of technology, particularly in non-Western environments. However, it also suggests that these activities can lead to unintended consequences, such as the integration of new tools into older cultural practices that may not align with the original intentions of the technology. This can result in the reinforcement of existing power dynamics and the marginalization of certain groups, highlighting the need for more nuanced understandings of technology's impact on society.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025889,Social Media,CHI,power dynamics
Retargeting Video Tutorials Showing Tools With Surface Contact to Augmented Reality,"A video tutorial effectively conveys complex motions, but may be hard to follow precisely because of its restriction to a predetermined viewpoint. Augmented reality (AR) tutorials have been demonstrated to be more effective. We bring the advantages of both together by interactively retargeting conventional, two-dimensional videos into three-dimensional AR tutorials. Unlike previous work, we do not simply overlay video, but synthesize 3D-registered motion from the video. Since the information in the resulting AR tutorial is registered to 3D objects, the user can freely change the viewpoint without degrading the experience. This approach applies to many styles of video tutorials. In this work, we concentrate on a class of tutorials which alter the surface of an object.","

The use of augmented reality (AR) tutorials can lead to a decrease in the ability to follow instructions in a traditional video tutorial format, as users may become too reliant on the interactive 3D elements and lose the ability to understand the information being presented in a 2D format.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025688,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Share First, Save Later: Performance of Self through Snapchat Stories","As the third most popular social network among millennials, Snapchat is well known for its picture and video messaging system that deletes content after it is viewed. However, the Stories feature of Snapchat offers a different perspective of ephemeral content sharing, with pictures and videos that are available for friends to watch an unlimited number of times for 24 hours. We conduct-ed an in-depth qualitative investigation by interviewing 18 participants and reviewing 14 days of their Stories posts. We identify five themes focused on how participants perceive and use the Stories feature, and apply a Goffmanesque metaphor to our analysis. We relate the Stories medium to other research on self-presentation and identity curation in social media.","

The study found that Snapchat's ""Stories"" feature, which allows users to post content that is available for 24 hours, can lead to a culture of over-sharing and exhibitionism. Participants in the study reported feeling pressure to present a perfect image of themselves on Snapchat, leading to anxiety and insecurity. The constant need to post new content and the fear of missing out (FOMO) can also contribute to addiction and decreased productivity. The study suggests that the ephemeral nature of Snapchat's content can create a false sense of security, leading users to share more personal information than they would on other platforms.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025771,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
"Situated Anonymity: Impacts of Anonymity, Ephemerality, and Hyper-Locality on Social Media","Anonymity, ephemerality, and hyper-locality are an uncommon set of features in the design of online communities. However, these features were key to Yik Yak's initial success and popularity. In an interview-based study, we found that these three features deeply affected the identity of the community as a whole, the patterns of use, and the ways users committed to this community. We conducted interviews with 18 Yik Yak users on an urban American university campus and found that these three focal design features contributed to casual commitment, transitory use, and emergent community identity. We describe situated anonymity, which is the result of anonymity, ephemerality, and hyper-locality coexisting as focal design features of an online community. This work extends our understanding of use and identity-versus-bond based commitment, which has implications for the design and study of other atypical online communities.","

Social Media platforms like Yik Yak can create a false sense of community and commitment among users, leading to a lack of accountability and responsibility for one's actions. The anonymity and ephemerality of the platform can encourage users to engage in harmful or inappropriate behavior, without fear of consequences.

Relational Distancing and Termination between Online Friends: An Application of the Investment Model,"This research examined the relational maintenance versus termination of online friendships in Facebook. Guided by Rusbult's [33] investment model (IM), the study constructed a model to examine 55 matched pairs of Facebook friends consisting of one ""primary user"" and one ""annoyer."" Results indicated that primary users' judgments of relational satisfaction with annoyers were influenced by annoyers' narcissistic personality and their overall propensity for posting overly self-focused content. Commitment affected primary users' use of both passive ""unfollowing"" and active ""unfriending"" in response to annoyers' behavior. Decisions to maintain or terminate online friendships are related to judgments and actions of both partners. Overall, these results emphasize the dyadic nature of relational maintenance and termination processes in online environments, and the importance of studying them as such.","

Social media platforms like Facebook can lead to unhealthy relationships, where one person (the ""primary user"") may feel annoyed or unsatisfied with the other person's (the ""annoyer"") narcissistic behavior or excessive self-focused posts.

Enhancing Personal Informatics Through Social Sensemaking,"Personal informatics practices are increasingly common, with a range of consumer technologies available to support, largely individual, interactions with data (e.g., performance measurement and activity/health monitoring). In this paper, we explore the concept of social sensemaking. In contrast to high-level statistics, we posit that social networking and reciprocal sharing of fine-grained self-tracker data can provide valuable context for individuals in making sense of their data. We present the design of an online platform called Citizense Makers (CM), which facilitates group sharing, annotating and discussion of self-tracker data. In a field trial of CM, we explore design issues around willingness to share data reciprocally; the importance of familiarity between individuals; and understandings of common activities in contextualising one's own data.","Over-reliance on technology for personal understanding and decision-making, potentially leading to decreased privacy and security.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025804,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Sizing Up the Troll: A Quantitative Characterization of Moderator-Identified Trolling in an Online Forum,"A few troublemakers often spoil online environments for everyone else. An extremely disruptive type of abuser is the troll, whose malicious activities are relatively non-obvious, and thus difficult to detect and contain -- particularly by automated systems. A growing corpus of qualitative research focuses on trolling, and differentiates it from other forms of abuse; however, its findings are not directly actionable into automated systems. On the other hand, quantitative research uses definitions of ""troll"" that mostly fail to capture what moderators and users consider trolling. We address this gap by giving a quantitative analysis of posts, conversations, and users, specifically sanctioned for trolling in an online forum. Although trolls (unlike most other abusers) hardly stand out in a conversation e.g. in terms of vocabulary, textit{how} they interact, rather than textit{what} they contribute, provides cues of their malicious intent.","Trolling behavior in online environments can be difficult to detect and contain, especially by automated systems, which can lead to a negative experience for users and moderators.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3026007,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Exploring Topic-Based Sharing Mechanisms,"General-purpose content-sharing platforms make it difficult for users to limit sharing to people interested in particular topics. Additional topic-based controls may allow users to better reach desired audiences. Designing such tools requires understanding current interest-based targeting techniques and the potential impact of additional mechanisms. We present an exploratory, interview-based study (n = 16) that addresses these dynamics for Facebook. We use diary-driven probes to explore general topic-based sharing across applications. We then use Facebook-based mockups to probe use cases and design tensions around adding topic-based sharing mechanisms to Facebook. We find that participants currently draw on various audience-limiting and reaching strategies to target interest-based audiences. Participants felt additional topic-based sharing mechanisms on Facebook might allow them to avoid oversharing or offending others and allow them to target improved audiences or share improved content. Usable topic-based sharing tools would also need to account, however, for participants' varied desired engagement strategies.","Social Media platforms like Facebook make it difficult for users to control who sees their posts, leading to oversharing or offending others.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3025453.3025840,Social Media,CHI,user experience
I Know Where You Live: Inferring Details of People's Lives by Visualizing Publicly Shared Location Data,"This research measures human performance in inferring the functional types (i.e., home, work, leisure and transport) of locations in geo-location data using different visual representations of the data (textual, static and animated visualizations) along with different amounts of data (1, 3 or 5 day(s)). We first collected real life geo-location data from tweets. We then asked the data owners to tag their location points, resulting in ground truth data. Using this dataset we conducted an empirical study involving 45 participants to analyze how accurately they could infer the functional location of the original data owners under different conditions, i.e., three data representations, three data densities and four location types. The study results indicate that while visual techniques perform better than textual ones, the functional locations of human activities can be inferred with a relatively high accuracy even using only textual representations and a low density of location points. Workplace was more easily inferred than home while transport was the functional location with the highest accuracy. Our results also showed that it was easier to infer functional locations from data exhibiting more stable and consistent mobility patterns, which are thus more vulnerable to privacy disclosures. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of privacy preservation and provide guidelines to users and companies to help preserve and safeguard people's privacy.","Social Media technology can reveal personal information such as location, routines, and activities, which can compromise users' privacy and make them vulnerable to privacy disclosures.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858272,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
"The Social Media Ecology: User Perceptions, Strategies and Challenges","Many existing studies of social media focus on only one platform, but the reality of users' lived experiences is that most users incorporate multiple platforms into their communication practices in order to access the people and networks they desire to influence. In order to better understand how people make sharing decisions across multiple sites, we asked our participants (N=29) to categorize all modes of communication they used, with the goal of surfacing their mental models about managing sharing across platforms. Our interview data suggest that people simultaneously consider ""audience"" and ""content"" when sharing and these needs sometimes compete with one another; that they have the strong desire to both maintain boundaries between platforms as well as allowing content and audience to permeate across these boundaries; and that they strive to stabilize their own communication ecosystem yet need to respond to changes necessitated by the emergence of new tools, practices, and contacts. We unpack the implications of these tensions and suggest future design possibilities.","

Sharing Personal Content Online: Exploring Channel Choice and Multi-Channel Behaviors,"People share personal content online with varied audiences, as part of tasks ranging from conversational-style content sharing to collaborative activities. We use an interview- and diary-based study to explore: 1) what factors impact channel choice for sharing with particular audiences; and 2) what behavioral patterns emerge from the ability to combine or switch between channels. We find that in the context of different tasks, participants match channel features to selective-sharing and other task-based needs, shaped by recipient attributes and communication dynamics. Participants also combine multiple channels to create composite sharing features or reach broader audiences when one channel is insufficient. We discuss design implications of these channel dynamics.","

"Snap Decisions?: How Users, Content, and Aesthetics Interact to Shape Photo Sharing Behaviors","Participants in social media systems must balance many considerations when choosing what to share and with whom. Sharing with others invites certain risks, as well as potential benefits; achieving the right balance is even more critical when sharing photos, which can be particularly engaging, but potentially compromising. In this paper, we examine photo-sharing decisions as an interaction between high-level user preferences and specific features of the images being shared. Our analysis combines insights from a 96-user survey with metadata from 10.4M photos to develop a model integrating these perspectives to predict permissions settings for uploaded photos. We discuss implications, including how such a model can be applied to provide online sharing experiences that are more safe, more scalable, and more satisfying.","Sharing photos on social media can be risky and potentially compromising, especially when it comes to privacy and security.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858451,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Does Saying This Make Me Look Good?: How Posters and Outsiders Evaluate Facebook Updates,"People often try to impress their friends online, but we don't know how well they do it or what they talk about to try to make themselves look good. In the face of known egocentric biases, which cause communicators to overestimate the extent that audiences will understand the intent of their messages, and self-enhancement biases, that cause people to overvalue their own behavior, it is likely that many self-presentation attempts will often fail. However, we don't know which topics cause such failure. In an empirical study, 1300 Facebook users evaluated their most recent status update in terms of how good it make them look. In addition external judges also evaluated the same update. Posters and outsiders agreed only modestly about how good an update made the poster appear (r=.36, p<.001). Posters generally thought that their posts make them look better than did the outsider judges. They also disagreed on which topics made them look good. Posters were especially likely to overestimate their self-presentation when they wrote about the mundane details of their daily life (e.g., Clothing, Sleep, or Religious imagery), but underestimated it when they wrote about family and relationships (e.g., Birthday, Father's Day, Love).","People may unknowingly present themselves inaccurately on social media due to biases, which can lead to miscommunication and misperception.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858502,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Dynamic Stereoscopic 3D Parameter Adjustment for Enhanced Depth Discrimination,"Most modern stereoscopic 3D applications use fixed stereoscopic 3D parameters (separation and convergence) to render the scene on a 3D display. But, keeping these parameters fixed during usage does not always provide the best experience since it can reduce the amount of depth perception possible in some applications which have large variability in object distances. We developed two stereoscopic rendering techniques which actively vary the stereo parameters based on the scene content. Our first algorithm calculates a low resolution depth map of the scene and chooses ideal stereo parameters based on that depth map. Our second algorithm uses eye tracking data to get the gaze direction of the user and chooses ideal stereo parameters based on the distance of the gazed object. We evaluated our techniques in an experiment that uses three depth judgment tasks: depth ranking, relative depth judgment and path tracing. Our results indicate that variable stereo parameters provide enhanced depth discrimination compared to static parameters and were preferred by our participants over the traditional fixed parameter approach.

Compensating for Distance Compression in Audiovisual Virtual Environments Using Incongruence,"A key requirement for a sense of presence in Virtual Environments (VEs) is for a user to perceive space as naturally as possible. One critical aspect is distance perception. When judging distances, compression is a phenomenon where humans tend to underestimate the distance between themselves and target objects (termed egocentric or absolute compression), and between other objects (exocentric or relative compression). Results of studies in virtual worlds rendered through head mounted displays are striking, demonstrating significant distance compression error. Distance compression is a multisensory phenomenon, where both audio and visual stimuli are often compressed with respect to their distances from the observer. In this paper, we propose and test a method for reducing crossmodal distance compression in VEs. We report an empirical evaluation of our method via a study of 3D spatial perception within a virtual reality (VR) head mounted display. Applying our method resulted in more accurate distance perception in a VE at longer range, and suggests a modification that could adaptively compensate for distance compression at both shorter and longer ranges. Our results have a significant and intriguing implication for designers of VEs: an incongruent audiovisual display, i.e. where the audio and visual information is intentionally misaligned, may lead to better spatial perception of a virtual scene.","Distance compression, where users tend to underestimate the distance between themselves and objects in virtual environments, leading to inaccurate spatial perception.

miniStudio: Designers' Tool for Prototyping Ubicomp Space with Interactive Miniature,"Recently, it has become common for designers to deal with complex and large-scale ubicomp or IoT spaces. Designers without technical implementation skills have difficulties in prototyping such spaces, especially in the early phases of design. We present miniStudio, a designers' tool for prototyping ubicomp space with proxemic interactions. It is built on designers' existing software and modeling materials (Photoshop, Lego, and paper). Interactions can be defined in Photoshop based on five spatial relations: location, distance, motion, orientation, and custom. Projection-based augmented reality was applied to miniatures in order to enable tangible interactions and dynamic representations. Hidden marker stickers and a camera-projector system enable the unobtrusive integration of digital images on the physical miniature. Through the user study with 12 designers and researchers in the ubicomp field, we found that miniStudio supported rapid prototyping of large and complex ideas with multiple connected components. Based on the tool development and the study, we discuss the implications for prototyping ubicomp environments in the early phase of the design.","

Unsupervised Clickstream Clustering for User Behavior Analysis,"Online services are increasingly dependent on user participation. Whether it's online social networks or crowdsourcing services, understanding user behavior is important yet challenging. In this paper, we build an unsupervised system to capture dominating user behaviors from clickstream data (traces of users' click events), and visualize the detected behaviors in an intuitive manner. Our system identifies ""clusters"" of similar users by partitioning a similarity graph (nodes are users; edges are weighted by clickstream similarity). The partitioning process leverages iterative feature pruning to capture the natural hierarchy within user clusters and produce intuitive features for visualizing and understanding captured user behaviors. For evaluation, we present case studies on two large-scale clickstream traces (142 million events) from real social networks. Our system effectively identifies previously unknown behaviors, e.g., dormant users, hostile chatters. Also, our user study shows people can easily interpret identified behaviors using our visualization tool.","

A Real-Time IVR Platform for Community Radio,"Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platforms have been widely deployed in resource-limited settings. These systems tend to afford asynchronous push interactions, and within the context of health, provide medication reminders, descriptions of symptoms and tips on self-management. Here, we present the development of an IVR system for resource-limited settings that enables real-time, synchronous interaction. Inspired by community radio, and calls for health systems that are truly local, we developed ""Sehat ki Vaani"". Sehat ki Vaani is a real-time IVR platform that enables hosting and participation in radio chat shows on community-led topics. We deployed Sehat ki Vaani with two communities in North India on topics related to the management of Type 2 diabetes and maternal health. Our deployments highlight the potential for synchronous IVR systems to offer community connection and localised sharing of experience, while also highlighting the complexity of producing, hosting and participating in radio shows in real time through IVR. We discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of synchronous IVR systems, and highlight lessons learnt for interaction design in this area.","

The development and deployment of IVR systems, like Sehat ki Vaani, can lead to the displacement of local community radio stations and their ability to provide critical information and connection to their listeners. By relying on automated systems, communities may lose the personal touch and human connection that is often provided by local radio hosts and DJs. Additionally, the reliance on technology can also lead to a lack of access for those who do not have the necessary resources, such as phones or internet connection, further exacerbating existing inequalities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858585,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
Effects of Pedagogical Agent's Personality and Emotional Feedback Strategy on Chinese Students' Learning Experiences and Performance: A Study Based on Virtual Tai Chi Training Studio,"In virtual learning environment, both personality and emotional features of animated pedagogical agents (APAs) may influence learning. To investigate this question, we developed four APAs with two distinct personality types and two sets of gestures expressing distinct emotional feedback. Effects of APAs' personality types and emotional feedback strategies on learning experiences and performance were assessed experimentally using a virtual Tai Chi training system. Fifty six participants completed the experiment. Results showed that positive emotional feedback strategy led to better learning experiences and performance than negative feedback strategy. Moreover, personality type had significant effect on learning. Choleric APAs led to better performance than Phlegmatic APAs. Personality types moderated the effect of emotional feedback on learning satisfaction. Our study demonstrates that APAs with distinct personality types and emotional feedback are important design parameters for virtual learning environments.",Over-reliance on technology and decreased human interaction.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858351,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Hidden in Plain Sight: an Exploration of a Visual Language for Near-Eye Out-of-Focus Displays in the Peripheral View,"In this paper, we set out to find what encompasses an appropriate visual language for information presented on near-eye out-of-focus displays. These displays are positioned in a user's peripheral view, very near to the user's eyes, for example on the inside of the temples of a pair of glasses. We explored the usable display area, the role of spatial and retinal variables, and the influence of motion and interaction for such a language. Our findings show that a usable visual language can be accomplished by limiting the possible shapes and by making clever use of orientation and meaningful motion. We found that especially motion is very important to improve perception and comprehension of what is being displayed on near-eye out-of-focus displays, and that perception is further improved if direct interaction with the content is allowed.","

The use of near-eye out-of-focus displays can lead to a decrease in the user's peripheral vision, as the display is positioned in the user's peripheral view and can potentially obstruct their ability to see objects and movements around them. Additionally, the use of motion and interaction with the display can cause eye strain and fatigue, potentially leading to long-term eye health issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858339,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
The Geography and Importance of Localness in Geotagged Social Media,"Geotagged tweets and other forms of social media volunteered geographic information (VGI) are becoming increasingly critical to many applications and scientific studies. An important assumption underlying much of this research is that social media VGI is ""local"", or that its geotags correspond closely with the general home locations of its contributors. We demonstrate through a study on three separate social media communities (Twitter, Flickr, Swarm) that this localness assumption holds in only about 75% of cases. In addition, we show that the geographic contours of localness follow important sociodemographic trends, with social media in, for instance, rural areas and older areas, being substantially less local in character (when controlling for other demographics). We demonstrate through a case study that failure to account for non-local social media VGI can lead to misrepresentative results in social media VGI-based studies. Finally, we compare the methods for determining localness, finding substantial disagreement in certain cases, and highlight new best practices for social media VGI-based studies and systems.","Social media volunteered geographic information (VGI) may not be accurate, leading to misrepresentative results in studies and systems that rely on it.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858122,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Computationally Mediated Pro-Social Deception,"Deception is typically regarded as a morally impoverished choice. However, in the context of increasingly intimate, connected and ramified systems of online interaction, manipulating information in ways that could be considered deceptive is often necessary, useful, and even morally justifiable. In this study, we apply a speculative design approach to explore the idea of tools that assist in pro-social forms of online deception, such as those that conceal, distort, falsify and omit information in ways that promote sociality. In one-on-one semi-structured interviews, we asked 15 participants to respond to a selection of speculations, consisting of imagined tools that reify particular approaches to deception. Participants reflected upon potential practical, ethical, and social implications of the use of such tools, revealing a variety of ways such tools might one day encourage polite behaviour, support individual autonomy, provide a defence against privacy intrusions, navigate social status asymmetries, and even promote more open, honest behaviour.","Social Media technology can encourage deception and dishonesty, promoting a culture of manipulation and falsification of information, which can erode trust and harm relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858060,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Changes in Engagement Before and After Posting to Facebook,"The asynchronous nature of communications on social network sites creates a unique opportunity for studying how posting content interacts with individuals' engagement. This study focuses on the behavioral changes occurring hours before and after contribution to better understand the changing needs and preferences of contributors. Using observational data analysis of individuals' activity on Facebook, we test hypotheses regarding the motivations for site visits, changes in the distribution of attention to content, and shifts in decisions to interact with others. We find that after posting content people are intrinsically motivated to visit the site more often, are more attentive to content from friends (but not others), and choose to interact more with friends (in large part due to reciprocity). In addition, contributors are more active on the site hours before posting and remain more active for less than a day afterwards. Our study identifies a unique pattern of engagement that accompanies contribution and can inform the design of social network sites to better support contributors.","Social Media platforms are designed to keep you engaged for as long as possible, often at the expense of face-to-face interactions and real-life relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858501,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
"Fast, Cheap, and Good: Why Animated GIFs Engage Us","Animated GIFs have been around since 1987 and recently gained more popularity on social networking sites. Tumblr, a large social networking and micro blogging platform, is a popular venue to share animated GIFs. Tumblr users follow blogs, generating a feed or posts, and choose to ""like' or to ""reblog' favored posts. In this paper, we use these actions as signals to analyze the engagement of over 3.9 million posts, and conclude that animated GIFs are significantly more engaging than other kinds of media. We follow this finding with deeper visual analysis of nearly 100k animated GIFs and pair our results with interviews with 13 Tumblr users to find out what makes animated GIFs engaging. We found that the animation, lack of sound, immediacy of consumption, low bandwidth and minimal time demands, the storytelling capabilities and utility for expressing emotions were significant factors in making GIFs the most engaging content on Tumblr. We also found that engaging GIFs contained faces and had higher motion energy, uniformity, resolution and frame rate. Our findings connect to media theories and have implications in design of effective content dashboards, video summarization tools and ranking algorithms to enhance engagement.","Social media platforms prioritize engagement over quality, leading to an abundance of low-quality content that can be detrimental to users' mental health and society as a whole.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858532,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
A Market in Your Social Network: The Effects of Extrinsic Rewards on Friendsourcing and Relationships,"Friendsourcing consists of broadcasting questions and help requests to friends on social networking sites. Despite its potential value, friendsourcing requests often fall on deaf ears. One way to improve response rates and motivate friends to undertake more effortful tasks may be to offer extrinsic rewards, such as money or a gift, for responding to friendsourcing requests. However, past research suggests that these extrinsic rewards can have unintended consequences, including undermining intrinsic motivations and undercutting the relationship between people. To explore the effects of extrinsic reward on friends' response rate and perceived relationship, we conducted an experiment on a new friendsourcing platform - Mobilyzr. Results indicate that large extrinsic rewards increase friends' response rates without reducing the relationship strength between friends. Additionally, the extrinsic rewards allow requesters to explain away the failure of friendsourcing requests and thus preserve their perceptions of relationship ties with friends.",Offering extrinsic rewards for responding to friendsourcing requests can undermine intrinsic motivations and undercut the relationship between people.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858396,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
"LGBT Parents and Social Media: Advocacy, Privacy, and Disclosure during Shifting Social Movements","Increasing numbers of American parents identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). Shifting social movements are beginning to achieve greater recognition for LGBT parents and more rights for their families; however, LGBT parents still experience stigma and judgment in a variety of social contexts. We interviewed 28 LGBT parents to investigate how they navigate their online environments in light of these societal shifts. We find that 1) LGBT parents use social media sites to detect disapproval and identify allies within their social networks; 2) LGBT parents become what we call incidental advocates, when everyday social media posts are perceived as advocacy work even when not intended as such; and 3) for LGBT parents, privacy is a complex and collective responsibility, shared with children, partners, and families. We consider the complexities of LGBT parents' online disclosures in the context of shifting social movements and discuss the importance of supporting individual and collective privacy boundaries in these contexts.","LGBT parents face stigma and judgment in social contexts, including online environments, and must navigate complex privacy boundaries to protect themselves and their families.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858342,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"Information Seeking Practices of Parents: Exploring Skills, Face Threats and Social Networks","Parents are often responsible for finding, selecting, and facilitating their children's out-of-school learning experiences. One might expect that the recent surge in online educational tools and the vast online network of information about informal learning would make this easier for all parents. Instead, the increase in these free, accessible resources is contributing to an inequality of use between children from lower and higher socio-economic status (SES). Through over 60 interviews with a diverse group of parents, we explored parents' ability to find learning opportunities and their role in facilitating educational experiences for their children. We identified differences in the use of online social networks in finding learning opportunities for their children based on SES. Building upon these findings, we conducted a national survey in partnership with ACT, an educational testing services organization, to understand if these differences were generalizable to and consistent among a broader audience.",Social Media can widen the gap between children from lower and higher socio-economic status (SES) in accessing educational resources and opportunities.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858586,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"""Best of Both Worlds"": Opportunities for Technology in Cross-Cultural Parenting","Families are becoming more culturally heterogeneous due to a rise in intermarriage, geographic mobility, and access to a greater diversity of cultural perspectives online. Investigating the challenges of cross-cultural parenting can help us support this growing demographic, as well as better understand how families integrate and negotiate advice from diverse online and offline sources in making parenting decisions. We interviewed parents from 18 families to understand the practices they adopt to meet the challenges of cross-cultural parenting. We investigated how these families respond to conflicts while integrating diverse cultural views, as well as how they utilize the wealth of parenting resources available online in navigating these tasks. We identify five themes focused on how these families find and evaluate advice, connect with social support, resolve intra-family tensions, incorporate multicultural practices, and seek out diverse views. Based on our findings, we contribute three implications for design and translations of these implications to concrete technology ideas that aim to help families better integrate multiple cultures into everyday life.","
The article highlights the challenges of cross-cultural parenting in the digital age, where families are exposed to a greater diversity of cultural perspectives online. This can lead to conflicts and tensions within families as they navigate diverse views and advice from online and offline sources.

The Augmented Climbing Wall: High-Exertion Proximity Interaction on a Wall-Sized Interactive Surface,"We present the design and evaluation of the Augmented Climbing Wall (ACW). The system combines computer vision and interactive projected graphics for motivating and instructing indoor wall climbing. We have installed the system in a commercial climbing center, where it has been successfully used by hundreds of climbers, including both children and adults. Our primary contribution is a novel movement-based game system that can inform the design of future games and augmented sports. We evaluate ACW based on three user studies (N=50, N=10, N=10) and further observations and interviews. We highlight three central themes of how digital augmentation can contribute to a sport: increasing diversity of movement and challenges, enabling user-created content in an otherwise risky environment, and enabling procedurally generated content. We further discuss how ACW represents an underexplored class of interactive systems, i.e., proximity interaction on wall-sized interactive surfaces, which presents novel human-computer interaction challenges.","

The article highlights the potential for Augmented/Virtual Reality technology to increase diversity of movement and challenges in sports, but it also raises concerns about the impact of digital augmentation on the traditional nature of sports. The article notes that the use of technology in sports can lead to a loss of the traditional physical and mental challenges that are inherent in sports, and that the reliance on technology can create a sense of detachment from the physical activity. Additionally, the article mentions that the use of technology in sports can create a sense of unevenness, where some participants have access to advanced technology while others do not. This could lead to a lack of fairness and equality in sports, and could potentially undermine the integrity of the game.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858450,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Pmomo: Projection Mapping on Movable 3D Object,"We introduce Pmomo (acronym of projection mapping on movable object), a dynamic projection mapping system that tracks the 6-DOF position of real-world object, and shades it with virtual 3D contents by projection. The system can precisely lock the projection on the moving object in real-time, even the one with complex geometry. Based on depth camera, we developed a novel and robust tracking method that samples the structure of the object into low-density point cloud, then performs an adaptive searching scheme for the registration procedure. As a fully interactive system, our method can handle both internal and external complex occlusions, and can quickly track back the object even when losing track. In order to further improve the realism of the projected virtual textures, our system innovatively culls occlusions away from projection, which is achieved by a facet-covering method. As a result, the Pmomo system enables the possibility of new interactive Augmented Reality applications that require high-quality dynamic projection effect.","

The Pmomo system, while impressive in its ability to project virtual 3D content onto moving objects, raises concerns about privacy and surveillance. With its ability to track the 6-DOF position of real-world objects and sample the structure of objects into low-density point clouds, the system could potentially be used to monitor and track individuals without their knowledge or consent. This could lead to a loss of privacy and potentially dangerous situations, especially if the technology falls into the wrong hands. Additionally, the system's ability to cull occlusions away from projection could potentially be used to create fake or manipulated visual representations, further blurring the lines between reality and virtual reality.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858329,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Simplified Audio Production in Asynchronous Voice-Based Discussions,"Voice communication adds nuance and expressivity to virtual discussions, but its one-shot nature tends to discourage collaborators from utilizing it. However, text-based interfaces have made voice editing much easier, especially with recent advancements enabling live, time-aligned speech transcription. We introduce SimpleSpeech, an easy-to-use platform for asynchronous audio communication (AAC) with lightweight tools for inserting content, adjusting pauses, and correcting transcript errors. Qualitative and quantitative results suggest that novice audio producers, such as high school students, experience decreased mental workload when using SimpleSpeech to produce audio messages than without editing. The linguistic formality in SimpleSpeech messages was also studied, and found to form a middle ground between oral and written media. Our findings on editable voice messages show new implications for the optimal design and use cases of AAC systems.","

"""Popcorn Tastes Good"": Participatory Policymaking and Reddit's","In human-computer interaction research and practice, policy concerns can sometimes fall to the margins, orbiting at the periphery of the traditionally core interests of design and practice. This perspective ignores the important ways that policy is bound up with the technical and behavioral elements of the HCI universe. Policy concerns are triggered as a matter of course in social computing, CSCW, systems engineering, UX, and related contexts because technological design, social practice and policy are dynamically entangled and mutually constitutive. Through this research, we demonstrate the value of a stronger emphasis on policy in HCI by exploring a recent controversy on Reddit: ""AMAgeddon."" Applying Hirschman's exit, voice and loyalty framework, we argue that the sustainability of online communities like Reddit will require successful navigation of the complex and often murky intersections among technical design and human interaction through a distributed participatory policymaking process that promotes user loyalty.","Social Media platforms like Reddit can lead to controversies and issues that are difficult to resolve, threatening the sustainability of online communities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858516,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Going Dark: Social Factors in Collective Action Against Platform Operators in the Reddit Blackout,"This paper describes how people who lead communities on online platforms join together in mass collective action to influence platform operators. I investigate this by analyzing a protest against the social news platform reddit by moderators of 2,278 subreddit communities in July 2015. These moderators collectively disabled their subreddits, preventing millions of readers from accessing major parts of reddit and convincing the company to negotiate over their demands. This paper offers a descriptive analysis of the protest, combining qualitative content analysis, interviews, and quantitative analysis with the population of 52,735 active subreddits. Through participatory hypotheses testing with moderators, this study reveals social factors including the grievances of moderators, relations with platform operators, relations among moderators, subreddit resources, subreddit isolation, and moderators' relations with their subreddits that can lead to participation in mass collective action against a platform.","Social media platforms can be used to organize mass collective action against platform operators, leading to potential disruptions and negative impacts on the platform and its users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858391,Social Media,CHI,politics
"Surviving an ""Eternal September"": How an Online Community Managed a Surge of Newcomers","We present a qualitative analysis of interviews with participants in the NoSleep community within Reddit where millions of fans and writers of horror fiction congregate. We explore how the community handled a massive, sudden, and sustained increase in new members. Although existing theory and stories like Usenet's infamous ""Eternal September"" suggest that large influxes of newcomers can hurt online communities, our interviews suggest that NoSleep survived without major incident. We propose that three features of NoSleep allowed it to manage the rapid influx of newcomers gracefully: (1) an active and well-coordinated group of administrators, (2) a shared sense of community which facilitated community moderation, and (3) technological systems that mitigated norm violations.

"""This Post Will Just Get Taken Down"": Characterizing Removed Pro-Eating Disorder Social Media Content","Social media sites like Facebook and Instagram remove content that is against community guidelines or is perceived to be deviant behavior. Users also delete their own content that they feel is not appropriate within personal or community norms. In this paper, we examine characteristics of over 30,000 pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) posts that were at one point public on Instagram but have since been removed. Our work shows that straightforward signals can be found in deleted content that distinguish them from other posts, and that the implications of such classification are immense. We build a classifier that compares public pro-ED posts with this removed content that achieves moderate accuracy of 69%. We also analyze the characteristics in content in each of these post categories and find that removed content reflects more dangerous actions, self-harm tendencies, and vulnerability than posts that remain public. Our work provides early insights into content removal in a sensitive community and addresses the future research implications of the findings.","Social media platforms removing content that promotes unhealthy behaviors, such as pro-eating disorder posts, can have a negative impact on individuals who are struggling with these issues.

We describe how this record was captured and flexibly mapped to the physical guitar and proxy artefacts. We contribute a conceptual framework for accountable artefacts that articulates how multiple and complex mappings between physical artefacts and their digital records may be created, appropriated, shared and interrogated to deliver accounts of provenance and use as well as methodological reflections on technology probes.","

* Loss of privacy: The use of technology probes to track the location, interactions, and experiences of physical artefacts raises concerns about privacy and surveillance.

Novel Optical Configurations for Virtual Reality: Evaluating User Preference and Performance with Focus-tunable and Monovision Near-eye Displays,"Emerging virtual reality (VR) displays must overcome the prevalent issue of visual discomfort to provide high-quality and immersive user experiences. In particular, the mismatch between vergence and accommodation cues inherent to most stereoscopic displays has been a long standing challenge. In this paper, we evaluate several adaptive display modes afforded by focus-tunable optics or actuated displays that have the promise to mitigate visual discomfort caused by the vergence-accommodation conflict, and improve performance in VR environments. We also explore monovision as an unconventional mode that allows each eye of an observer to accommodate to a different distance. While this technique is common practice in ophthalmology, we are the first to report its effectiveness for VR applications with a custom built set up.

Augmenting the Field-of-View of Head-Mounted Displays with Sparse Peripheral Displays,"In this paper, we explore the concept of a sparse peripheral display, which augments the field-of-view of a head-mounted display with a lightweight, low-resolution, inexpensively produced array of LEDs surrounding the central high-resolution display. We show that sparse peripheral displays expand the available field-of-view up to 190º horizontal, nearly filling the human field-of-view. We prototyped two proof-of-concept implementations of sparse peripheral displays: a virtual reality headset, dubbed SparseLightVR, and an augmented reality headset, called SparseLightAR. Using SparseLightVR, we conducted a user study to evaluate the utility of our implementation, and a second user study to assess different visualization schemes in the periphery and their effect on simulator sickness. Our findings show that sparse peripheral displays are useful in conveying peripheral information and improving situational awareness, are generally preferred, and can help reduce motion sickness in nausea-susceptible people.","

SnapToReality: Aligning Augmented Reality to the Real World,"Augmented Reality (AR) applications may require the precise alignment of virtual objects to the real world. We propose automatic alignment of virtual objects to physical constraints calculated from the real world in real time (""snapping to reality""). We demonstrate SnapToReality alignment techniques that allow users to position, rotate, and scale virtual content to dynamic, real world scenes. Our proof-of-concept prototype extracts 3D edge and planar surface constraints. We furthermore discuss the unique design challenges of snapping in AR, including the user's limited field of view, noise in constraint extraction, issues with changing the view in AR, visualizing constraints, and more. We also report the results of a user study evaluating SnapToReality, confirming that aligning objects to the real world is significantly faster when assisted by snapping to dynamically extracted constraints. Perhaps more importantly, we also found that snapping in AR enables a fresh and expressive form of AR content creation.","

The use of Augmented Reality technology can lead to a decrease in the ability to perceive reality accurately, as users may become too reliant on virtual objects and constraints, leading to a blurring of the lines between the physical and virtual worlds.

Virtual Objects as Spatial Cues in Collaborative Mixed Reality Environments: How They Shape Communication Behavior and User Task Load,"In collaborative activities, collaborators can use physical objects in their shared environment as spatial cues to guide each other's attention. Collaborative mixed reality environments (MREs) include both, physical and digital objects. To study how virtual objects influence collaboration and whether they are used as spatial cues, we conducted a controlled lab experiment with 16 dyads. Results of our study show that collaborators favored the digital objects as spatial cues over the physical environment and the physical objects: Collaborators used significantly less deictic gestures in favor of more disambiguous verbal references and a decreased subjective workload when virtual objects were present. This suggests adding additional virtual objects as spatial cues to MREs to improve user experience during collaborative mixed reality tasks.","

The study suggests that people collaborating in mixed reality environments may rely more heavily on virtual objects as spatial cues, rather than physical objects or gestures, which could lead to a decrease in nonverbal communication and social interaction skills.

VR-STEP: Walking-in-Place using Inertial Sensing for Hands Free Navigation in Mobile VR Environments,"Low-cost smartphone adapters can bring virtual reality to the masses, but input is typically limited to using head tracking, which makes it difficult to perform complex tasks like navigation. Walking-in-place (WIP) offers a natural and immersive form of virtual locomotion that can reduce simulation sickness. WIP, however, is difficult to implement in mobile contexts as it typically relies on bulky controllers or an external camera. We present VR-STEP; a WIP implementation that uses real-time pedometry to implement virtual locomotion. VR-STEP requires no additional instrumentation outside of a smartphone's inertial sensors. A user study with 18 users compares VR-STEP with a commonly used auto-walk navigation method and finds no significant difference in performance or reliability, though VR-STEP was found to be more immersive and intuitive.","

"""Will I always be not social?"": Re-Conceptualizing Sociality in the Context of a Minecraft Community for Autism","Traditional face-to-face social interactions can be challenging for individuals with autism, leading some to perceive and categorize them as less social than their typically-developing peers. Individuals with autism may even see themselves as less social relative to their peers. Online communities can provide an alternative venue for social expression, enabling different types of communication beyond face-to-face, oral interaction. Using ethnographic methods, we studied the communication ecology that has emerged around a Minecraft server for children with autism and their allies. Our analysis shows how members of this community search for, practice, and define sociality through a variety of communication channels.

SkullConduct: Biometric User Identification on Eyewear Computers Using Bone Conduction Through the Skull,"Secure user identification is important for the increasing number of eyewear computers but limited input capabilities pose significant usability challenges for established knowledge-based schemes, such as passwords or PINs. We present SkullConduct, a biometric system that uses bone conduction of sound through the user's skull as well as a microphone readily integrated into many of these devices, such as Google Glass. At the core of SkullConduct is a method to analyze the characteristic frequency response created by the user's skull using a combination of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features as well as a computationally light-weight 1NN classifier. We report on a controlled experiment with 10 participants that shows that this frequency response is person-specific and stable -- even when taking off and putting on the device multiple times -- and thus serves as a robust biometric. We show that our method can identify users with 97.0% accuracy and authenticate them with an equal error rate of 6.9%, thereby bringing biometric user identification to eyewear computers equipped with bone conduction technology.","

The use of bone conduction technology for biometric identification in eyewear computers may lead to privacy concerns, as it can potentially be used to track individuals without their knowledge or consent. This technology could be used to monitor a person's movements, activities, and location, and could potentially be exploited by hackers or government agencies to gather sensitive information. Additionally, the use of a person's skull as a biometric identifier raises ethical questions about the ownership and control of one's own body data.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858152,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Finexus: Tracking Precise Motions of Multiple Fingertips Using Magnetic Sensing,"With the resurgence of head-mounted displays for virtual reality, users need new input devices that can accurately track their hands and fingers in motion. We introduce Finexus, a multipoint tracking system using magnetic field sensing. By instrumenting the fingertips with electromagnets, the system can track fine fingertip movements in real time using only four magnetic sensors. To keep the system robust to noise, we operate each electromagnet at a different frequency and leverage bandpass filters to distinguish signals attributed to individual sensing points.

Head Mounted Projection Display & Visual Attention: Visual Attentional Processing of Head Referenced Static and Dynamic Displays while in Motion and Standing,"The Head Mounted Projection Display (HMPD) is a growing interest area in HCI. Although various aspects of HMPDs have been investigated, there is not enough information regarding the effect of HMPDs (i.e., head referenced static and dynamic displays while a user is in motion and standing) on visual attentional performance. For this purpose, we conducted a user study (N=18) with three experimental conditions (control, standing, walking) and two visual perceptual tasks (with dynamic and static displays). Significant differences between conditions were only found for the task with dynamic display; accuracy was lower in walking condition compared to the other two conditions. Our work contributes an empirical investigation of the effect of HMPDs on visual attentional performance by providing data-driven benchmarks for developing graphical user interface design guidelines for HMPDs.","

Using Head Mounted Projection Display (HMPD) can decrease visual attentional performance, especially when the user is walking. This can lead to a decrease in accuracy and an increase in mistakes.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858449,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Stabilized Annotations for Mobile Remote Assistance,"Recent mobile technology has provided new opportunities for creating remote assistance systems. However, mobile support systems present a particular challenge: both the camera and display are held by the user, leading to shaky video. When pointing or drawing annotations, this means that the desired target often moves, causing the gesture to lose its intended meaning. To address this problem, we investigate annotation stabilization techniques, which allow annotations to stick to their intended location. We studied two annotation systems, using three different forms of annotations, with both tablets and head-mounted displays. Our analysis suggests that stabilized annotations and head-mounted displays are only beneficial in certain situations. However, the simplest approach of automatically freezing video while drawing annotations was surprisingly effective in facilitating the completion of remote assistance tasks.",Shaky video and loss of intended meaning of gestures when using mobile devices for remote assistance systems.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858171,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Parallel Eyes: Exploring Human Capability and Behaviors with Paralleled First Person View Sharing,"Our research explores how humans can understand and develop viewing behaviors with mutual paralleled first person view sharing in which a person can see others' first person video perspectives as well as their own perspective in realtime. We developed a paralleled first person view sharing system which consists of multiple video see-through head mounted displays and an embedded eye tracking system. With this system, four persons can see four shared first person videos of each other. We then conducted workshop based research with two activities, drawing pictures and playing a simple chasing game with our view sharing system. Our results show that 1) people can complement each other's memory and decisions and 2) people can develop their viewing behaviors to understand their own physical embodiment and spatial relationship with others in complex situations. Our findings about patterns of viewing behavior and design implications will contribute to building design experience in paralleled view sharing applications.","

Gaze Augmentation in Egocentric Video Improves Awareness of Intention,"Video communication using head-mounted cameras could be useful to mediate shared activities and support collaboration. Growing popularity of wearable gaze trackers presents an opportunity to add gaze information on the egocentric video. We hypothesized three potential benefits of gaze-augmented egocentric video to support collaborative scenarios: support deictic referencing, enable grounding in communication, and enable better awareness of the collaborator's intentions. Previous research on using egocentric videos for real-world collaborative tasks has failed to show clear benefits of gaze point visualization. We designed a study, deconstructing a collaborative car navigation scenario, to specifically target the value of gaze-augmented video for intention prediction. Our results show that viewers of gaze-augmented video could predict the direction taken by a driver at a four-way intersection more accurately and more confidently than a viewer of the same video without the superimposed gaze point. Our study demonstrates that gaze augmentation can be useful and encourages further study in real-world collaborative scenarios.","

The use of gaze-augmented video in collaborative scenarios may lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication and social skills, as people rely more on technology and less on human interaction. This could result in a loss of nonverbal cues and social nuances that are important for effective communication and building relationships. Additionally, the use of gaze tracking technology may raise privacy concerns, as it can potentially be used to monitor and track individuals' eye movements without their consent.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858127,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Hosting via Airbnb: Motivations and Financial Assurances in Monetized Network Hospitality,"We examine how financial assurance structures and the clearly defined financial transaction at the core of monetized network hospitality reduce uncertainty for Airbnb hosts and guests. We apply the principles of social exchange and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to a qualitative study of Airbnb hosts to 1) describe activities that are facilitated by the peer-to-peer exchange platform and 2) how the assurance of the initial financial exchange facilitates additional social exchanges between hosts and guests. The study illustrates that the financial benefits of hosting do not necessarily crowd out intrinsic motivations for hosting but instead strengthen them and even act as a gateway to further social exchange and interpersonal interaction. We describe the assurance structures in networked peer-to-peer exchange, and explain how such assurances can reconcile contention between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. We conclude with implications for design and future research.","Social Media platforms like Airbnb can create a reliance on financial transactions, potentially crowding out intrinsic motivations for hosting and reducing the authenticity of interpersonal interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858092,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Digitally Augmenting Sports: An Opportunity for Exploring and Understanding Novel Balancing Techniques,"Using game balancing techniques can provide the right level of challenge and hence enhance player engagement for sport players with different skill levels. Digital technology can support and enhance balancing techniques in sports, for example, by adjusting players' level of intensity based on their heart rate. However, there is limited knowledge on how to design such balancing and its impact on the user experience. To address this we created two novel balancing techniques enabled by digitally augmenting a table tennis table. We adjusted the more skilled player's performance by inducing two different styles of play and studied the effects on game balancing and player engagement. We showed that by altering the more skilled player's performance we can balance the game through: (i) encouraging game mistakes, and (ii) changing the style of play to one that is easier for the opponent to counteract. We outline the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, extending our understanding of game balancing design. We also show that digitally augmenting sports offers opportunities for novel balancing techniques while facilitating engaging experiences, guiding those interested in HCI and sports.","

The use of digital technology to balance gameplay in sports can lead to an uneven playing field, where one player is given an unfair advantage or disadvantage. This can result in a lack of fairness and potentially discourage players from participating in the game. Additionally, the use of technology to alter a player's performance can be seen as an invasion of their autonomy and agency, taking away their ability to control their own gameplay experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858277,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
SwimTrain: Exploring Exergame Design for Group Fitness Swimming,"We explore design opportunities for using interactive technologies to enrich group fitness exercises, such as group spinning and swimming, in which an instructor guides a workout program and members synchronously perform a shared physical activity. As a case study, we investigate group fitness swimming. The design challenge is to coordinate a large group of people by considering trade-offs between social awareness and information overload. Our resulting group fitness swimming game, SwimTrain, allows a group of people to have localized synchronous interactions over a virtual space. The game uses competitive and cooperative phases to help group members acquire group-wide awareness. The results of our user study showed that SwimTrain provides socially-enriched swimming experiences, motivates swimmers to follow a training regimen and exert more intensely, and allows strategic game play dealing with skill differences among swimmers. Consequently, we propose several practical considerations for designing group fitness exergames.",Overload of information and decreased social awareness.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858579,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,access to information & discourse
'Don't Waste My Time': Use of Time Information Improves Focus,"Maintaining work focus when on a computer is a major challenge, and people often feel that they use their time ineffectively. To improve focus we designed meTime, a real-time awareness application that shows users how they allocate their time across applications. In two real-world deployments involving 118 participants, we examined whether greater awareness of time use improves focus. In our first deployment, we provided awareness information using meTime, to both office workers and students. Exposure to meTime reduced use of social media, email, browsing and total time online. However increased awareness didn't affect time spent in productivity applications. A second educational deployment largely replicated these results and showed that meTime also reduced users' perceptions of their ability to focus effectively. Changed perceptions were associated with higher class grades. We discuss practical and theoretical implications as well as design principles for use of time applications.",Social Media technology can distract people from their work and reduce their productivity.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858193,Social Media,CHI,user experience
On Looking at the Vagina through Labella,"Women's understandings of their own intimate anatomy has been identified as critical to women's reproductive health and sexual wellbeing. However, talking about it, seeking medical help when necessary as well as examining oneself in order to 'know' oneself is complicated by social-cultural constructions of the vagina, i.e. it is something private, shameful and not to be talked about. In response to this, we designed Labella, an augmented system that supports intimate bodily knowledge and pelvic fitness in women. It combines a pair of underwear and a mobile phone as a tool for embodied intimate self-discovery. In this paper, we describe Labella, and its evaluation with fourteen women, aged 25-63. We show how through situated embodied perception Labella empowers 'looking'. We highlight how the simple act of augmented looking enables the construction of knowledge which ranges from establishing the 'very basics' through to a nuanced understanding of pelvic muscle structure. Finally, we highlight the role of awkwardness and humour in the design of interactions to overcome taboo.","
The use of augmented reality technology in the form of Labella, an augmented system that supports intimate bodily knowledge and pelvic fitness in women, may perpetuate the stigma and shame associated with women's bodies and their sexual health. By using a mobile phone and underwear as tools for ""embodied intimate self-discovery,"" the technology may reinforce the idea that women's bodies are inherently private and shameful, and that discussing them is taboo. This could potentially discourage women from seeking medical help or discussing their bodies with healthcare professionals, leading to negative consequences for their reproductive health and wellbeing.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858119,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Annexing Reality: Enabling Opportunistic Use of Everyday Objects as Tangible Proxies in Augmented Reality,"Advances in display and tracking technologies hold the promise of increasingly immersive augmented-reality experiences. Unfortunately, the on-demand generation of haptic experiences is lagging behind these advances in other feedback channels. We present Annexing Reality; a system that opportunistically annexes physical objects from a user's current physical environment to provide the best-available haptic sensation for virtual objects. It allows content creators to a priori specify haptic experiences that adapt to the user's current setting. The system continuously scans user's surrounding, selects physical objects that are similar to given virtual objects, and overlays the virtual models on to selected physical ones reducing the visual-haptic mismatch. We describe the developer's experience with the Annexing Reality system and the techniques utilized in realizing it. We also present results of a developer study that validates the usability and utility of our method of defining haptic experiences.","

The technology can take over physical objects in a user's environment without their knowledge or consent, potentially leading to a loss of privacy and control over their own surroundings. This could result in a sense of disorientation and discomfort, as well as the potential for misuse by content creators or hackers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858134,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Haptic Retargeting: Dynamic Repurposing of Passive Haptics for Enhanced Virtual Reality Experiences,"Manipulating a virtual object with appropriate passive haptic cues provides a satisfying sense of presence in virtual reality. However, scaling such experiences to support multiple virtual objects is a challenge as each one needs to be accompanied with a precisely-located haptic proxy object. We propose a solution that overcomes this limitation by hacking human perception. We have created a framework for repurposing passive haptics, called haptic retargeting, that leverages the dominance of vision when our senses conflict. With haptic retargeting, a single physical prop can provide passive haptics for multiple virtual objects. We introduce three approaches for dynamically aligning physical and virtual objects: world manipulation, body manipulation and a hybrid technique which combines both world and body manipulation. Our study results indicate that all our haptic retargeting techniques improve the sense of presence when compared to typical wand-based 3D control of virtual objects. Furthermore, our hybrid haptic retargeting achieved the highest satisfaction and presence scores while limiting the visible side-effects during interaction.","

The use of haptic retargeting in virtual reality can lead to a decrease in the user's ability to distinguish between the physical and virtual worlds, potentially causing confusion and disorientation. The manipulation of passive haptics can also create a false sense of presence, leading users to believe they are interacting with real objects when they are not. This can have negative consequences in situations where the user needs to interact with real objects in the physical world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858226,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
HaptoClone (Haptic-Optical Clone) for Mutual Tele-Environment by Real-time 3D Image Transfer with Midair Force Feedback,"In this paper, we propose a novel interactive system that mutually copies adjacent 3D environments optically and physically. The system realizes mutual user interactions through haptics without wearing any devices. A realistic volumetric image is displayed using a pair of micro-mirror array plates (MMAPs). The MMAP transmissively reflects the rays from an object, and a pair of them reconstructs the floating aerial image of the object. Our system can optically copy adjacent environments based on this technology. Haptic feedback is also given by using an airborne ultrasound tactile display (AUTD). Converged ultrasound can give force feedback in midair. Based on the optical characteristics of the MMAPs, the cloned image and the user share an identical coordinate system. When a user touches the transferred clone image, the system gives force feedback so that the user can feel the mechanical contact and reality of the floating image.","Users may become detached from reality as they interact with virtual objects and environments that feel real, leading to decreased social skills and ability to interact with the physical world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858481,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Dexmo: An Inexpensive and Lightweight Mechanical Exoskeleton for Motion Capture and Force Feedback in VR,"We present Dexmo: an inexpensive and lightweight mechanical exoskeleton system for motion capturing and force feedback in virtual reality applications. Dexmo combines multiple types of sensors, actuation units and link rod structures to provide users with a pleasant virtual reality experience. The device tracks the user's motion and uniquely provides passive force feedback. In combination with a 3D graphics rendered environment, Dexmo provides the user with a realistic sensation of interaction when a user is for example grasping an object. An initial evaluation with 20 participants demonstrate that the device is working reliably and that the addition of force feedback resulted in a significant reduction in error rate. Informal comments by the participants were overwhelmingly positive.","

The device can provide users with a realistic sensation of interaction, but it can also create a false sense of reality, leading to a decrease in the ability to differentiate between the virtual and real world. This can result in a decrease in the ability to interact with the real world and an increase in the reliance on technology, leading to a decrease in human abilities and social skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858487,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
SwiVRChair: A Motorized Swivel Chair to Nudge Users' Orientation for 360 Degree Storytelling in Virtual Reality,"We present SwiVRChair, a motorized swivel chair to nudge users' orientation in 360 degree storytelling scenarios. Since rotating a scene in virtual reality (VR) leads to simulator sickness, storytellers currently have no way of controlling users' attention. SwiVRChair allows creators of 360 degree VR movie content to be able to rotate or block users' movement to either show certain content or prevent users from seeing something. To enable this functionality, we modified a regular swivel chair using a 24V DC motor and an electromagnetic clutch. We developed two demo scenarios using both mechanisms (rotate and block) for the Samsung GearVR and conducted a user study (n=16) evaluating the presence, enjoyment and simulator sickness for participants using SwiVRChair compared to self control (Foot Control). Users rated the experience using SwiVRChair to be significantly more immersive and enjoyable whilst having a decrease in simulator sickness.",Simulator sickness.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858040,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Gamer Style: Performance Factors in Gamified Simulation,"Serious games and gamified simulations are increasingly being used to aid instruction in technical disciplines including the medical field. Assessments of player performance are important in understanding user profiles in order to establish serious games as a reliable, consistent method for increasing skills and competence in all trainees. In this study we used questionnaires, game characteristic metrics and EEG analysis to explore players' performance in a bronchoscopy simulator. We found that players who performed better were younger, made fewer errors, were quicker and differed in spectral profile during game play. Our findings, while speculative, have implications for training regimes in which gamified simulations are employed. We make suggestions for game design and for tailoring training regimes to suit individual learning styles to enhance knowledge acquisition and retention.","Over-reliance on technology and neglect of human interaction in learning.

Discovering Shifts to Suicidal Ideation from Mental Health Content in Social Media,"History of mental illness is a major factor behind suicide risk and ideation. However research efforts toward characterizing and forecasting this risk is limited due to the paucity of information regarding suicide ideation, exacerbated by the stigma of mental illness. This paper fills gaps in the literature by developing a statistical methodology to infer which individuals could undergo transitions from mental health discourse to suicidal ideation. We utilize semi-anonymous support communities on Reddit as unobtrusive data sources to infer the likelihood of these shifts. We develop language and interactional measures for this purpose, as well as a propensity score matching based statistical approach. Our approach allows us to derive distinct markers of shifts to suicidal ideation. These markers can be modeled in a prediction framework to identify individuals likely to engage in suicidal ideation in the future. We discuss societal and ethical implications of this research.","Social media platforms like Reddit can be used to identify individuals who may be at risk of suicidal ideation, but this also raises concerns about privacy and stigma.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858207,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Recovery Amid Pro-Anorexia: Analysis of Recovery in Social Media,"Online communities can promote illness recovery and improve well-being in the cases of many kinds of illnesses. However, for challenging mental health condition like anorexia, social media harbor both recovery communities as well as those that encourage dangerous behaviors. The effectiveness of such platforms in promoting recovery despite housing both communities is underexplored. Our work begins to fill this gap by developing a statistical framework using survival analysis and situating our results within the cognitive behavioral theory of anorexia. This model identifies content and participation measures that predict the likelihood of recovery. From our dataset of over 68M posts and 10K users that self-identify with anorexia, we find that recovery on Tumblr is protracted - only half of the population is estimated to exhibit signs of recovery after four years. We discuss the effectiveness of social media in improving well-being around anorexia, a unique health challenge, and emergent questions from this line of work.","Social media can harbor communities that encourage dangerous behaviors, such as anorexia, and hinder recovery despite housing recovery communities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858246,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
"Do That, There: An Interaction Technique for Addressing In-Air Gesture Systems","When users want to interact with an in-air gesture system, they must first address it. This involves finding where to gesture so that their actions can be sensed, and how to direct their input towards that system so that they do not also affect others or cause unwanted effects. This is an important problem which lacks a practical solution. We present an interaction technique which uses multimodal feedback to help users address in-air gesture systems. The feedback tells them how (""do that"") and where (""there"") to gesture, using light, audio and tactile displays. By doing that there, users can direct their input to the system they wish to interact with, in a place where their gestures can be sensed. We discuss the design of our technique and three experiments investigating its use, finding that users can ""do that"" well (93.2%-99.9%) while accurately (51mm-80mm) and quickly (3.7s) finding ""there"".","Users may struggle to effectively interact with in-air gesture systems, leading to confusion and frustration.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858308,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Proactive Sensing for Improving Hand Pose Estimation,We propose a novel sensing technique called proactive sensing. Proactive sensing continually repositions a camera-based sensor as a way to improve hand pose estimation. Our core contribution is a scheme that effectively learns how to move the sensor to improve pose estimation confidence while requiring no ground truth hand poses. We demonstrate this concept using a low-cost rapid swing arm system built around the state-of-the-art commercial sensing system Leap Motion. The results from our user study show that proactive sensing helps estimate users' hand poses with higher confidence compared to both static and random sensing. We further present an online model update to improve performance for each user.,"

The development of proactive sensing technology, which continually repositions a camera-based sensor to improve hand pose estimation, may lead to increased reliance on technology and decreased manual dexterity. As people rely more on technology to accurately sense their hand movements, they may neglect their natural hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills, leading to a decline in manual dexterity and potentially negative impacts on cognitive development.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858587,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"First I ""like"" it, then I hide it: Folk Theories of Social Feeds","Many online platforms use curation algorithms that are opaque to the user. Recent work suggests that discovering a filtering algorithm's existence in a curated feed influences user experience, but it remains unclear how users reason about the operation of these algorithms. In this qualitative laboratory study, researchers interviewed a diverse, non-probability sample of 40 Facebook users before, during, and after being presented alternative displays of Facebook's News Feed curation algorithm's output. Interviews revealed 10 ""folk theories' of automated curation, some quite unexpected. Users who were given a probe into the algorithm's operation via an interface that incorporated ""seams,' visible hints disclosing aspects of automation operations, could quickly develop theories. Users made plans that depended on their theories. We conclude that foregrounding these automated processes may increase interface design complexity, but it may also add usability benefits.","Social media platforms' algorithms are often opaque to users, which can lead to misunderstandings and misconceptions about how the algorithms work and how they curate content. This can result in users developing ""folk theories"" about the algorithms' operations, which may not be accurate and can lead to unintended consequences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858494,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Accounting for Taste: Ranking Curators and Content in Social Networks,"Ranking users in social networks is a well-studied problem, typically solved by algorithms that leverage network structure to identify influential users and recommend people to follow. In the last decade, however, curation --- users sharing and promoting content in a network --- has become a central social activity, as platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and GitHub drive growth and engagement by connecting users through content and content to users. While existing algorithms reward users that are highly active with higher rankings, they fail to account for users' curatorial taste. This paper introduces CuRank, an algorithm for ranking users and content in social networks by explicitly modeling three characteristics of a good curator: discerning taste, high activity, and timeliness. We evaluate CuRank on datasets from two popular social networks --- GitHub and Vine --- and demonstrate its efficacy at ranking content and identifying good curators.","Social media platforms prioritize growth and engagement over quality content, leading to an oversaturation of low-quality content and the suppression of meaningful interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858219,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Communities Found by Users -- not Algorithms: Comparing Human and Algorithmically Generated Communities,"Many algorithms have been created to automatically detect community structures in social networks. These algorithms have been studied from the perspective of optimisation extensively. However, which community finding algorithm most closely matches the human notion of communities? In this paper, we conduct a user study to address this question. In our experiment, users collected their own Facebook network and manually annotated it, indicating their social communities. Given this annotation, we run state-of-the-art community finding algorithms on the network and use Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) to compare annotated communities with automatically detected ones. Our results show that the Infomap algorithm has the greatest similarity to user defined communities, with Girvan-Newman and Louvain algorithms also performing well.","

Hashtag Drift: Tracing the Evolving Uses of Political Hashtags Over Time,"Sociologists and political scientists have drawn attention to the importance of hashtags as tools for political organizing and protest online. Examining a set of political hashtags on Tumblr, we discover linguistic changes in the ways that the hashtags are used over time. As time passes, the community uses a more diverse vocabulary of hashtags in conjunction with the central political tag, suggesting that the meaning of the tag expands or proliferates -- a phenomenon we dub hashtag drift. We also find evidence that this occurs not just on the level of the community but at the level of individual users who, as time progresses, use the hashtag in conjunction with a more diverse vocabulary of other tags. This study sheds light on the dynamics of political engagement through hashtag activism.","Hashtag activism can lead to a dilution of the original message or cause, as the meaning of the hashtag expands or proliferates over time.

Supporting Opportunities for Context-Aware Social Matching: An Experience Sampling Study,"Mobile social matching systems aim to bring people together in the physical world by recommending people nearby to each other. Going beyond simple similarity and proximity matching mechanisms, we explore a proposed framework of relational, social and personal context as predictors of match opportunities to map out the design space of opportunistic social matching systems. We contribute insights gained from a study combining Experience Sampling Method (ESM) with 85 students of a U.S. university and interviews with 15 of these participants. A generalized linear mixed model analysis (n=1704) showed that personal context (mood and busyness) as well as sociability of others nearby are the strongest predictors of contextual match interest. Participant interviews suggest operationalizing relational context using social network rarity and discoverable rarity, and incorporating skill level and learning/teaching needs for activity partnering. Based on these findings we propose passive context-awareness for opportunistic social matching.","

Social Media technology can lead to a decrease in meaningful, in-person interactions and a reliance on technology to facilitate social connections.

Transition Resilience with ICTs: 'Identity Awareness' in Veteran Re-Integration,"This paper reports on a qualitative interview study of ICT use amongst a population undergoing transition following a life disruption. We interviewed 13 veterans who were re-integrating into civil society. Veterans are unique in that they experience several transitions at once-that is, after returning home, they often suffer from PTSD, become homeless, change occupations, etc. Amongst other things, veterans often undergo identity crises as caused by the lack of continuity between military and civilian social structures. We show how veterans are resilient through their uses of ICTs when navigating identity crises. We find that they use ICTs to develop identity awareness-that is, they connect with a human infrastructure through which they can develop a ""big picture"" understanding of unfamiliar rules and norms and receive support when navigating civil society. We discuss the implications of our study and identify implications for design.","Social Media can contribute to identity crises and disrupt the reintegration of veterans into civil society, particularly when they experience a lack of continuity between military and civilian social structures.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858109,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Digital Footprints and Changing Networks During Online Identity Transitions,"Digital artifacts on social media can challenge individuals during identity transitions, particularly those who prefer to delete, separate from, or hide data that are representative of a past identity. This work investigates concerns and practices reported by transgender people who transitioned while active on Facebook. We analyze open-ended survey responses from 283 participants, highlighting types of data considered problematic when separating oneself from a past identity, and challenges and strategies people engage in when managing personal data in a networked environment. We find that people shape their digital footprints in two ways: by editing the self-presentational data that is representative of a prior identity, and by managing the configuration of people who have access to that self-presentation. We outline the challenging interplay between shifting identities, social networks, and the data that suture them together. We apply these results to a discussion of the complexities of managing and forgetting the digital past.","Social media can make it difficult for people to move on from their past identities, as their digital artifacts can be problematic to delete, separate or hide, especially for transgender people who transitioned while active on Facebook.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858136,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Legacy Contact: Designing and Implementing Post-mortem Stewardship at Facebook,"Post-mortem profiles on social network sites serve as both an archive of the deceased person's life and a gathering place for friends and loved ones. Many existing systems utilize inheritance as a model for post-mortem data management. However, the social and networked nature of personal data on social media, as well as the memorializing practices in which friends engage, indicate that other approaches are necessary. In this paper, we articulate the design choices made throughout the development of Legacy Contact, a post-mortem data management solution designed and deployed at Facebook. Building on the duties and responsibilities identified by Brubaker et al., we describe how Legacy Contact was designed to honor last requests, provide information surrounding death, preserve the memory of the deceased, and facilitate memorializing practices. We provide details around the design of the Legacy Contact selection process, the functionality provided to legacy contacts after accounts have been memorialized, and changes made to post-mortem profiles.","

The article discusses the challenges of managing personal data on social media after a user's death, highlighting the need for a solution that honors the deceased's last requests, provides information surrounding their death, preserves their memory, and facilitates memorializing practices. However, the existing approaches, such as inheritance, may not be suitable for post-mortem data management due to the social and networked nature of personal data on social media. This implies that the current management of post-mortem data may not be adequate, potentially leading to undesirable consequences such as privacy violations, misuse of personal data, or inappropriate memorialization.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858254,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
What is Your Organization 'Like'?: A Study of Liking Activity in the Enterprise,"The 'like' button, introduced by Facebook several years ago, has become one of the most prominent icons of social media. Similarly to other popular social media features on the web, enterprises have also recently adopted it. In this paper, we present a first comprehensive study of liking activity in the enterprise. We studied the logs of an enterprise social media platform within a large global organization along a period of seven months, in which 393,720 'likes' were performed. In addition, we conducted a survey of 571 users of the platform's 'like' button. Our evaluation combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to inspect what employees like, why they use the 'like' button, and to whom they give their 'likes'.",People are becoming too obsessed with likes and it's affecting their self-esteem and mental health.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858540,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Towards Providing On-Demand Expert Support for Software Developers,"Software development is an expert task that requires complex reasoning and the ability to recall language or API-specific details. In practice, developers often seek support from IDE tools, Web resources, or other developers to help fill in gaps in their knowledge on-demand. In this paper, we present two studies that seek to inform the design of future systems that use remote experts to support developers on demand. The first explores what types of questions developers would ask a hypothetical assistant capable of answering any question they pose. The second study explores the interactions between developers and remote experts in supporting roles. Our results suggest eight key system features needed for on-demand remote developer assistants to be effective, which has implications for future human-powered development tools.","

The use of voice assistants in software development may lead to a loss of expertise and critical thinking skills among developers, as they rely more heavily on technology and less on their own knowledge and problem-solving abilities. This could result in a decrease in the overall quality of software development and potentially lead to more errors and bugs in software. Additionally, the reliance on remote experts may also lead to a loss of personal interaction and collaboration among developers, which could negatively impact the development process and the final product.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858512,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Cross-Field Aerial Haptics: Rendering Haptic Feedback in Air with Light and Acoustic Fields,"We present a new method of rendering aerial haptic images that uses femtosecond-laser light fields and ultrasonic acoustic fields. In conventional research, a single physical quantity has been used to render aerial haptic images. In contrast, our method combines multiple fields (light and acoustic fields) at the same time. While these fields have no direct interference, combining them provides benefits such as multi-resolution haptic images and a synergistic effect on haptic perception. We conducted user studies with laser haptics and ultrasonic haptics separately and tested their superposition. The results showed that the acoustic field affects the tactile perception of the laser haptics. We explored augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications such as providing haptic feedback of the combination of these two methods. We believe that the results of this study contribute to the exploration of laser haptic displays and expand the expression of aerial haptic displays based on other principles.","

The use of laser and acoustic fields in augmented reality/virtual reality applications can have a negative impact on users' tactile perception, potentially leading to discomfort or misinterpretation of sensations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858489,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Constructing the Visual Online Political Self: An Analysis of Instagram Use by the Scottish Electorate,"This paper presents an investigation of how the Scottish electorate utilised photo-sharing on social media as a means of participation in the democratic process and for political self-expression in the periods immediately prior to two recent major democratic votes: the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and the 2015 UK general election. We extend previous HCI literature on the growing use of social media in a political context and contribute specifically on understanding the emergent use of visual media by citizens when engaging with political issues and democratic process. Through a qualitative analysis of images shared on the platform Instagram, we demonstrate that the Scottish electorate did indeed used image-sharing for political self-expression -- posting a variety of visual content, representative of a diversity of political opinion. We conclude that users utilised Instagram as a platform to craft and present their ""political selves"". We raise questions for future research around power and inequality on such platforms as well as their capability of providing a persistent forum for debate.","

The use of social media for political self-expression and engagement can lead to the creation of echo chambers, where individuals only interact with those who share their views, reinforcing existing beliefs and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. This can contribute to the polarization of society and the erosion of civil discourse.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858160,Social Media,CHI,politics
#Snowden: Understanding Biases Introduced by Behavioral Differences of Opinion Groups on Social Media,"We present a study of 10-month Twitter discussions on the controversial topic of Edward Snowden. We demonstrate how behavioral differences of opinion groups can distort the presence of opinions on a social media platform. By studying the differences between a numerical minority (anti-Snowden) and a majority (pro-Snowden) group, we found that the minority group engaged in a ""shared audiencing"" practice with more persistent production of original tweets, focusing increasingly on inter-personal interactions with like-minded others. The majority group engaged in a ""gatewatching"" practice by disseminating information from the group, and over time shifted further from making original comments to retweeting others'. The findings show consistency with previous social science research on how social environment shapes majority and minority group behaviors. We also highlight that they can be further distorted by the collective use of social media design features such as the ""retweet"" button, by introducing the concept of ""amplification'"" to measure how a design feature biases the voice of an opinion group. Our work presents a warning to not oversimplify analysis of social media data for inferring social opinions.","Social media platforms can distort the presence of opinions, making it seem like certain views are more popular than they actually are. This is due to the way design features, such as the retweet button, can amplify certain voices and make them seem more prevalent than they actually are.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858422,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
ICT Use by Prominent Activists in Republika Srpska,"Bosnia-Herzegovina and its administrative unit or ""entity"", Republika Srpska are divided, transitional post-war societies. The aim of this paper is to present a preliminary analysis of regional activists' use of information and communication technology (ICT) and to identify improvement potential. Empirical investigations of social media use and qualitative interviews with the country's activists indicate strong interest in ICT. Benefits for the use of ICT by activists include more efficient access to their target group, easier information sharing with the general population, and quicker reaction to spontaneous ""offline"" activities. Simultaneously, data points to problems such as limited budgets and know-how, intensive outsourcing practices, and a significant lack of awareness regarding data security. Activists see improvement potential in areas of training on content optimization, campaign management, ICT use and maintenance, security, and privacy. Additionally, there is potential to improve upon the sustainability of activist's work and patterns related to their ICT outsourcing.","

Gender and Ideology in the Spread of Anti-Abortion Policy,"In the past few years an unprecedented wave of anti-abortion policies were introduced and enacted in state governments in the U.S., affecting millions of constituents. We study this rapid spread of policy change as a function of the underlying ideology of constituents. We examine over 200,000 public messages posted on Twitter surrounding abortion in the year 2013, a year that saw 82 new anti-abortion policies enacted. From these posts, we characterize people's expressions of opinion on abortion and show how these expressions align with policy change on these issues. We detail a number of ideological differences between constituents in states enacting anti versus pro-abortion policies, such as a tension between the moral values of purity versus fairness, and a differing emphasis on the fetus versus the pregnant woman. We also find significant differences in how males versus females discuss the issue of abortion, including greater emphasis on health and religion by males. Using these measures to characterize states, we can construct models to explain the spread of abortion policy from state to state and project which types of abortion policies a state will introduce. Models defining state similarity using our Twitter-based measures improved policy projection accuracy by 7.32% and 12.02% on average over geographic and poll-based ideological similarity, respectively. Additionally, models constructed from the expressions of male-only constituents perform better than models from the expressions of female-only constituents, suggesting that the ideology of men is more aligned with the recent spread of anti-abortion legislation than that of women.","Social media can be used to analyze and manipulate public opinion on controversial issues like abortion, potentially leading to policies that do not accurately reflect the views of all citizens, particularly those of women.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858423,Social Media,CHI,politics
AugKey: Increasing Foveal Throughput in Eye Typing with Augmented Keys,"Eye-typing is an important tool for people with physical disabilities and, for some, it is their main form of communication. By observing expert typists using physical keyboards, we notice that visual throughput is considerably reduced in current eye-typing solutions. We propose AugKey to improve throughput by augmenting keys with a prefix, to allow continuous text inspection, and suffixes to speed up typing with word prediction. AugKey limits the visual information to the foveal region to minimize eye movements (i.e., reduce eye work). We have applied AugKey to a dwell-time keyboard and compared its performance with two conditions with no augmented feedback: a keyboard with and one without word prediction. Results show that AugKey can be about 28% faster than no word prediction and 20% faster than traditional word prediction, with a smaller workload index.",Reduced visual throughput in current eye-typing solutions.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858517,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
A Sociotechnical Mechanism for Online Support Provision,"Social support can significantly improve health outcomes for individuals living with disease, and online forums have emerged as an important vehicle for social support. Whereas research has focused on the delivery and use of social support, little is known about how these communities are sustained. We describe one sociotechnical mechanism that enables sustainable communities to provide social support to a large number of people. We focus upon thirteen disease-specific discussion forums hosted by the WebMD online health community. In these forums, small, densely connected cores of members who maintain strong relationships generate the majority of support for others. Through content analysis we find they provide informational support to a large number of more itinerant members, but provide one another with community support. Based on these observations, we describe a sociotechnical mechanism of online support that is distinct from non-support oriented communities, and has implications for the design of self-sustaining online support systems.","Social Media technology can create a false sense of community and support, leading to a lack of meaningful connections and deep relationships. People may feel isolated and alone, despite being connected to many others online.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858582,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Youth Advocacy in SNAs: Challenges for Addressing Health Disparities,"Social networking applications (SNAs) have been touted as promising platforms for activism: they provide a platform by which voices can be heard and collective action mobilized. Yet, little work has studied the suitability of existing SNAs for enabling youth advocacy efforts. We conducted an intensive 5-week qualitative study with 10th graders to understand how existing SNAs support and inhibit youth advocacy. We contribute to the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by explicating several themes regarding the barriers youth face when using SNAs for advocacy, features in existing SNAs that are not suitable for youth advocacy, and the peer pressure youth perceive when advocating for serious issues in these environments. We conclude with recommendations for how existing SNA features could be reformed to better support youth advocacy.","Existing Social Media platforms are not suitable for youth advocacy efforts, and can even inhibit them due to various barriers and unsuitable features. Peer pressure can also discourage youth from advocating for serious issues on these platforms.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858492,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
HapThimble: A Wearable Haptic Device towards Usable Virtual Touch Screen,"A virtual touch screen concept using an optical see-through head-mounted display has been suggested. With a virtual touch screen, the user's direct-touch interactions are allowed in much the same way as a conventional touch screen, but the absence of haptic feedback and physical constraint leads to poor user performance. To overcome this issue, we developed a wearable haptic device, called HapThimble. It provides various types of haptic feedback (tactile, pseudo-force, and vibrotactile) to the user's fingertip and mimics physical buttons based on force-penetration depth curves. We conducted three experiments with HapThimble. The first experiment confirmed that HapThimble could increase a users' performance when conducting clicking and dragging tasks. The second experiment revealed that users could differentiate between six types of haptic feedback, rendered based on different force-penetration depth curves obtained using HapThimble. Last, we conducted a test to investigate the similarity between the physical buttons and the mimicked haptic buttons and obtained a 90.3% success rate.","

WearWrite: Crowd-Assisted Writing from Smartwatches,"The physical constraints of smartwatches limit the range and complexity of tasks that can be completed. Despite interface improvements on smartwatches, the promise of enabling productive work remains largely unrealized. This paper presents WearWrite, a system that enables users to write documents from their smartwatches by leveraging a crowd to help translate their ideas into text. WearWrite users dictate tasks, respond to questions, and receive notifications of major edits on their watch. Using a dynamic task queue, the crowd receives tasks issued by the watch user and generic tasks from the system. In a week-long study with seven smartwatch users supported by approximately 29 crowd workers each, we validate that it is possible to manage the crowd writing process from a watch. Watch users captured new ideas as they came to mind and managed a crowd during spare moments while going about their daily routine. WearWrite represents a new approach to getting work done from wearables using the crowd.","
The use of a crowd to translate ideas into text on smartwatches can lead to a lack of privacy and control over personal information. With a constant stream of data being sent to and from the smartwatch, there is a risk of sensitive information being intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. Additionally, the reliance on a crowd for data entry may lead to errors or inaccuracies in the translation process, which could have negative consequences for the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858169,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
"Anonymity, Intimacy and Self-Disclosure in Social Media","Self-disclosure is rewarding and provides significant benefits for individuals, but it also involves risks, especially in social media settings. We conducted an online experiment to study the relationship between content intimacy and willingness to self-disclose in social media, and how identification (real name vs. anonymous) and audience type (social ties vs. people nearby) moderate that relationship. Content intimacy is known to regulate self-disclosure in face-to-face communication: people self-disclose less as content intimacy increases. We show that such regulation persists in online social media settings. Further, although anonymity and an audience of social ties are both known to increase self-disclosure, it is unclear whether they (1) increase self-disclosure baseline for content of all intimacy levels, or (2) weaken intimacy's regulation effect, making people more willing to disclose intimate content. We show that intimacy always regulates self-disclosure, regardless of settings. We also show that anonymity mainly increases self-disclosure baseline and (sometimes) weakens the regulation. On the other hand, an audience of social ties increases the baseline but strengthens the regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that anonymity has a more salient effect on content of negative valence.The results are critical to understanding the dynamics and opportunities of self-disclosure in social media services that vary levels of identification and types of audience.","Social media platforms can encourage users to overshare personal information, leading to a loss of privacy and potential negative consequences, such as identity theft or reputational damage.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858414,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Mediating the Undercurrents: Using Social Media to Sustain a Social Movement,"While studies of social movements have mostly examined prevalent public discourses, undercurrents' the backstage practices consisting of meaning-making processes, narratives, and situated work-have received less attention. Through a qualitative interview study with sixteen participants, we examine the role of social media in supporting the undercurrents of the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. Interviews focused on an intense period of the movement exemplified by sit-in activities inspired by Occupy Wall Street in the USA. Whereas the use of Facebook for public discourse was similar to what has been reported in other studies, we found that an ecology of social media tools such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Google Docs mediated undercurrents that served to ground the public discourse of the movement. We discuss how the undercurrents sustained and developed public discourses in concrete ways.","Social media can support undercurrents of social movements, which can sustain and develop public discourses in concrete ways, but it can also mediate and ground public discourse in ways that are not always visible or transparent.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858186,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Designing Cyberbullying Mitigation and Prevention Solutions through Participatory Design With Teenagers,"While social media platforms enable individuals to easily communicate and share experiences, they have also emerged as a tool for cyberbullying. Teenagers represent an especially vulnerable population for negative emotional responses to cyberbullying. At the same time, attempts to mitigate or prevent cyberbullying from occurring in these networked spaces have largely failed because of the complexity and nuance with which young people bully others online. To address challenges related to designing for cyberbullying intervention and mitigation, we detail findings from participatory design work with two groups of high school students in spring 2015. Over the course of five design sessions spanning five weeks, participants shared their experiences with cyberbullying and iteratively designed potential solutions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the range of cyberbullying mitigation solutions participants designed. We focus on challenges participants' identified in designing for cyberbullying support and prevention and present a set of five potential cyberbullying mitigation solutions based on the results of the design sessions.","Cyberbullying, which can cause negative emotional responses, especially among teenagers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858548,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Understanding Social Media Disclosures of Sexual Abuse Through the Lenses of Support Seeking and Anonymity,"Support seeking in stigmatized contexts is useful when the discloser receives the desired response, but it also entails social risks. Thus, people do not always disclose or seek support when they need it. One such stigmatized context for support seeking is sexual abuse. In this paper, we use mixed methods to understand abuse-related posts on reddit. First, we take a qualitative approach to understand post content. Then we use quantitative methods to investigate the use of ""throwaway"" accounts, which provide greater anonymity, and report on factors associated with support seeking and first-time disclosures. In addition to significant linguistic differences between throwaway and identified accounts, we find that those using throwaway accounts are significantly more likely to engage in seeking support. We also find that men are significantly more likely to use throwaway accounts when posting about sexual abuse. Results suggest that subreddit moderators and members who wish to provide support pay attention to throwaway accounts, and we discuss the importance of context-specific anonymity in support seeking.","Social media platforms may not always provide the desired response or support, especially in stigmatized contexts such as sexual abuse. This can lead to a lack of disclosure and support seeking, which can further exacerbate the negative impact of the abuse. Additionally, men are more likely to use throwaway accounts when discussing sexual abuse, which may indicate a lack of trust in the platform or fear of judgment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858096,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Dear Diary: Teens Reflect on Their Weekly Online Risk Experiences,"In our study, 68 teens spend two months reflecting on their weekly online experiences and report 207 separate risk events involving information breaches, online harassment, sexual solicitations, and exposure to explicit content. We conduct a structured, qualitative analysis to characterize the salient dimensions of their risk experiences, such as severity, level of agency, coping strategies, and whether the teens felt like the situation had been resolved. Overall, we found that teens can potentially benefit from lower risk online situations, which allow them to develop crucial interpersonal skills, such as boundary setting, conflict resolution, and empathy. We can also use the dimensions of risk described in this paper to identify potentially harmful risk trajectories before they become high-risk situations. Our end goal is to find a way to empower and protect teens so that they can benefit from online engagement.","Social Media can expose teenagers to various online risks such as information breaches, harassment, sexual solicitations, and explicit content, which can potentially harm their development and well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858317,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Designing a Willing-to-Use-in-Public Hand Gestural Interaction Technique for Smart Glasses,"Smart glasses suffer from obtrusive or cumbersome interaction techniques. Studies show that people are not willing to publicly use, for example, voice control or mid-air gestures in front of the face. Some techniques also hamper the high degree of freedom of the glasses. In this paper, we derive design principles for socially acceptable, yet versatile, interaction techniques for smart glasses based on a survey of related work. We propose an exemplary design, based on a haptic glove integrated with smart glasses, as an embodiment of the design principles. The design is further refined into three interaction scenarios: text entry, scrolling, and point-and-select. Through a user study conducted in a public space we show that the interaction technique is considered unobtrusive and socially acceptable. Furthermore, the performance of the technique in text entry is comparable to state-of-the-art techniques. We conclude by reflecting on the advantages of the proposed design.","Obtrusive or cumbersome interaction techniques in smart glasses, such as voice control or mid-air gestures, can be unacceptable in public spaces.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858436,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Autonomous and Interdependent: Collaborative Privacy Management on Social Networking Sites,"Although information sharing on social networking sites (SNSs) usually involves multiple stakeholders, limited attention has been paid so far to conceptualizing users' information practices as a collaborative process. To fill this gap in the literature, we develop a survey study to examine collaborative privacy management strategies involving co-owners of shared content. By conducting two online surveys (N = 304, 427) with different samples, our findings show how individuals protect online privacy collaboratively and how their autonomous decision making regarding privacy management is shaped by the interdependent use of SNSs with their social connections. We discuss theoretical implications to privacy research and suggest design guidelines for better supporting users' needs for collaborating with their social ties to achieve collective privacy goals.","Social Media can make it difficult for individuals to protect their online privacy, as they often have to rely on others to manage their personal information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858415,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
The Power of Collective Endorsements: Credibility Factors in Medical Crowdfunding Campaigns,"Traditional medical fundraising charities have been relying on third-party watchdogs and carefully crafting their reputation over time to signal their credibility to potential donors. As medical fundraising campaigns migrate to online platforms in the form of crowdfunding, potential donors can no longer rely on the organization's traditional methods for achieving credibility. Individual fundraisers must establish credibility on their own. Potential donors, therefore, seek new factors to assess the credibility of crowdfunding campaigns. In this paper, we investigate current practices in assessing the credibility of online medical crowdfunding campaigns. We report results from a mixed-methods study that analyzed data from social media and semi-structured interviews. We discovered eleven factors associated with the perceived credibility of medical crowdfunding. Of these, three communicative/emotional factors were unique to medical crowdfunding. We also found a distinctive validation practice, the collective endorsement. Close-connections' online presence and external online communities come together to form this collective endorsement in online medical fundraising campaigns. We conclude by describing how fundraisers can leverage collective endorsements to improve their campaigns' perceived credibility.","

The shift to online crowdfunding platforms for medical fundraising has made it more difficult for donors to assess the credibility of campaigns, as they can no longer rely on traditional methods used by established charities. This has led to a greater emphasis on emotional and communicative factors, such as personal stories and social media presence, which may not accurately reflect the credibility of the campaign. Additionally, the use of collective endorsements, where close connections and online communities come together to support a campaign, can create a false sense of credibility. This can lead to untrustworthy campaigns receiving funding, while legitimate ones may struggle to gain support.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858289,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Storeoboard: Sketching Stereoscopic Storyboards,"We present Storeoboard, a system for stereo-cinematic conceptualization, via storyboard sketching directly in stereo. The resurgence of stereoscopic media has motivated filmmakers to evolve a new stereo-cinematic vocabulary, as many principles for stereo 3D film are unique. Concepts like plane separation, parallax position, and depth budgets are missing from early planning due to the 2D nature of existing storyboards. Storeoboard is the first of its kind, allowing filmmakers to explore, experiment and conceptualize ideas in stereo early in the film pipeline, develop new stereo-cinematic constructs and foresee potential difficulties. Storeoboard is the design outcome of interviews and field work with directors, stereographers, and storyboard artists. We present our design guidelines and implementation of a tool combining stereo-sketching, depth manipulations and storyboard features into a coherent and novel workflow. We report on feedback from storyboard artists, industry professionals and the director of a live action, feature film on which Storeoboard was deployed.","

Empath: Understanding Topic Signals in Large-Scale Text,"Human language is colored by a broad range of topics, but existing text analysis tools only focus on a small number of them. We present Empath, a tool that can generate and validate new lexical categories on demand from a small set of seed terms (like ""bleed"" and ""punch"" to generate the category violence). Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern fiction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered filter. Empath also analyzes text across 200 built-in, pre-validated categories we have generated from common topics in our web dataset, like neglect, government, and social media. We show that Empath's data-driven, human validated categories are highly correlated (r=0.906) with similar categories in LIWC.","

Additionally, the app's focus on leaving notes and building a community around spaces in between destinations may lead to an increase in litter and decreased sense of personal responsibility for one's surroundings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858573,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Motives and Concerns of Dashcam Video Sharing,"Dashcams support continuous recording of external views that provide evidence in case of unexpected traffic-related accidents and incidents. Recently, sharing of dashcam videos has gained significant traction for accident investigation and entertainment purposes. Furthermore, there is a growing awareness that dashcam video sharing will greatly extend urban surveillance. Our work aims to identify the major motives and concerns behind the sharing of dashcam videos for urban surveillance. We conducted two survey studies (n=108, n=373) in Korea. Our results show that reciprocal altruism/social justice and monetary reward were the major motives and that participants were strongly motivated by altruism and social justice. Our studies have also identified major privacy concerns and found that groups with greater privacy concerns had lower altruism and justice motive, but had higher monetary motive. Our main findings have significant implications on the design of a dashcam video-sharing service.","Privacy concerns.

The article highlights the growing trend of sharing dashcam videos for urban surveillance, which raises privacy concerns.

"Meerkat and Periscope: I Stream, You Stream, Apps Stream for Live Streams","We conducted a mixed methods study of the use of the Meerkat and Periscope apps for live streaming video and audio broadcasts from a mobile device. We crowdsourced a task to describe the content, setting, and other characteristics of 767 live streams. We also interviewed 20 frequent streamers to explore their motivations and experiences. Together, the data provide a snapshot of early live streaming use practices. We found a diverse range of activities broadcast, which interviewees said were used to build their personal brand. They described live streaming as providing an authentic, unedited view into their lives. They liked how the interaction with viewers shaped the content of their stream. We found some evidence for multiple live streams from the same event, which represent an opportunity for multiple perspectives on events of shared public interest.","

* Live streaming can be used to build personal brand, which can lead to narcissism and self-promotion.

The AT Effect: How Disability Affects the Perceived Social Acceptability of Head-Mounted Display Use,"Wearable computing devices offer new possibilities to increase accessibility and independence for individuals with disabilities. However, the adoption of such devices may be influenced by social factors, and useful devices may not be adopted if they are considered inappropriate to use. While public policy may adapt to support accommodations for assistive technology, emerging technologies may be unfamiliar or unaccepted by bystanders. We surveyed 1200 individuals about the use of a head-mounted display in a public setting, examining how information about the user's disability affected judgments of the social acceptability of the scenario. Our findings reveal that observers considered head-mounted display use more socially acceptable if the device was being used to support a person with a disability.",People may be less likely to adopt assistive technology if they are concerned about social acceptability.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858130,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Personalized Compass: A Compact Visualization for Direction and Location,"Maps on mobile/wearable devices often make it difficult to determine the location of a point of interest (POI). For example, a POI may exist outside the map or on a background with no meaningful cues. To address this issue, we present Personalized Compass, a self-contained compact graphical location indicator. Personalized Compass uses personal a priori POIs to establish a reference frame, within which a POI in question can then be localized. Graphically, a personalized compass combines a multi-needle compass with an abstract overview map. We analyze the characteristics of Personalized Compass and the existing Wedge technique, and report on a user study comparing them. Personalized Compass performs better for four inference tasks, while Wedge is better for a locating task. Based on our analysis and study results, we suggest the two techniques are complementary and offer design recommendations.",Difficulty in determining location of points of interest (POIs) on mobile/wearable devices.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858068,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Can Eye Help You?: Effects of Visualizing Eye Fixations on Remote Collaboration Scenarios for Physical Tasks,"In this work, we investigate how remote collaboration between a local worker and a remote collaborator will change if eye fixations of the collaborator are presented to the worker. We track the collaborator's points of gaze on a monitor screen displaying a physical workspace and visualize them onto the space by a projector or through an optical see-through head-mounted display. Through a series of user studies, we have found the followings: 1) Eye fixations can serve as a fast and precise pointer to objects of the collaborator's interest. 2) Eyes and other modalities, such as hand gestures and speech, are used differently for object identification and manipulation. 3) Eyes are used for explicit instructions only when they are combined with speech. 4) The worker can predict some intentions of the collaborator such as his/her current interest and next instruction.","

The use of eye-tracking technology in remote collaboration can lead to a loss of privacy for the remote collaborator, as their eye movements are being monitored and shared with the local worker. This could potentially create a sense of discomfort or unease for the remote collaborator, and could also raise concerns about the misuse of this information. Additionally, the reliance on eye movements for communication could lead to a lack of clarity or misunderstandings, as the remote collaborator's intentions may not always be clear through their eye movements alone.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858438,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
"""Like Having a Really Bad PA"": The Gulf between User Expectation and Experience of Conversational Agents","The past four years have seen the rise of conversational agents (CAs) in everyday life. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook have all embedded proprietary CAs within their software and, increasingly, conversation is becoming a key mode of human-computer interaction. Whilst we have long been familiar with the notion of computers that speak, the investigative concern within HCI has been upon multimodality rather than dialogue alone, and there is no sense of how such interfaces are used in everyday life. This paper reports the findings of interviews with 14 users of CAs in an effort to understand the current interactional factors affecting everyday use. We find user expectations dramatically out of step with the operation of the systems, particularly in terms of known machine intelligence, system capability and goals. Using Norman's 'gulfs of execution and evaluation' [30] we consider the implications of these findings for the design of future systems.","

LivingDesktop: Augmenting Desktop Workstation with Actuated Devices,"We investigate the potential benefits of actuated devices for the desktop workstation which remains the most used environment for daily office works. A formative study reveals that the desktop workstation is not a fixed environment because users manually change the position and the orientation of their devices. Based on these findings, we present the LivingDesktop, an augmented desktop workstation with devices (mouse, keyboard, monitor) capable of moving autonomously. We describe interaction techniques and applications illustrating how actuated desktop workstations can improve ergonomics, foster collaboration, leverage context and reinforce physicality. Finally, the findings of a scenario evaluation are (1) the perceived usefulness of ergonomics and collaboration applications; (2) how the LivingDesktop inspired our participants to elaborate novel accessibility and social applications; (3) the location and user practices should be considered when designed actuated desktop devices.","

The LivingDesktop, an augmented desktop workstation with autonomously moving devices, may lead to distractions and decreased productivity due to the novelty of the moving devices and the need for users to adapt to their new environment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858208,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"""With most of it being pictures now, I rarely use it"": Understanding Twitter's Evolving Accessibility to Blind Users","Social media is an increasingly important part of modern life. We investigate the use of and usability of Twitter by blind users, via a combination of surveys of blind Twitter users, large-scale analysis of tweets from and Twitter profiles of blind and sighted users, and analysis of tweets containing embedded imagery. While Twitter has traditionally been thought of as the most accessible social media platform for blind users, Twitter's increasing integration of image content and users' diverse uses for images have presented emergent accessibility challenges. Our findings illuminate the importance of the ability to use social media for people who are blind, while also highlighting the many challenges such media currently present this user base, including difficulty in creating profiles, in awareness of available features and settings, in controlling revelations of one's disability status, and in dealing with the increasing pervasiveness of image-based content. We propose changes that Twitter and other social platforms should make to promote fuller access to users with visual impairments.","Social media, specifically Twitter, has become less accessible for blind users due to the increasing integration of image content, presenting challenges in creating profiles, awareness of features and settings, controlling disability status, and dealing with image-based content.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858116,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"Sleep Debt in Student Life: Online Attention Focus, Facebook, and Mood","The amount of sleep college students receive has become a pressing societal concern. While studies show that information technology (IT) use affects sleep, here we examine the converse: how sleep duration might affect IT use. We conducted an in situ study, and logged computer and phone use and collected sleep diaries and daily surveys of 76 college students for seven days, all waking hours. We examined effects of sleep duration and sleep debt. Our results show that with less sleep, people report higher perceived work pressure and productivity. Also, computer focus duration is significantly shorter suggesting higher multitasking. The more sleep debt, the more Facebook use and the higher the negative mood. With less sleep, people may seek out activities requiring less attentional resources such as social media use. Our results have theoretical implications for multitasking: physiological and cognitive reasons could explain more computer activity switches: related to less sleep.","Social Media use increases with less sleep and sleep debt, potentially leading to decreased productivity, increased multitasking, and negative mood.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858437,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Social Media Image Analysis for Public Health,"Several projects have shown the feasibility to use emph{textual} social media data to track public health concerns, such as temporal influenza patterns or geographical obesity patterns. In this paper, we look at whether geo-tagged emph{images} from Instagram also provide a viable data source. Especially for ""lifestyle"" diseases, such as obesity, drinking or smoking, images of social gatherings could provide information that is not necessarily shared in, say, tweets. In this study, we explore whether (i) tags provided by the users and (ii) annotations obtained via automatic image tagging are indeed valuable for studying public health. We find that both user-provided and machine-generated tags provide information that can be used to infer a county's health statistics. Whereas for most statistics user-provided tags are better features, for predicting excessive drinking machine-generated tags such as ""liquid' and ""glass' yield better models. This hints at the potential of using machine-generated tags to study substance abuse.","Social media data can be used to track public health concerns, but it can also be used to monitor and study individuals' personal behaviors and habits, potentially infringing on their privacy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858234,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
It Matters If My Friends Stop Smoking: Social Support for Behavior Change in Social Media,"A growing body of research has examined whether and how an individual can leverage online social networks to receive social support for health behavior change. This prior research largely focuses on attributes of the post content and the experiences and concerns of people posting. Less is known about moderators and mediators that influence whether and how one's social network will respond to a request for support. Using a factorial survey experiment, we find evidence that attitudes toward specific types of health behaviors greatly increase likelihood of response to a post, and that targeting close-tie relationships may increase effectiveness of social media based behavior change interventions, particularly related to smoking cessation.","Social media can be ineffective in promoting health behavior change, especially for smoking cessation, if the post content and the relationships between the person posting and their network are not carefully considered.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858203,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
The 32 Days of Christmas: Understanding Temporal Intent in Image Search Queries,"Temporal terms, such as 'winter', 'Christmas', or 'January' are often used in search queries for personal images. But how do people's memories and perceptions of time match with the actual dates when their images were captured? We compared the temporal terms that 74 Flickr users used to search their own photo collections, and compared them to the date captured data in the target image. We also conducted a larger study across several billion images, comparing user-applied tags for holidays and seasons to the dates the images were captured. We demonstrate that various query terms and tags can be in conflict with the actual dates photos were taken for specific types of temporal terms up to 40% of the time. We will conclude by highlighting implications for search systems where users are querying for personal content by date.","
Users' memories and perceptions of time can be inaccurate, leading to conflicts between search queries and actual dates of photos taken, which can affect the reliability of personalized search results.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858255,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Influence of Content Layout and Motivation on Users' Herd Behavior in Social Discovery,"Social product discovery is an emerging paradigm that enables users to seek information and inspiration from peer-contributed contents. Researchers have observed herd behaviors in social discovery, i.e., basing beliefs and decisions on what similarly situated others have done. In this paper, we explore the effects of content layout and motivation on users' herd behaviors in social discovery. We conduct an eye-tracking study with 120 participants to compare goal- and action-oriented users' behaviors on a grid versus waterfall style social discovery site. The results show that users have a higher tendency to herd on a grid-style website, more so for goal-oriented users.","Social media platforms can encourage herd behavior, where users base their decisions and beliefs on what others have done, rather than making independent choices. This can lead to a lack of individuality and critical thinking.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858497,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Steel-Sense: Integrating Machine Elements with Sensors by Additive Manufacturing,"Many interactive devices use both machine elements and sensors, simultaneously but redundantly enabling and measuring the same physical function. We present Steel-Sense, an approach to joining these two families of elements to create a new type of HCI design primitive. We leverage recent developments in 3D printing to embed sensing in metal structures that are otherwise difficult to equip with sensors, and present four design principles, implementing (1) an electronic switch integrated within a ball bearing; (2) a voltage divider within a gear; (3) a variable capacitor embedded in a hinge; and (4) a pressure sensor within a screw. Each design demonstrates a different sensing principle, and signals its performance through (1) movement; (2) position; (3) angle (4) or stress. We mirror our elements physical performance in a virtual environment, evaluate our designs electronically and structurally, and discuss future work and implications for HCI research.","

The development of Steel-Sense technology, which embeds sensors within metal structures, could lead to a decrease in privacy for users. With sensors integrated into everyday objects, there is potential for constant monitoring and tracking of individuals' movements and actions, without their knowledge or consent. This could result in a loss of autonomy and privacy, as well as potential misuse of collected data.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858309,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Eye-Trace: Segmentation of Volumetric Microscopy Images with Eyegaze,"We introduce an image annotation approach for the analysis of volumetric electron microscopic imagery of brain tissue. The core task is to identify and link tubular objects (neuronal fibers) in images taken from consecutive ultrathin sections of brain tissue. In our approach an individual 'flies' through the 3D data at a high speed and maintains eye gaze focus on a single neuronal fiber, aided by navigation with a handheld gamepad controller. The continuous foveation on a fiber of interest constitutes an intuitive means to define a trace that is seamlessly recorded with a desktop eyetracker and transformed into precise 3D coordinates of the annotated fiber (skeleton tracing). In a participant experiment we validate the approach by demonstrating a tracing accuracy of about the respective radiuses of the traced fibers with browsing speeds of up to 40 brain sections per second.","

The use of virtual reality technology in the analysis of brain tissue images may lead to inaccurate tracing of neuronal fibers due to the limited resolution of the desktop eyetracker and the high speed at which the user is browsing through the images. This could result in incorrect annotations and ultimately affect the quality of research findings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858578,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Mirror Mirror: An On-Body T-shirt Design System,"Virtual fitting rooms equipped with magic mirrors let people evaluate fashion items without actually putting them on. The mirrors superimpose virtual clothes on the user's reflection. We contribute the Mirror Mirror system, which not only supports mixing and matching of existing fashion items, but also lets users design new items in front of the mirror and export designs to fabric printers. While much of the related work deals with interactive cloth simulation on live user data, we focus on collaborative design activities and explore various ways of designing on the body with a mirror.","

The Mirror Mirror system may encourage people to spend more time in front of screens, potentially leading to a sedentary lifestyle and negative impacts on physical and mental health.

VocalSketch: Vocally Imitating Audio Concepts,"A natural way of communicating an audio concept is to imitate it with one's voice. This creates an approximation of the imagined sound (e.g. a particular owl's hoot), much like how a visual sketch approximates a visual concept (e.g a drawing of the owl). If a machine could understand vocal imitations, users could communicate with software in this natural way, enabling new interactions (e.g. programming a music synthesizer by imitating the desired sound with one's voice). In this work, we collect thousands of crowd-sourced vocal imitations of a large set of diverse sounds, along with data on the crowd's ability to correctly label these vocal imitations. The resulting data set will help the research community understand which audio concepts can be effectively communicated with this approach. We have released the data set so the community can study the related issues and build systems that leverage vocal imitation as an interaction modality.","

The technology could lead to a decrease in the ability of humans to accurately identify and label sounds, as they become reliant on machines to understand and interpret vocal imitations. This could result in a loss of auditory skills and a diminished connection to the natural world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702387,Voice Assistant,CHI,health & well-being
An Evaluation of Multidimensional Controllers for Sound Design Tasks,"This paper presents an investigation into musicians' ability to control sound synthesiser parameters using various inter- faces. The principal aim was to compare separate, 1D parameter controls (touchscreen sliders) to multidimensional con- trollers (an XY touchpad for 2D, the Leap Motion for 3D). Subjects had to match a target sound as quickly and accurately as possible. Results show that after about two hours of practice, the XY pad is 9% faster than two sliders for no accuracy loss, and the Leap is 17% faster than 3 sliders with 9% accuracy loss. The multidimensional controllers improved most with practice. A new perspective on Fitts' index of difficulty is presented: ""Index of Search Space Reduction"" (ISSR). ISSR and retrospective accuracy thresholds on the search trajectory are used to obtain straight line plots and throughput values. These plots reveal that the Leap's speed improvement was mainly due to reaction time, but the XY pad traversed the space faster.","

The use of multidimensional controllers (such as the Leap Motion) for sound synthesis can lead to a faster and more accurate matching of target sounds, but it can also result in a loss of accuracy with prolonged use. This suggests that while these controllers may be beneficial for certain tasks, they may not be suitable for tasks that require high levels of accuracy over extended periods of time.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702499,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Remote Paper Prototype Testing,"To test paper prototypes of mobile applications, we have been experimenting with remote paper prototype testing as an approach and tool for enabling a designer to wizard a paper prototype from afar while a user tests the prototype out of the lab. This paper presents a system for remote paper prototype testing that consists of (1) a video camera placed over a paper prototype, which streams a live audio-visual feed via Google Hangouts to a tester, and (2) Google Glass on the tester, which streams a live audio-visual-data feed to the facilitator and wizard. Results from a pilot study found that remote paper prototype testing helped designers gain valuable insights through use in realistic scenarios.","

The use of remote paper prototype testing in the development of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology could lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction between designers and users, potentially limiting the ability to gather valuable feedback and insights.

Exploring 3D User Interface Technologies for Improving the Gaming Experience,"We present the results of a comprehensive video game study which explores how the gaming experience is effected when several 3D user interface technologies are used simultaneously. We custom designed an air-combat game integrating several 3DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head tracking, and finger-count gestures) and studied the combined effect of these technologies on the gaming experience. Our game design was based on existing design principles for optimizing the usage of these technologies in isolation. Additionally, to enhance depth perception and minimize visual discomfort, the game dynamically optimizes stereoscopic 3D parameters (convergence and separation) based on the user's look direction. We conducted a within subjects experiment where we examined performance data and self-reported data on users perception of the game. Our results indicate that participants performed significantly better when all the 3DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head-tracking and finger-count gestures) were available simultaneously with head tracking as a dominant factor. We explore the individual contribution of each of these technologies to the overall gaming experience and discuss the reasons behind our findings.","

The study found that the use of 3D user interface technologies in gaming can lead to a significant improvement in performance, but it can also lead to visual discomfort and fatigue. The use of stereoscopic 3D, head tracking, and finger-count gestures can be beneficial for the gaming experience, but it can also cause eye strain and discomfort, especially when the user is not accustomed to these technologies. The study suggests that the use of these technologies should be balanced with the need to minimize visual discomfort and fatigue.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702138,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
First Person vs. Third Person Perspective in Digital Games: Do Player Preferences Affect Immersion?,"Contemporary digital game developers offer a variety of games for the diverse tastes of their customers. Although the gaming experience often depends on one's preferences, the same may not apply to the level of their immersion. It has been argued whether the player perspective can influence the level of player's involvement with the game. The aim of this study was to research whether interacting with a game in first person perspective is more immersive than playing in the third person point of view (POV). The set up to test the theory involved participants playing a role-playing game in either mode, naming their preferred perspective, and subjectively evaluating their immersive experience. The results showed that people were more immersed in the game play when viewing the game world through the eyes of the character, regardless of their preferred perspectives.",Over-immersion in virtual reality games can lead to a decrease in real-world social interactions and a loss of touch with reality.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702256,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
"""I always assumed that I wasn't really that close to [her]"": Reasoning about Invisible Algorithms in News Feeds","Our daily digital life is full of algorithmically selected content such as social media feeds, recommendations and personalized search results. These algorithms have great power to shape users' experiences, yet users are often unaware of their presence. Whether it is useful to give users insight into these algorithms' existence or functionality and how such insight might affect their experience are open questions. To address them, we conducted a user study with 40 Facebook users to examine their perceptions of the Facebook News Feed curation algorithm. Surprisingly, more than half of the participants (62.5%) were not aware of the News Feed curation algorithm's existence at all. Initial reactions for these previously unaware participants were surprise and anger. We developed a system, FeedVis, to reveal the difference between the algorithmically curated and an unadulterated News Feed to users, and used it to study how users perceive this difference. Participants were most upset when close friends and family were not shown in their feeds. We also found participants often attributed missing stories to their friends' decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm. By the end of the study, however, participants were mostly satisfied with the content on their feeds. Following up with participants two to six months after the study, we found that for most, satisfaction levels remained similar before and after becoming aware of the algorithm's presence, however, algorithmic awareness led to more active engagement with Facebook and bolstered overall feelings of control on the site.","Users are often unaware of the algorithms that shape their digital experiences, leading to a lack of control and understanding over what they see and interact with online.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702556,Social Media,CHI,user experience
News Feed: What's in it for Me?,"Over a billion people use social networking sites like Facebook to maintain awareness of their friends. Facebook's News Feed is the primary mechanism by which people are shown updates about their friends' daily activities on the site in the form of an algorithmically curated list of stories. This paper examines how people browse the News Feed, their perceptions and satisfaction while using it, and the interactions they make with their personal social network. We conducted a qualitative study involving think-aloud semi-structured interviews as the participants casually browsed their own feeds. We observed a wide variation in the use of the News Feed ranging from careful consideration of social conventions, judgment of people, and annoyance and frustration towards certain friends. Our findings suggest that people do not deliberately curate their own News Feed either due to lack of awareness or perceived social repercussions.","Social Media can lead to annoyance and frustration towards certain friends, and people may not be aware of how algorithms curate their news feed.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702554,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Understanding User Beliefs About Algorithmic Curation in the Facebook News Feed,"People are becoming increasingly reliant on online socio-technical systems that employ algorithmic curation to organize, select and present information. We wanted to understand how individuals make sense of the influence of algorithms, and how awareness of algorithmic curation may impact their interaction with these systems. We investigated user understanding of algorithmic curation in Facebook's News Feed, by analyzing open-ended responses to a survey question about whether respondents believe their News Feeds show them every post their Facebook Friends create. Responses included a wide range of beliefs and causal inferences, with different potential consequences for user behavior in the system. Because user behavior is both input for algorithms and constrained by them, these patterns of belief may have tangible consequences for the system as a whole.","People's reliance on algorithmic curation in social media can lead to a narrow and biased view of information, which may have negative impacts on their understanding of the world and their interactions with others.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702174,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
How Activists Are Both Born and Made: An Analysis of Users on Change.org,"E-petitioning has become one of the most important and popular forms of online activism. Although e-petition success is driven by user behavior, users have received relatively little study by HCI and social computing researchers. Drawing from theoretical and empirical work in analogous social computing systems, we identify two potentially competing theories about the trajectories of users in e-petition platforms: (1) ""power"" users in social computing systems are born, not made; and (2) users mature into ""power"" users. In a quantitative analysis of data from Change.org, one of the largest online e-petition platforms, we test and find support for both theories. A follow-up qualitative analysis shows that not only do users learn from their experience, systems also ""learn"" from users to make better recommendations. In this sense, we find that although power users are ""born,"" they are also ""made"" through both processes of personal growth and improved support from the system.","

The article highlights the potential for users to become ""power users"" on e-petition platforms, which can lead to a negative impact on the overall user experience. Power users may dominate the platform, making it difficult for other users to have their voices heard. Additionally, the system may prioritize the recommendations of power users over those of other users, further perpetuating this imbalance. This can result in a lack of diversity in the voices and opinions represented on the platform, leading to a less inclusive and democratic online environment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702559,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"Personalized, Wearable Control of a Head-mounted Display for Users with Upper Body Motor Impairments","Head-mounted displays provide relatively hands-free interaction that could improve mobile computing access for users with motor impairments. To investigate this largely unexplored area, we present two user studies. The first, smaller study evaluated the accessibility of Google Glass, a head-mounted display, with 6 participants. Findings revealed potential benefits of a head-mounted display yet demonstrated the need for alternative means of controlling Glass-3 of the 6 participants could not use it at all. We then conducted a second study with 12 participants to evaluate a potential alternative input mechanism that could allow for accessible control of a head-mounted display: switch-based wearable touchpads that can be affixed to the body or wheelchair. The study assessed input performance with three sizes of touchpad, investigated personalization patterns when participants were asked to place the touchpads on their body or wheelchair, and elicited subjective responses. All 12 participants were able to use the touchpads to control the display, and patterns of touchpad placement point to the value of personalization in providing support for each user's motor abilities.","
The article highlights the potential benefits of head-mounted displays for individuals with motor impairments, but also notes that some individuals may not be able to use the technology due to the need for alternative input mechanisms. The study found that switch-based wearable touchpads can be an effective alternative, but the need for personalization in terms of touchpad placement and size may be important for some users. This suggests that there may be a lack of accessibility for some individuals with motor impairments, and that further research is needed to ensure that augmented/virtual reality technology is accessible to all.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702188,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Designing Conversation Cues on a Head-Worn Display to Support Persons with Aphasia,"Symbol-based dictionaries of text, images and sound can help individuals with aphasia find the words they need, but are often seen as a last resort because they tend to replace rather than augment the user's natural speech. Through two design investigations, we explore head-worn displays as a means of providing unobtrusive, always-available, and glanceable vocabulary support. The first study used narrative storyboards as a design probe to explore the potential benefits and challenges of a head-worn approach over traditional augmented alternative communication (AAC) tools. The second study then evaluated a proof-of-concept prototype in both a lab setting with the researcher and in situ with unfamiliar conversation partners at a local market. Findings suggest that a head-worn approach could better allow wearers to maintain focus on the conversation, reduce reliance on the availability of external tools (e.g., paper and pen) or people, and minimize visibility of the support by others. These studies should motivate further investigation of head-worn conversational support.","

Head-Mounted Display Visualizations to Support Sound Awareness for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing,"Persons with hearing loss use visual signals such as gestures and lip movement to interpret speech. While hearing aids and cochlear implants can improve sound recognition, they generally do not help the wearer localize sound necessary to leverage these visual cues. In this paper, we design and evaluate visualizations for spatially locating sound on a head-mounted display (HMD). To investigate this design space, we developed eight high-level visual sound feedback dimensions. For each dimension, we created 3-12 example visualizations and evaluated these as a design probe with 24 deaf and hard of hearing participants (Study 1). We then implemented a real-time proof-of-concept HMD prototype and solicited feedback from 4 new participants (Study 2). Study 1 findings reaffirm past work on challenges faced by persons with hearing loss in group conversations, provide support for the general idea of sound awareness visualizations on HMDs, and reveal preferences for specific design options. Although preliminary, Study 2 further contextualizes the design probe and uncovers directions for future work.","

The use of visual sound feedback dimensions in head-mounted displays (HMDs) may not be effective for individuals with hearing loss in group conversations, as it may not help the wearer localize sound.

g-Miner: Interactive Visual Group Mining on Multivariate Graphs,"With the rapid growth of rich network data available through various sources such as social media and digital archives,there is a growing interest in more powerful network visual analysis tools and methods. The rich information about the network nodes and links can be represented as multivariate graphs, in which the nodes are accompanied with attributes to represent the properties of individual nodes. An important task often encountered in multivariate network analysis is to uncover link structure with groups, e.g., to understand why a person fits a specific job or certain role in a social group well.The task usually involves complex considerations including specific requirement of node attributes and link structure, and hence a fully automatic solution is typically not satisfactory.In this work, we identify the design challenges for min-ing groups with complex criteria and present an interactive system, ""g-Miner,"" that enables visual mining of groups on multivariate graph data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through case study and in-depth expert inter-views.

Twist and Learn: Interface Learning in 3DOF Exploration of 3D Scatterplots,"The increasing availability of 3D interfaces brings promise of improved user experience in diverse areas. Our study focuses on visual analytics, testing whether 3D interactivity improves performance in a visual data exploration task. Specifically, we compared scene rotation around vertical axis to a full 3D rotation using a InterSense IS-900 3D controller, in a task involving trivariate trend detection in a 3D scatterplot. We found that, while 3D rotation leads to slower performance, previous exposure to single-axis rotation removes that difference. This shows that an interactive 3D scatterplot can be an effective visual exploration technique for detecting trivariate patterns in the data, and highlights the role of interface learning in design and assessment of novel interfaces.","

Over-reliance on 3D visualization tools may lead to slower performance in data analysis tasks, potentially hindering the ability to detect important patterns and trends in the data.

THING: Introducing a Tablet-based Interaction Technique for Controlling 3D Hand Models,"The hands of virtual characters are highly complex 3D models that can be tedious and time-consuming to animate with current methods. This paper introduces THING, a novel tablet-based approach that leverages multi-touch interaction for a quick and precise control of a 3D hand's pose. The flexion/extension and abduction/adduction of the virtual fingers can be controlled for each finger individually or for several fingers in parallel through sliding motions on the tablet's surface. We designed two variants of THING: (1) MobileTHING, which maps the spatial location and orientation of the tablet to that of the virtual hand, and (2) DesktopTHING, which combines multi-touch controls of fingers with traditional mouse controls for the hand's global position and orientation. We compared the usability of THING against mouse-only controls and a data glove in two controlled experiments. Results show that DesktopTHING was significantly preferred by users while providing performance similar to data gloves. Together, these results could pave the way to the introduction of novel hybrid user interfaces based on tablets and mice in future animation pipelines.","

The use of tablets and mice in animation pipelines could lead to a decrease in the use of data gloves, which provide a more immersive and natural experience for users.

Survival Analysis: Objective assessment of Wait Time in HCI,"Waiting for the completion of a system process is an everyday experience. While waiting, system provides feedback to the user about ongoing process through temporal metaphors (Progress bar, Busy icons, etc.). One of the key performance requirement for temporal metaphors is to retain the user till the process completes. Researchers have evaluated these metaphors through subjective means, and objective assessment has not been well explored. In this paper, we present survival analysis as objective assessment method to evaluate temporal metaphors. Through a field experiment, we demonstrate the application of survival analysis and empirically establish that auditory progress bar (temporal metaphor for audio interfaces) works for callers of a distress helpline. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study on distress callers. The paper further discusses the applicability of survival analysis for evaluating temporal metaphors and wait time experiments for other applications, tasks, and settings.","

The use of temporal metaphors in voice assistants, such as progress bars or busy icons, can lead to increased wait times for users. This can be particularly problematic for distress callers, who may be in a vulnerable state and in need of immediate assistance. The use of auditory progress bars, in particular, has been found to be ineffective for distress callers, as it can lead to increased frustration and anxiety.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702428,Voice Assistant,CHI,health & well-being
Sangeet Swara: A Community-Moderated Voice Forum in Rural India,"Interactive voice forums have emerged as a promising platform for people in developing regions to record and share audio messages using low-end mobile phones. However, one of the barriers to the scalability of voice forums is the process of screening and categorizing content, often done by a dedicated team of moderators. We present Sangeet Swara, a voice forum for songs and cultural content that relies on the community of callers to curate high-quality posts that are prioritized for playback to others. An 11-week deployment of Sangeet Swara found broad and impassioned usage, especially among visually impaired users. We also conducted a follow-up experiment, called Talent Hunt, that sought to reduce reliance on toll-free telephone lines. Together, our deployments span about 53,000 calls from 13,000 callers, who submitted 6,000 posts and 150,000 judgments of other content. Using a mixed-methods analysis of call logs, audio content, comparison with outside judges, and 204 automated phone surveys, we evaluate the user experience, the strengths and weaknesses of community moderation, financial sustainability, and the implications for future systems.","
The use of voice forums for cultural content, such as Sangeet Swara, may lead to a reliance on community moderation, which can be ineffective in filtering out low-quality or inappropriate content. This can result in a poor user experience and potentially harmful or offensive content being shared. Additionally, the use of toll-free telephone lines may not be financially sustainable, leading to a need for alternative methods to support the platform.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702191,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Mobile Phones for Maternal Health in Rural India,"We present our findings from a mixed methods study of mobile phone practices of rural Indian women. We situate our study in the context of Projecting Health, a public health initiative we deployed in Uttar Pradesh (India) to target the dissemination of health information for mothers and newborns. Adopting the lens of feminist reflexivity, we reconsider our design of Projecting Health by factoring in the mobile media consumption and sharing practices of our target audience. We stress the importance of taking a community-oriented approach and show that although there are strict social conventions and patriarchal norms that constrain various practices of these women, they are able to exercise agency and mobilize help within their communities when needed.","

Crowdsourced Exploration of Security Configurations,"Smartphone apps today request permission to access a multitude of sensitive resources, which users must accept completely during installation (e.g., on Android) or selectively configure after installation (e.g., on iOS, but also planned for Android). Everyday users, however, do not have the ability to make informed decisions about which permissions are essential for their usage. For enhanced privacy, we seek to leverage crowdsourcing to find minimal sets of permissions that will preserve the usability of the app for diverse users. We advocate an efficient 'lattice-based' crowd-management strategy to explore the space of permissions sets. We conducted a user study (N = 26) in which participants explored different permission sets for the popular Instagram app. This study validates our efficient crowd management strategy and shows that usability scores for diverse users can be predicted accurately, enabling suitable recommendations.","Users are often forced to accept unnecessary permissions when installing smartphone apps, which can compromise their privacy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702370,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy

The Virtual Meditative Walk: Virtual Reality Therapy for Chronic Pain Management,"Because the nature of chronic pain is complex, pharmacological analgesics are often not enough to achieve an ideal treatment plan. Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have emerged within medical research in recent years for treating acute pain, and proved to be an effective strategy based on pain distraction. This paper describes a VR system designed for chronic pain patients. The system incorporates biofeedback sensors, an immersive virtual environment, and stereoscopic sound titled the ""Virtual Meditative Walk"" (VMW). It was designed to enable chronic pain patients to learn Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a form of meditation. By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback, VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain. A proof-of-concept user study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the VR system with chronic pain patients in clinical settings. Results show that the VMW was more effective in reducing perceived pain compared to the non-VR control condition.","

The use of Virtual Reality technology for chronic pain management may lead to dependence on technology for pain relief, rather than addressing the root cause of the pain. This could result in a decrease in motivation for patients to make lifestyle changes or seek alternative treatments that could provide long-term solutions. Additionally, the immersive nature of VR may lead to a decrease in social interaction and an increase in isolation, which could have negative effects on mental health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702344,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Making Social Matching Context-Aware: Design Concepts and Open Challenges,"Social matching systems recommend people to people. In an ideal world, such systems could be context-aware, in that they would introduce users to each other in situations where they are mutually interested, available and open to meeting (i.e., facilitate a valuable encounter). Unfortunately, today's systems primarily match individuals based on simple similarity and proximity metrics. This paper explores how contextual information available on today's mobile phones could be used to identify opportunities for people to make valuable new connections. Three types of context that are relevant for this work are: relational, social and personal. We present insights gained from several iterations of semi-structured interviewing (N=58) exploring these three types of contexts and propose novel context-aware social matching concepts such as: sociability of others as an indicator of opportune social context; activity involvement as an indicator of opportune personal context; and contextual rarity as an indicator of opportune relational context.",Social Media technology can lead to superficial connections and missed opportunities for meaningful interactions.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702343,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
The Known Stranger: Supporting Conversations between Strangers with Personalized Topic Suggestions,"Striking up a good conversation with new acquaintances is often a difficult problem. In this paper we report on the perceptions of wearable device users who were given real-time personalized topic suggestions during a conversation with a person they just met. Suggestions were generated using a ranking recommendation algorithm, and were delivered via Google Glasses. We conducted a study with 38 pairs of strangers, who received such suggestions while conversing for the first time. Participants found the suggestions to be helpful, but only at the right moments, and for certain types of speakers. Our results contribute to the understanding of how communication interventions influence people's experience and behaviors, and enhance interpersonal interactions. Our study also presents design implications for applications on wearable devices to facilitate conversations between strangers.","People may become too reliant on technology for social interactions, rather than developing their own communication skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702411,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Augmenting Social Interactions: Realtime Behavioural Feedback using Social Signal Processing Techniques,"Nonverbal and unconscious behaviour is an important component of daily human-human interaction. This is especially true in situations such as public speaking, job interviews or information sensitive conversations, where researchers have shown that an increased awareness of one's behaviour can improve the outcome of the interaction. With wearable technology, such as Google Glass, we now have the opportunity to augment social interactions and provide realtime feedback on one's behaviour in an unobtrusive way. In this paper we present Logue, a system that provides realtime feedback on the presenters' openness, body energy and speech rate during public speaking. The system analyses the user's nonverbal behaviour using social signal processing techniques and gives visual feedback on a head-mounted display. We conducted two user studies with a staged and a real presentation scenario which yielded that Logue's feedback was perceived helpful and had a positive impact on the speaker's performance.","

Run Spot Run: Capturing and Tagging Footage of a Race by Crowds of Spectators,"There has been a massive growth in the number of people who film and upload amateur footage of events to services such as Facebook and Youtube, or even stream live to services such as LiveStream. We present an exploratory study that investigates the potential of these spectators in creating footage en masse; in this case, during a live trial at a local marathon. We deployed a prototype app, RunSpotRun, as a technology probe to see what kinds of footage spectators would produce. We present an analysis of this footage in terms of its coverage, quality, and contents, and also discuss the implications for a) spectators enjoying the race, and b) extracting the stories of individual runners throughout the race. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges that remain for deploying such technology at a larger scale.","

"Crowdsourcing Synchronous Spectator Support: (go on, go on, you're the best)n-1","Many studies have shown that crowd-support, such as cheering during sport events, can have a positive impact on athletes' performance. However, up until recently this support was only possible if the supporters and the athletes were geographically co-located. Can cheering be done remotely and would this be effective? In this paper we investigate the effect and possibilities of live remote cheering on co-located athletes and online supporting crowds that have a weak social tie and no social tie with the athlete. We recruit 140 online spectators and 5 athletes for an ad-hoc 5km road race. Results indicate that crowds socially closer to the athletes are significantly more engaged in the support. The athletes were excited by live remote cheering from friendsourced spectators and cheering from unknown crowdsourced participants indicating that remote friends and outsourced spectators could be an important source of support.","Social Media technology can make people feel isolated and disconnected from others, even when they are physically surrounded by a crowd.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702338,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
"Can an Algorithm Know the ""Real You""?: Understanding People's Reactions to Hyper-personal Analytics Systems","Recent research has developed analytics that threaten online self-presentation and privacy by automatically generating profiles of individuals' most personal traits-their personality, values, motivations, and so on. But we know little about people's reactions to personal traits profiles of themselves, or what influences their decisions to share such profiles. We present an early qualitative study of people's reactions to a working hyper-personal analytics system. The system lets them see their personality and values profile derived from their own social media text. Our results reveal a paradox. Participants found their personal traits profiles creepily accurate and did not like sharing them in many situations. However, they felt pressured by the social risks of not sharing and showed signs of learned helplessness, leading them to share despite their misgivings. Further, they felt unqualified to significantly modify their profile contents due to a surprising trust in the ""expert"" algorithm. We explore design implications for hyper-personal analytics systems that consider the needs and preferences of the people being profiled, suggesting ways to enhance the control they feel and the benefits they reap.","Social Media technology can create a pressure to share personal information, even when users are uncomfortable with it, due to the fear of social risks and a misplaced trust in algorithms.

Mapping out Work in a Mixed Reality Project Room,"We present results from a study examining how the physical layout of a project room and task affect the cognitive maps acquired of a connected virtual environment during mixed-presence collaboration. Results indicate that a combination of physical layout and task impacts cognitive maps of the virtual space. Participants did not form a strong model of how different physical work regions were situated relative to each other in the virtual world when the tasks performed in each region differed. Egocentric perspectives of multiple displays enforced by different furniture arrangements encouraged cognitive maps of the virtual world that reflected these perspectives, when the displays were used for the same task. These influences competed or coincided with document-based, audiovisual and interface cues, influencing collaboration. We consider the implications of our findings on WYSIWIS mappings between real and virtual for mixed-presence collaboration.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can negatively impact users' ability to form accurate mental maps of virtual environments, leading to confusion and disorientation.

Your Money's No Good Here: The Elimination of Cash Payment on London Buses,"As digital payments become increasingly important features of economic exchange, traditional forms of payment such as cash are becoming phased out in certain settings. We study one such context-the elimination of cash payment on London buses in July 2014. We conducted ethnographic fieldwork, interviews with drivers and collected online and social media comments before, during and shortly after the introduction of cashless fares. We explore how drivers and passengers were fearful of the change due in part to a lack of information and communication, the anticipation of negative effects on vulnerable passengers and a compromise in freedom, flexibility and surveillance. We highlight the ways cashless payments can alter the social function of money, create new forms of work for drivers and passengers, and if not carefully introduced can cause emotional stress and fears of state surveillance and control.",Cashless payments can create emotional stress and fears of state surveillance and control.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702137,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
AudioScope: Smartphones as Directional Microphones in Mobile Audio Augmented Reality Systems,"Mobile audio augmented reality systems (MAARS) provide a new and engaging modality to present information or to create playful experiences. Using special filters, spatial audio rendering creates the impression that the sound of a virtual source emanates from a certain position in the physical space. So far, most of the implementations of such systems rely on head tracking to create a realistic effect, which requires additional hardware. Recent results indicate that the built-in sensors of a smartphone can be used as source for orientation measurement, reducing deployment to a simple app download. AudioScope presents an alternative interaction technique to create such an experience, using the metaphor of pointing a directional microphone at the environment. In an experiment with 20 users, we compared the time to locate a proximate audio source and the perceived presence in the virtual environment. Results show that there is no significant difference between head-orientation measurement and AudioScope regarding accuracy and perceived presence. This means that MAARS, such as audio guides for museums, do not require special hardware but can run on the visitor's smartphones with standard headphones.",Over-reliance on technology and decreased spatial awareness.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702159,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being

Gauging Receptiveness to Social Microvolunteering,"Crowd-powered systems that help people are difficult to scale and sustain because human labor is expensive and worker pools are difficult to grow. To address this problem we introduce the idea of social microvolunteering, a type of intermediated friendsourcing in which a person can provide access to their friends as potential workers for microtasks supporting causes that they care about. We explore this idea by creating Visual Answers, an exemplar social microvolunteering application for Facebook that posts visual questions from people who are blind. We present results of a survey of 350 participants on the concept of social microvolunteering, and a deployment of the Visual Answers application with 91 participants, which collected 618 high-quality answers to questions asked over 12 days, illustrating the feasibility of the approach.","Social Media technology can lead to exploitation of users as cheap labor for tasks that benefit the platform, rather than the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702329,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice

Effects of Public Commitments and Accountability in a Technology-Supported Physical Activity Intervention,"Walking and other forms of physical activity have many health benefits, but people often fail to follow through on their own goals of being more active. To address gaps in current understanding of how to design technology-supported physical activity interventions, we conducted a randomized field experiment of a commitment device: making public announcements. In a control condition, weekly commitments were kept private. In two treatment conditions, they were announced on Facebook and by email. In one of the two, the announcements also included results: whether the previous week's commitment was kept. We find that, with or without public results, these posts can elicit supportive replies from the poster's social networks. People in both public announcements conditions were less likely to make commitments. We conclude that the prospect of public accountability may suppress the making of commitments in a way that counteracts the benefits of that accountability.

Glass Unlock: Enhancing Security of Smartphone Unlocking through Leveraging a Private Near-eye Display,"This paper presents Glass Unlock, a novel concept using smart glasses for smartphone unlocking, which is theoretically secure against smudge attacks, shoulder-surfing, and camera attacks. By introducing an additional temporary secret like the layout of digits that is only shown on the private near-eye display, attackers cannot make sense of the observed input on the almost empty phone screen. We report a user study with three alternative input methods and compare them to current state-of-the-art systems. Our findings show that Glass Unlock only moderately increases authentication times and that users favor the input method yielding the slowest input times as it avoids focus switches between displays.","

From Third to Surveilled Place: The Mobile in Irish Pubs,"A home away from home, the pub is synonymous with good conversation. Yet, the art of conversation in pubs is changing with the ubiquity of mobile phones. We present a qualitative study spanning over three years describing experiences and rhetoric surrounding the relationship that mobiles have and should have with our conversation in the pub. We found that mobile phones are able to enhance conversation but can also cause a disruption to the informal and adhoc nature of pubs. The use of Facebook on mobile phones has also changed pubs from what Oldenburg terms a third space to a space that is potentially being surveilled. We suggest future designs should not necessarily discourage or encourage mobile use in pubs, but rather provoke us into reflecting on how intertwined modern conversation is with mobile technology in the context of the pub space.","Social Media technology, such as Facebook on mobile phones, can disrupt the informal and spontaneous nature of pub conversations and turn them into potentially surveilled spaces, changing the atmosphere and purpose of the traditional pub.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702574,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Is This Thing On?: Crowdsourcing Privacy Indicators for Ubiquitous Sensing Platforms,"We are approaching an environment where ubiquitous computing devices will constantly accept input via audio and video channels: kiosks that determine demographic information of passersby, gesture controlled home entertainment systems and audio controlled wearable devices are just a few examples. To enforce the principle of least privilege, recent proposals have suggested technical approaches to limit third-party applications to receiving only the data they need, rather than entire audio or video streams.

Managing Children's Online Identities: How Parents Decide what to Disclose about their Children Online,"While extensive research has investigated the risks of children sharing their personal information online, little work has investigated the implications of parents sharing personal information about their children online. Drawing on 102 interviews with parents in the U.S., we investigate how parents decide what to disclose about their children on social network sites (SNSs). We find that mothers take on the responsibility of sharing content about their children more than fathers do. Fathers are more restrictive about sharing to broad and professional audiences and are concerned about sharing content that could be perceived as sexually suggestive. Both mothers and fathers work to leverage affordances of SNSs to limit oversharing. Building on prior work, we explore parental disclosure management, which describes how parents decide what to share about their children online. We also describe an emerging third shift of work that highlights the additional work parents take on to manage children's identities online.

Understanding and Supporting Fathers and Fatherhood on Social Media Sites,"Fathers are taking on more childcare and household responsibilities than they used to and many non-profit and government organizations have pushed for changes in policies to support fathers. Despite this effort, little research has explored how fathers go online related to their roles as fathers. Drawing on an interview study with 37 fathers, we find that they use social media to document and archive fatherhood, learn how to be a father, and access social support. They also go online to support diverse family needs, such as single fathers' use of Reddit instead of Facebook, fathers raised by single mothers' search for role models online, and stay-at-home fathers' use of father blogs. However, fathers are constrained by privacy concerns and perceptions of judgment relating to sharing content online about their children. Drawing on theories of fatherhood, we present theoretical and design ideas for designing online spaces to better support fathers and fatherhood.

Keepin' it Real: Challenges when Designing Sports-Training Games,"Using game elements and mechanics in sports training holds great potential for increasing player enjoyment, but also introduces a risk of reducing training relevance. This paper describes a novel training installation for individual handball training, called ""The Bouncer"", and the design process behind three training games. In order to investigate how game elements can affect the training experience, we conducted a study with 10 experienced amateur handball players, eliciting responses regarding the training relevance of the games. Based on the study and our design insights, we propose three challenges that designers of interactive sports-training games need to consider: 1) Maintaining relevance when translating physical elements into digital representations. 2) Choosing an appropriate level of sensing as game input. 3) Introducing points in training exercises without reducing sport relevance. For the three challenges, we propose strategies to help future designers of training games.",Reduced training relevance due to the introduction of game elements and mechanics in sports training.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702243,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
In the Heat of the Moment: Subjective Interpretations of Thermal Feedback During Interaction,"Research has shown that thermal feedback can be an engaging and convincing means of conveying experimenter-predefined meanings, e.g., material properties or message types. However, thermal perception is subjective and its meaning in interaction can be ambiguous. Interface designers may not be sure how users could naïvely interpret thermal feedback during interaction. Little is also known about how users would choose thermal cues to convey their own meanings. The research in this paper tested subjective interpretations of thermal stimuli in three different scenarios: social media activity, a colleague's presence and the extent of use of digital content. Participants were also asked to assign their own thermal stimuli to personal experiences, to help us understand what kinds of stimuli people associate with different meanings. The results showed strong agreement among participants concerning what warmth (presence, activity, quality) and cool mean (absence, poor quality). Guidelines for the design of thermal feedback are presented to help others create effective thermal interfaces.","Social Media technology can lead to ambiguous interpretation of thermal feedback, potentially causing miscommunication and misunderstandings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702219,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Pause Moment Experience in SNS Communication,"The evolution of SNS applications has focused on the increasing pace of communication. Accordingly, adopting pause moment design for the SNS domain becomes significant, considering its worth for mental well-being and diversity of experience. Nonetheless, the vision is currently controversial, as it is lacking in attempts to examine the worth of pause moment design for SNS communication. Therefore, we discussed the benefits of pause moment design as an SNS application, based on the case of Ripening Room. From observation, we have identified three benefits of pause moment design; preserving room for solitude, expanding time experience, and providing additional indirect cues for communication. Nevertheless, the benefits also imply limitations of the current design, thus require following attempts to adopt a pause moment design for the SNS domain.",Social Media can lead to a lack of solitude and deepened mental health issues due to constant communication.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702435,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Content Destabilization for Head-Mounted Displays,"With recent progress in display technology, visual see-through head-mounted displays are beginning to enter our everyday lives. Especially in cars they may replace head-up displays, as they can theoretically perfectly imitate them but are more flexible to use. However, prior work has shown that both screen- and vehicle-stabilized content suffer from drawbacks such as occlusion or technological limitations. As a potential alternative, we propose three concept alternatives, in which head rotation is used to manipulate the displayed content differently from both of the known stabilization techniques. In a qualitative user study, we identify the best concept proposal and then evaluate it against the established content stabilization techniques. The presented concept is perceived to be more applicable for the proposed use case and effectively reduces some of the known problems of both stabilization techniques.","

The article highlights the potential drawbacks of using Augmented/Virtual Reality technology in cars, such as occlusion or technological limitations.

A Dose of Reality: Overcoming Usability Challenges in VR Head-Mounted Displays,"We identify usability challenges facing consumers adopting Virtual Reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) in a survey of 108 VR HMD users. Users reported significant issues in interacting with, and being aware of their real-world context when using a HMD. Building upon existing work on blending real and virtual environments, we performed three design studies to address these usability concerns. In a typing study, we show that augmenting VR with a view of reality significantly corrected the performance impairment of typing in VR. We then investigated how much reality should be incorporated and when, so as to preserve users' sense of presence in VR. For interaction with objects and peripherals, we found that selectively presenting reality as users engaged with it was optimal in terms of performance and users' sense of presence. Finally, we investigated how this selective, engagement-dependent approach could be applied in social environments, to support the user's awareness of the proximity and presence of others.","

Accuracy of Pedometry on a Head-mounted Display,"The accuracy of pedometry varies depending on where an inertial sensor is located on the body. Motivated by the increasing popularity of wearable computing, this paper investigates the accuracy with which pedometry can be achieved on a head-mounted device: something previous research has not investigated. A study with 16 subjects compares the accuracy of pedometry for walking and running with an inertial sensor located at the head, pocket and hand/arm. Our study did not detect a significant difference in step counting accuracy between sensor locations, which demonstrates the feasibility of pedometry-based apps for head-mounted displays.",Inaccurate tracking of physical activity due to sensor location.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702143,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Level-Ups: Motorized Stilts that Simulate Stair Steps in Virtual Reality,"We present ""Level-Ups"", computer-controlled stilts that allow virtual reality users to experience walking up and down steps. Each Level-Up unit is a self-contained device worn like a boot. Its main functional element is a vertical actuation mechanism mounted to the bottom of the boot that extends vertically. Unlike traditional solutions that are integrated with locomotion devices, Level-Ups allow users to walk around freely (""real-walking""). We present Level-Ups in a demo environment based on a head-mounted display, optical motion capture, and integrated with two different game engines. In a user study, participants rated the realism of stepping onto objects 6.0 out of 7.0 when wearing Level-Ups compared to 3.5 without.","

The use of Level-Ups, computer-controlled stilts that allow virtual reality users to experience walking up and down steps, may lead to a decrease in the user's sense of reality. The device can create a false sense of walking and stepping, potentially causing users to become disconnected from the physical world and their own body's movements. This could result in a decrease in balance and coordination, as well as a loss of awareness of their surroundings. Additionally, the device may also lead to an over-reliance on technology, further diminishing the user's connection to the physical world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702253,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
This Digital Life: A Neighborhood-Based Study of Adolescents' Lives Online,"In this paper, we present the results of a multi-year study of the social computing practices of 179 adolescents (Mage=12.4 years, SD=1.3; range: 10-14) living in a majority-minority lower-income urban neighborhood in the Southeast U.S. We investigate shifting social media practices using annual surveys and focus groups. We describe participants' social media use and motivations and show how that use has shifted over time. We show how participants identify social pressures and influences as well as specific behaviors including computer-mediated risky behaviors and self-harm. We discuss the implications of our findings for the CHI research community, including methodological challenges and the need for further study of computer-mediated harmful behaviors in youth populations. By demonstrating how large-scale trends are enacted on the ground, we describe participants' uses, motivations and behaviors as they deal with the increasing influence of technology in their social lives.","Social Media technology can lead to computer-mediated risky behaviors and self-harm among adolescents, especially in lower-income urban neighborhoods.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702534,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
ActivPass: Your Daily Activity is Your Password,"This paper explores the feasibility of automatically extracting passwords from a user's daily activity logs, such as her Facebook activity, phone activity etc. As an example, a smartphone might ask the user: ""Today morning from whom did you receive an SMS?"" In this paper, we observe that infrequent activities (i.e., outliers) can be memorable and unpredictable. Building on this observation, we have developed an end to end system ActivPass and experimented with 70 users. With activity logs from Facebook, browsing history, call logs, and SMSs, the system achieves 95% success (authenticates legitimate users) and is compromised in 5.5% cases (authenticates impostors). While this level of security is obviously inadequate for serious authentication systems, certain practices such as password sharing can immediately be thwarted from the dynamic nature of passwords. With security improvements in the future, activity-based authentication could fill in for the inadequacies in today's password-based systems.",Social Media activity can be used to extract passwords and compromise security.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702457,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Constructing Secure Audio CAPTCHAs by Exploiting Differences between Humans and Machines,"To prevent abuses of Internet services, CAPTCHAs are used to distinguish humans from programs where an audio-based scheme is beneficial to support visually impaired people. Previous studies show that most audio CAPTCHAs, albeit hard to solve for humans, are lacking security strength. In this work we propose an audio CAPTCHA that is far more robust against automated attacks than it is reported for current CAPTCHA schemes. The CAPTCHA exhibits a good trade-off between human usability and security. This is achieved by exploiting the fact that the human capabilities of language understanding and speech recognition are clearly superior compared to current machines. We evaluate the CAPTCHA security by using a state-of-the-art attack and assess the intelligibility by means of a large-scale listening experiment.","Current audio-based CAPTCHAs are not secure and can be easily solved by machines, which can lead to abuses of internet services.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702127,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
ImmerseBoard: Immersive Telepresence Experience using a Digital Whiteboard,"ImmerseBoard is a system for remote collaboration through a digital whiteboard that gives participants a 3D immersive experience, enabled only by an RGBD camera (Microsoft Kinect) mounted on the side of a large touch display. Using 3D processing of the depth images, life-sized rendering, and novel visualizations, ImmerseBoard emulates writing side-by-side on a physical whiteboard, or alternatively on a mirror. User studies involving three tasks show that compared to standard video conferencing with a digital whiteboard, ImmerseBoard provides participants with a quantitatively better ability to estimate their remote partners' eye gaze direction, gesture direction, intention, and level of agreement. Moreover, these quantitative capabilities translate qualitatively into a heightened sense of being together and a more enjoyable experience. ImmerseBoard's form factor is suitable for practical and easy installation in homes and offices.","

Data-Things: Digital Fabrication Situated within Participatory Data Translation Activities,"This paper explores a design-led approach to digital fabrication which situates it in participatory data translation activities to demonstrate that this technology can find application beyond its use as tool for manufacture. We present two contrasting design contexts in which, respectively, data from conference twitter conversations and craft practitioners' movements are translated into interactively generated and fabricated physical artefacts. We argue that direct involvement in such digital fabrication activities can help people invest meaning into artefacts and facilitate social interaction and reflection upon their activities, while encouraging practitioners to incorporate new forms into their own work. On this basis, we reconsider digital fabrication within data translation activities as situated along an extended 'trajectory of use' in which reflective, meaningful 'data-things' can be created.","People may become too focused on creating physical artifacts using digital fabrication technology, and neglect the social and reflective aspects of the process. This could lead to a lack of meaningful interaction and personal connection, as well as a lack of consideration for the impact of the technology on society.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702245,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
I'd Hide You: Performing Live Broadcasting in Public,"We present a study of a mixed reality game called 'I'd Hide You' that involves live video streaming from the city streets. We chart the significant challenges facing performers on the streets who must simultaneously engage in the game, stream compelling video footage featuring themselves, and interact with a remote online audience. We reveal how these street performers manage four key tensions: between their body and camera; between the demands of online audiences and what takes place on-the-street; between what appears 'frontstage' on camera versus what happens 'backstage'; and balancing being a player of the game with being a performer. By reflecting on how they achieve this, we are able to draw out wider lessons for future interfaces aimed at supporting people broadcasting video of themselves to online audiences while engaged in games, sports and other demanding real-world activities.","

The study highlights the challenges faced by street performers who must juggle multiple tasks while live streaming, such as engaging in the game, interacting with the remote audience, and managing their image on camera. This can lead to stress and pressure to perform, potentially negatively impacting the performers' well-being. Additionally, the constant need to balance different aspects of their performance may result in a lack of focus on the game itself, leading to mistakes and decreased enjoyment for both the performers and the audience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702257,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Modeling Ideology and Predicting Policy Change with Social Media: Case of Same-Sex Marriage,"Social media has emerged as a prominent platform where people can express their feelings about social and political issues of our time. We study the many voices discussing an issue within a constituency and how they reflect ideology and may signal the outcome of important policy decisions. Focusing on the issue of same-sex marriage legalization, we examine almost 2 million public Twitter posts related to same-sex marriage in the U.S. states over the course of 4 years starting from 2011. Among other findings, we find evidence of moral culture wars between ideologies and show that constituencies that express higher levels of emotion and have fewer actively engaged participants often precede legalization efforts that fail. From our measures, we build statistical models to predict the outcome of potential policy changes, with our best model achieving 87% accuracy. We also achieve accuracies of 70%, comparable to public opinion surveys, many months before a policy decision. We discuss how these analyses can augment traditional political science techniques as well as assist activists and policy analysts in understanding discussions on important issues at a population scale.",Social media can amplify moral culture wars and influence policy decisions in a way that may not accurately reflect the views of the broader population.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702193,Social Media,CHI,politics
"""Is it Weird to Still Be a Virgin"": Anonymous, Locally Targeted Questions on Facebook Confession Boards","People have long sought answers to questions online, typically using either anonymous or pseudonymous forums or social network platforms that primarily use real names. Systems that allow anonymous communication afford freedom to explore identity and discuss taboo topics, but can result in negative disinhibited behavior such as cyberbullying. Identifiable communication systems allows one to reach a known audience and avoid negative disinhibition, but can constrain behavior with concerns about privacy and reputation. One persistent design issue is understanding how to leverage the benefits of anonymity without suffering its drawbacks. This paper presents a case study analysis of question asking on Facebook confession boards (FCBs), a tool popular on some college campuses. FCBs present a unique configuration in which members of an offline community (e.g., a university) anonymously submit content to a moderator who posts it to a Facebook page where others in the community can view it and respond. Response is via identifiable Facebook comments and likes. Our results show users asking about taboo and stigmatized topics with local others, and receiving relevant responses with little cyberbullying or negativity.",Social Media can result in negative disinhibited behavior such as cyberbullying when allowing anonymous communication.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702410,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Social Media Dynamics of Global Co-presence During the 2014 FIFA World Cup,"Sporting championships and other media events can induce very strong feelings of co-presence that can change communication patterns within large communities. Live tweeting reactions to media events provide high-resolution data with time-stamps to understand these behavioral dynamics. We employ a computational focus group method to identify a population of 790,744 international Twitter users, and we track their behavior before, during, and after the 2014 FIFA World Cup. We pick, in particular, a set of Twitter users who specified the teams that they are supporting, such that we can identify communities of fans of the teams, as well as the entire community of World Cup fans. The structure, dynamics, and content of communication of these communities of users are analyzed to compare behavior outside of the matches to behavior during the event and to examine behavioral responses across languages. Specifically, the temporal patterns of the tweeting volume, topics, retweet- ing, and mentioning behaviors are analyzed. We find there are similarities in the responses to media events, characteristic changes in activity patterns of users, and substantial differences in linguistic features. These findings have implications for designing more resilient socio-technical systems during crises and developing better models of complex social behavior.","Social Media can create echo chambers where people only interact with those who share their beliefs and interests, leading to a lack of diversity in perspectives and potentially reinforcing harmful biases.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702317,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Bridges into the Unknown: Personalizing Connections to Little-known Countries,"How are you related to Malawi? Do recent events on the Comoros effect you in any subtle way? Who in your extended social network is in Croatia? We seldom ask ourselves these questions, yet a ""long tail"" of content beyond our everyday knowledge is waiting to be explored. In this work we propose a recommendation task of creating interest in little-known content by building personalized ""bridges"" to users. We consider an example task of interesting users in little-known countries, and propose a system which aggregates a user's Twitter profile, network, and tweets to create an interest model, which is then matched to a library of knowledge about the countries. We perform a user study of 69 participants and conduct 11 in-depth interviews in order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach and gather qualitative insight into the effect of multi-faceted use of Twitter on the perception of the bridges. We find the increase in interest concerning little-known content to greatly depend on the pre-existing disposition to it. Additionally, we discover a set of vital properties good bridges must possess, including recency, novelty, emotiveness, and a proper selection of language. Using the proposed approach we aim to harvest the ""invisible connections"" to make explicit the idea of a ""small world"" where even a faraway country is more closely connected to you than you might have imagined.","Social Media can create a false sense of connection and closeness to faraway countries and cultures, making users less likely to engage with local issues and communities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702152,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Networked Empowerment on Facebook Groups for Parents of Children with Special Needs,"Theories of empowerment explain how people gain personal and political control to take action to improve their lives. However, empowerment theories were developed prior to the Internet and fail to account for the speed and scale that people can find one another online. One domain where empowerment is critical is caring for children with special needs, in which parents are required to navigate a complex maze of services and processes to access care for their child. We conducted 43 interviews with parents of children with special needs to investigate whether using social media sites helps them to perform this caregiving work. Critically, parents are able to do this through almost real-time access to other parents on Facebook. This work introduces the concept of networked empowerment, that describes how parents find other parents, access resources, and explore new ways for promoting health advocacy among caregivers at a local and national level. We conclude with design implications for facilitating faster and better access to information and support for caregivers.","

Cyclops: Wearable and Single-Piece Full-Body Gesture Input Devices,"This paper presents Cyclops, a single-piece wearable device that sees its user's whole body postures through an ego-centric view of the user that is obtained through a fisheye lens at the center of the user's body, allowing it to see only the user's limbs and interpret body postures effectively. Unlike currently available body gesture input systems that depend on external cameras or distributed motion sensors across the user's body, Cyclops is a single-piece wearable device that is worn as a pendant or a badge. The main idea proposed in this paper is the observation of limbs from a central location of the body. Owing to the ego-centric view, Cyclops turns posture recognition into a highly controllable computer vision problem. This paper demonstrates a proof-of-concept device, and an algorithm for recognizing static and moving bodily gestures based on motion history images (MHI) and a random decision forest (RDF). Four example applications of interactive bodily workout, a mobile racing game that involves hands and feet, a full-body virtual reality system, and interaction with a tangible toy are presented. The experiment on the bodily workout demonstrates that, from a database of 20 body workout gestures that were collected from 20 participants, Cyclops achieved a recognition rate of 79% using MHI and simple template matching, which increased to 92% with the more advanced machine learning approach of RDF.","

The device could potentially invade privacy by constantly monitoring the user's body language and movements, even without their knowledge or consent. This could lead to a loss of personal autonomy and privacy, as well as potential misuse of the collected data. Additionally, the device's ability to recognize and interpret body postures could potentially be used to manipulate or control individuals, either through subtle cues or overt instructions. This could have negative implications for individuals who are already vulnerable or oppressed.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702464,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Social Media Effectiveness for Public Engagement: Example of Small Nonprofits,"Social media sites are increasingly adopted by small nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to help them meet their public engagement goals. However, several characteristics of small organizations make it hard for them to effectively use social media sites. We present findings from interviews with 26 small NPOs' social media professionals on how they use multiple social media sites to support public engagement. Small NPOs use multiple social media sites to engage with different stakeholders toward various ends. However, these NPOs are not using social media to its full potential with regard to community-building and action mobilization. Several challenges in small NPOs, such as ineffective measurement of social media performance, deficient organizational resources, and lack of control over work, lead to strong tensions between social media engagement strategies and outcomes. Drawing on these findings, we present several practical implications for the design of successful public engagement social media tools.","Small nonprofit organizations (NPOs) are not using social media to its full potential for community-building and action mobilization due to various challenges such as ineffective measurement of social media performance, deficient organizational resources, and lack of control over work.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702557,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Designing Political Deliberation Environments to Support Interactions in the Public Sphere,"Little is known about the challenges and successes people face when piecing together multiple social media to interact in the online public sphere when: seeking information, disseminating information, and engaging in political discussions. We interviewed 29 US citizens and conducted 17 talk-out-loud sessions with people who were using one or more social media technologies, such as Facebook and Twitter, to interact in the online public sphere. We identified a number of challenges and workarounds related to public sphere interactions, and used our findings to formulate requirements for new political environments that support the interactions in the public sphere. Through evolving requirements generation, we developed a new political deliberation technology, dubbed Poli, which is an integrated social media environment with the potential to enable more effective interactions in the public sphere. We discuss several remaining questions and limitations to our tool that will drive future work.","

Debating Poverty Porn on Twitter: Social Media as a Place for Everyday Socio-Political Talk,"This paper presents an empirical investigation of how people appropriated Twitter for socio-political talk in response to a television (TV) portrayal of people supported by state welfare and benefits. Our findings reveal how online discussion during, and in-between, TV broadcasts was characterised by distinctly different qualities, topics and user behaviours. These findings offer design opportunities for social media services to (i) support more balanced real-time commentaries of politically-charged media, (ii) actively promote discussion to continue after, and between, programming; and (iii) incorporate different motivations and attitudes towards socio-political concerns, as well as different practices of communicating those concerns. We contribute to the developing HCI literature on how social media intersects with political and civic engagement and specifically highlight the ways in which Twitter interacts with other forms of media as a site of everyday socio-political talk and debate.","Social media can spread misinformation and reinforce harmful stereotypes, especially when it comes to politically charged issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702291,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Recognizing Depression from Twitter Activity,"In this paper, we extensively evaluate the effectiveness of using a user's social media activities for estimating degree of depression. As ground truth data, we use the results of a web-based questionnaire for measuring degree of depression of Twitter users. We extract several features from the activity histories of Twitter users. By leveraging these features, we construct models for estimating the presence of active depression. Through experiments, we show that (1) features obtained from user activities can be used to predict depression of users with an accuracy of 69%, (2) topics of tweets estimated with a topic model are useful features, (3) approximately two months of observation data are necessary for recognizing depression, and longer observation periods do not contribute to improving the accuracy of estimation for current depression; sometimes, longer periods worsen the accuracy.","Social Media activities can be used to estimate degree of depression, which raises privacy concerns as it can be used to monitor and track individuals' mental health without their consent.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702280,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
You Tweet What You Eat: Studying Food Consumption Through Twitter,"Food is an integral part of our lives, cultures, and well-being, and is of major interest to public health. The collection of daily nutritional data involves keeping detailed diaries or periodic surveys and is limited in scope and reach. Alternatively, social media is infamous for allowing its users to update the world on the minutiae of their daily lives, including their eating habits. In this work we examine the potential of Twitter to provide insight into US-wide dietary choices by linking the tweeted dining experiences of 210K users to their interests, demographics, and social networks. We validate our approach by relating the caloric values of the foods mentioned in the tweets to the state-wide obesity rates, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.77 across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia. We then build a model to predict county-wide obesity and diabetes statistics based on a combination of demographic variables and food names mentioned on Twitter. Our results show significant improvement over previous CHI research (Culotta 2014). We further link this data to societal and economic factors, such as education and income, illustrating that areas with higher education levels tweet about food that is significantly less caloric. Finally, we address the somewhat controversial issue of the social nature of obesity (Christakis & Fowler 2007) by inducing two social networks using mentions and reciprocal following relationships.","Social media can contribute to the normalization and glorification of unhealthy eating habits, as people share and compare their food choices online.

Collective Sensemaking in Online Health Forums,"Online health communities collect vast amounts of information and opinions in regards to health and wellness management. However, these opinions are usually stored within lengthy and loosely structured discussion threads; synthesizing information in these threads can be challenging. In this mixed-methods study, grounded in the theoretical perspective of collective sensemaking, we examined patterns of communication within an online diabetes community TuDiabetes. The results of the study suggest that members of TuDiabetes often construct shared meaning through deep discussions, back and forth negotiation of perspectives, and resolution of conflicts in opinions. However, unlike participants of other sensemaking communities, members of TuDiabetes often value multiplicity of opinions rather than consensus. We use study results to draw implications for the design of computing platforms for facilitating collective sensemaking that promote construction of shared knowledge yet embrace diversity of opinions.","

Substitutional Reality: Using the Physical Environment to Design Virtual Reality Experiences,"Experiencing Virtual Reality in domestic and other uncontrolled settings is challenging due to the presence of physical objects and furniture that are not usually defined in the Virtual Environment. To address this challenge, we explore the concept of Substitutional Reality in the context of Virtual Reality: a class of Virtual Environments where every physical object surrounding a user is paired, with some degree of discrepancy, to a virtual counterpart. We present a model of potential substitutions and validate it in two user studies. In the first study we investigated factors that affect participants' suspension of disbelief and ease of use. We systematically altered the virtual representation of a physical object and recorded responses from 20 participants. The second study investigated users' levels of engagement as the physical proxy for a virtual object varied. From the results, we derive a set of guidelines for the design of future Substitutional Reality experiences.","

The Semantic Paintbrush: Interactive 3D Mapping and Recognition in Large Outdoor Spaces,"We present an augmented reality system for large scale 3D reconstruction and recognition in outdoor scenes. Unlike existing prior work, which tries to reconstruct scenes using active depth cameras, we use a purely passive stereo setup, allowing for outdoor use and extended sensing range. Our system not only produces a map of the 3D environment in real-time, it also allows the user to draw (or 'paint') with a laser pointer directly onto the reconstruction to segment the model into objects. Given these examples our system then learns to segment other parts of the 3D map during online acquisition. Unlike typical object recognition systems, ours therefore very much places the user 'in the loop' to segment particular objects of interest, rather than learning from predefined databases. The laser pointer additionally helps to 'clean up' the stereo reconstruction and final 3D map, interactively. Using our system, within minutes, a user can capture a full 3D map, segment it into objects of interest, and refine parts of the model during capture. We provide full technical details of our system to aid replication, as well as quantitative evaluation of system components. We demonstrate the possibility of using our system for helping the visually impaired navigate through spaces. Beyond this use, our system can be used for playing large-scale augmented reality games, shared online to augment streetview data, and used for more detailed car and person navigation.","

The system's reliance on user input to segment objects of interest could lead to biased or inaccurate 3D models, as users may not always provide accurate or consistent labeling.

User-Defined Game Input for Smart Glasses in Public Space,"Smart glasses, such as Google Glass, provide always-available displays not offered by console and mobile gaming devices, and could potentially offer a pervasive gaming experience. However, research on input for games on smart glasses has been constrained by the available sensors to date. To help inform design directions, this paper explores user-defined game input for smart glasses beyond the capabilities of current sensors, and focuses on the interaction in public settings. We conducted a user-defined input study with 24 participants, each performing 17 common game control tasks using 3 classes of interaction and 2 form factors of smart glasses, for a total of 2448 trials. Results show that users significantly preferred non-touch and non-handheld interaction over using handheld input devices, such as in-air gestures. Also, for touch input without handheld devices, users preferred interacting with their palms over wearable devices (51% vs 20%). In addition, users preferred interactions that are less noticeable due to concerns with social acceptance, and preferred in-air gestures in front of the torso rather than in front of the face (63% vs 37%).","Overuse of AR technology can lead to social isolation and decreased human interaction, as people become more focused on virtual experiences than real-life interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702214,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Retargeting Technical Documentation to Augmented Reality,"We present a system which automatically transfers printed technical documentation, such as handbooks, to three-dimensional Augmented Reality. Our system identifies the most frequent forms of instructions found in printed documentation, such as image sequences, explosion diagrams, textual annotations and arrows indicating motion. The analysis of the printed documentation works automatically, with minimal user input. The system only requires the documentation itself and a CAD model or 3D scan of the object described in the documentation. The output is a fully interactive Augmented Reality application, presenting the information from the printed documentation in 3D, registered to the real object.","Over-reliance on technology may lead to decreased critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as a loss of understanding of the underlying principles and mechanics of the technology itself.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702490,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
TerraGuide: Design and Evaluation of a Multi-Surface Environment for Terrain Visibility Analysis,"Terrain visibility analysis is a challenging task that is currently supported by complex digital tools with cumbersome interfaces. In this paper, we present TerraGuide, a novel multi-surface environment for exploratory terrain analysis. TerraGuide provides three tightly coupled displays including a real-time viewshed, a 3D panoramic view, and a helicopter view controlled by an optically tracked tablet. A user study compared these techniques and identified users' strategies in solving a complex terrain analysis problem. Users overwhelmingly adopted a bi-manual use of the tabletop viewshed and tablet-based helicopter techniques. This paper gives insight into how multi-surface environments can be designed to allow complementary use of and fluid switching between techniques.","Users may become too reliant on technology and neglect important skills, such as spatial awareness and problem-solving abilities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702480,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Robots, Pancakes, and Computer Games: Designing Serious Games for Robot Imitation Learning","Autonomous manipulation robots can be valuable aids as interactive agents in the home, yet it has proven extremely difficult to program their behavior. Imitation learning uses data on human demonstrations to build behavioral models for robots. In order to cover a wide range of action strategies, data from many individuals is needed. Acquiring such large amounts of data can be a challenge. Tools for data capturing in this domain must thus implement a good user experience. We propose to use human computation games in order to gather data on human manual behavior. We demonstrate the idea with a strategy game that is operated via a natural user interface. A comparison between using the game for action execution and demonstrating actions in a virtual environment shows that people interact longer and have a better experience when playing the game.","People may spend more time playing games and interacting with virtual environments than they do in the real world, leading to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and a loss of social skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702552,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
"Accurate, Robust, and Flexible Real-time Hand Tracking","We present a new real-time hand tracking system based on a single depth camera. The system can accurately reconstruct complex hand poses across a variety of subjects. It also allows for robust tracking, rapidly recovering from any temporary failures. Most uniquely, our tracker is highly flexible, dramatically improving upon previous approaches which have focused on front-facing close-range scenarios. This flexibility opens up new possibilities for human-computer interaction with examples including tracking at distances from tens of centimeters through to several meters (for controlling the TV at a distance), supporting tracking using a moving depth camera (for mobile scenarios), and arbitrary camera placements (for VR headsets). These features are achieved through a new pipeline that combines a multi-layered discriminative reinitialization strategy for per-frame pose estimation, followed by a generative model-fitting stage. We provide extensive technical details and a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis.","

The development of advanced hand-tracking technology for use in virtual and augmented reality systems could lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and social skills, as people become more reliant on technology to communicate and interact with their surroundings. This could result in a loss of important social cues and nuances, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications. Additionally, the ability to control technology with hand gestures could lead to a sense of detachment from the physical world and a lack of awareness of the impact of one's actions on others.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702179,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
Investigating the Dexterity of Multi-Finger Input for Mid-Air Text Entry,"This paper investigates an emerging input method enabled by progress in hand tracking: input by free motion of fingers. The method is expressive, potentially fast, and usable across many settings as it does not insist on physical contact or visual feedback. Our goal is to inform the design of high-performance input methods by providing detailed analysis of the performance and anatomical characteristics of finger motion. We conducted an experiment using a commercially available sensor to report on the speed, accuracy, individuation, movement ranges, and individual differences of each finger. Findings show differences of up to 50% in movement times and provide indices quantifying the individuation of single fingers. We apply our findings to text entry by computational optimization of multi-finger gestures in mid-air. To this end, we define a novel objective function that considers performance, anatomical factors, and learnability. First investigations of one optimization case show entry rates of 22 words per minute (WPM). We conclude with a critical discussion of the limitations posed by human factors and performance characteristics of existing markerless hand trackers.","

The use of hand tracking technology for input methods in augmented and virtual reality environments could lead to a decrease in physical contact and visual feedback, potentially resulting in a loss of tactile and sensory experiences for users. This could have negative impacts on user engagement, learning, and overall well-being. Additionally, the reliance on computational optimization for text entry could lead to a lack of individualization and personalization for users, potentially leading to decreased performance and efficiency.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702136,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Providing Adaptive Support in an Interactive Simulation for Learning: An Experimental Evaluation,"Recent rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) with unlimited participants, makes employing learning tools such as interactive simulations all but inevitable. Interactive simulations give students the opportunity to experiment with concrete examples and develop better understanding of concepts they have learned. However, some students do not learn well from this relatively unstructured form of interaction, suggesting the provision of adaptive support as a way to address this issue. This paper presents a formal evaluation of providing support to facilitate open exploration. We describe the process of designing an intervention delivery mechanism for adding adaptive support to an exploratory interactive simulation. The experimental evaluation of the adaptive version of the simulation indicates that the adaptive support provided to students significantly improved their learning performance. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of users' acceptance of the system are generally positive but pinpoint areas for improvement.","

Mining Memories: Designing a Platform to Support Social Media Based Writing,"Many teens struggle with school writing and particularly in identifying personally relevant topics, which motivate writing improvement. However, a wealth of potential topics is available through their social media data. We explore the design of Sparkfolio, a prewriting support tool that aims to help students successfully prepare meaningful writing topics from their own social media content. This web-delivered tool was evaluated with 46 teen users in the context of their high school English class. Findings demonstrate that the use of social media can enhance the quality of written outcomes, as Sparkfolio users had significantly greater gains than a control group.","Social Media can negatively impact the quality of written outcomes.

Google+ Communities as Plazas and Topic Boards,"Researchers have recently been focusing on understanding online communities in social networks that offer easy access to new audiences. How do online communities function within these social networks? In this work, we conducted a mixed-method study of public Google+ Communities and found two major types evident in both how users talk about them and how they appear to use them: plazas to meet new people, and topic boards to discuss common interests. This reflects two common motivations users cite in describing Communities: ""meeting like minded people"" and ""finding great content"". We characterize these two types of Communities within Google+ using mixed methods including surveys, interviews, and quantitative analytics, and expose differences in user behaviors between them.","Social Media platforms can create echo chambers where users only interact with like-minded individuals, leading to a lack of diversity in perspectives and ideas.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702600,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"Offline Strangers, Online Friends: Bridging Classroom Gender Segregation with WhatsApp","Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) apps such as WhatsApp are heralding new communication behaviors amongst students in peri-urban India. From an ethnographic study of a co-ed engineering college, we describe and analyze the role of WhatsApp in both engendering and balancing the ripples caused by cross gender communication. Through in-depth interviews and immersive participant observations in both physical as well as digital spaces, we show how WhatsApp emerges as the backbone of student interactions in a gender segregated academic environment. In analyzing social conditions and identifying structural features of WhatsApp that led to its bottoms up appropriation, our study presents possibilities for educators and designers aiming to create technology enabled collaborative spaces between people otherwise hemmed in by social norms from reaching out to one another.","Social Media technology can reinforce harmful gender segregation in society, limiting opportunities for collaboration and communication between people of different genders.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702533,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Online Inspiration and Exploration for Identity Reinvention,"Self-representation online can be difficult for those who are in life transitions that involve exploring new identity facets and changes in personal style. Many desire to tailor their online representations for different audiences. Social media site profiles and sharing settings offer varying levels of anonymity, privacy, and thus safety, but these settings are often opaque and poorly understood. To understand the complex relationship between identity, personal style and online self-representation, we examine how people explore and experiment with new styles in public and in private online settings during gender transition. We present the results of interviews with transgender people who have recently reinvented their personal style, or are planning to do so in the near future. We find that people explore new styles in online settings to craft possible or ideal future selves. When involving others, people engage intimate and unknown others, but often avoid weak ties. Our results indicate that to account for changing identities, social media sites must be designed to support finding inspiration and advice from strangers and style experimentation with close friends.","Social media sites' opaque privacy settings can make it difficult for people to control their online representation, especially during life transitions or identity changes.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702270,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
MultiFi: Multi Fidelity Interaction with Displays On and Around the Body,"Display devices on and around the body such as smartwatches, head-mounted displays or tablets enable users to interact on the go. However, diverging input and output fidelities of these devices can lead to interaction seams that can inhibit efficient mobile interaction, when users employ multiple devices at once. We present MultiFi, an interactive system that combines the strengths of multiple displays and overcomes the seams of mobile interaction with widgets distributed over multiple devices. A comparative user study indicates that combined head-mounted display and smartwatch interfaces can outperform interaction with single wearable devices.",Interaction seams that can inhibit efficient mobile interaction when using multiple devices at once.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702331,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Repurposing Conversation: Experiments with the Continuous Speech Stream,"Voice interaction with mobile devices has been focused on hands-free interaction or situations where visual interfaces are not applicable. In this paper we explore a subtler means of interaction -- speech recognition from continual, in the background, audio recording of conversations. We call this the 'continuous speech stream' and explore how it could be repurposed as user input. We analyse ten days of recorded audio from our participants, alongside corresponding interviews, to explore how systems might make use of extracts from this stream. Rather than containing directly actionable items, our data suggests that the continuous speech stream is a rich resource for identifying users' next actions, along with the interests and dispositions of those being recorded. Through design workshops we explored new interactions using the speech stream, and describe concepts for individual, shared and distributed use.","

The technology can potentially invade privacy by constantly recording conversations in the background, even when the user is not actively interacting with the device.

The CADENCE Corpus: A New Resource for Inclusive Voice Interface Design,"Papers on voice interfaces for people with cognitive impairment or demenita only provide small snapshots of actual interactions, if at all. This is a major obstacle to the development of better interfaces. Transcripts of interactions between users and systems contain rich evidence of typical language patterns, indicate how users conceptualise their computer interlocutor, and highlight key design issues. In this paper, we introduce the CADENCE corpus and outline how it can be used to stimulate replicable research on inclusive voice interfaces. The CADENCE corpus is first data set of its kind to include rich data from people with cognitive impairment and free for research use. The corpus consists of transcribed spoken interactions between older people with and without cognitive impairment and a simulated Intelligent Cognitive Assistant and includes comprehensive data on users' cognitive abilities.","Lack of research on voice interfaces for people with cognitive impairment or dementia, resulting in limited understanding of how to design inclusive voice interfaces that meet their needs.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702372,Voice Assistant,CHI,health & well-being
Empirical Evidence for a Diminished Sense of Agency in Speech Interfaces,"While the technology underlying speech interfaces has improved in recent years, our understanding of the human side of speech interactions remains limited. This paper provides new insight on one important human aspect of speech interactions: the sense of agency - defined as the experience of controlling one's own actions and their outcomes. Two experiments are described. In each case a voice command is compared with keyboard input. Agency is measured using an implicit metric: intentional binding. In both experiments we find that participants' sense of agency is significantly reduced for voice commands as compared to keyboard input. This finding presents a fundamental challenge for the design of effective speech interfaces. We reflect on this finding and, based on current theory in HCI and cognitive neuroscience, offer possible explanations for the reduced sense of agency observed in speech interfaces.","Reduced sense of agency.

Voice Assistants can make people feel less in control of their actions and outcomes, compared to using a keyboard.

To Beep or Not to Beep?: Comparing Abstract versus Language-Based Multimodal Driver Displays,"Multimodal displays are increasingly being utilized as driver warnings. Abstract warnings, without any semantic association to the signified event, and language-based warnings are examples of such displays. This paper presents a first comparison between these two types, across all combinations of audio, visual and tactile modalities. Speech, text and Speech Tactons (a novel form of tactile warnings synchronous to speech) were compared to abstract pulses in two experiments. Results showed that recognition times of warning urgency during a non-critical driving situation were shorter for abstract warnings, highly urgent warnings and warnings including visual feedback. Response times during a critical situation were shorter for warnings including audio. We therefore suggest abstract visual feedback when informing drivers during a non-critical situation and audio in a highly critical one. Language-based warnings during a critical situation performed equally well as abstract ones, so they are suggested as less annoying vehicle alerts.",Voice Assistant technology may lead to slower response times during critical driving situations if the warnings are not appropriately tailored to the situation.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702167,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Inferring Employee Engagement from Social Media,"Employees increasingly are expressing ideas and feelings through enterprise social media. Recent work in CHI and CSCW has applied linguistic analysis towards understanding employee experiences. In this paper, we apply dictionary based linguistic analysis to measure 'Employee Engagement'. Employee engagement is a measure of employee willingness to apply discretionary effort towards organizational goals, and plays an important role in organizational outcomes such as financial or operational results. Organizations typically use surveys to measure engagement. This paper describes an approach to model employee engagement based on word choice in social media. This method can potentially complement surveys, thus providing more real-time insights into engagement and allowing organizations to address engagement issues faster. Our results predicting engagement scores on a survey by combining demographics with social media text demonstrate that social media text has significant predictive power compared to demographic data alone. We also find that engagement may be a state than a stable trait since social media posts closer to the administration of the survey had the most predictive power. We further identify the minimum number of social media posts required per employee for the best prediction.","Social media can be used to monitor and analyze employees' feelings and ideas, potentially invading their privacy and creating a sense of surveillance in the workplace.

"Mailing Lists: Why Are They Still Here, What's Wrong With Them, and How Can We Fix Them?","Mailing lists have existed since the early days of email and are still widely used today, even as more sophisticated online forums and social media websites proliferate. The simplicity of mailing lists can be seen as a reason for their endurance, a source of dissatisfaction, and an opportunity for improvement. Using a mixed-method approach, we studied two community mailing lists in depth with interviews and surveys, and surveyed a broader spectrum of 28 lists. We report how members of the different communities use their lists and their goals and desires for them. We explore why members prefer mailing lists to other group communication tools. But we also identify several tensions around mailing list usage that appear to contribute to dissatisfaction with them. We conclude with design implications, discussing ways to alleviate these tensions while preserving mailing lists' appeal.","Dissatisfaction with mailing lists due to tensions around usage, despite their endurance and simplicity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702194,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Generation Like: Comparative Characteristics in Instagram,"The emergence of social media has had a significant impact on how people communicate and socialize. Teens use social media to make and maintain social connections with friends and build their reputation. However, the way of analyzing the characteristics of teens in social media has mostly relied on ethnographic accounts or quantitative analyses with small datasets. This paper shows the possibility of detecting age information in user profiles by using a combination of textual and facial recognition methods and presents a comparative study of 27K teens and adults in Instagram. Our analysis highlights that (1) teens tend to post fewer photos but highly engage in adding more tags to their own photos and receiving more Likes and comments about their photos from others, and (2) to post more selfies and express themselves more than adults, showing a higher sense of self-representation. We demonstrate the application of our novel method that shows clear trends of age differences as well as substantiates previous insights in social media.","

"Piggyback Prototyping: Using Existing, Large-Scale Social Computing Systems to Prototype New Ones","We propose a technique we call piggyback prototyping, a prototyping mechanism for designing new social computing systems on top of existing ones. Traditional HCI prototyping techniques do not translate well to large social computing systems. To address this gap, we describe a 6-stage process for prototyping new social computing systems using existing online systems, such as Twitter or Facebook. This allows researchers to focus on what people do on their system rather than how to attract people to it. We illustrate this technique with an instantiation on Twitter to pair people who are different from each other in airports. Even though there were many missed meetings, 53% of survey respondents would be interested in being matched again, and eight people even met in person. Through piggyback prototyping, we gained insight into the future design of this system. We conclude the paper with considerations for privacy, consent, volume of users, and evaluation metrics.","

The article highlights the potential for missed connections and lack of in-person interactions when relying on social media for communication.

Situated Social Media Use: A Methodological Approach to Locating Social Media Practices and Trajectories,"In this paper we draw upon a number of explorations of social media activities, trying to capture and understand them as located, situated practices. This methodological endeavor spans over analyzing patterns in big data feeds (here Instagram) as well as small-scale video-based ethnographic studies of user activities. A situated social media perspective involves examining how social media production and consumption are intertwined. Drawing upon our studies of social media use in cultural institutions we show how visitors orient to their social media presence while attending to physical space during a visit, and how editing and sharing processes are formed by the trajectory through a space. We discuss the application and relevance of this approach for understanding social media and social photography in situ.","Social media use can distract people from fully experiencing and engaging with their physical surroundings, leading to a diminished appreciation of real-life moments and cultural institutions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702531,Social Media,CHI,user experience
CrowdMonitor: Mobile Crowd Sensing for Assessing Physical and Digital Activities of Citizens during Emergencies,"Emergencies such as the 2013 Central European flood or the 2013 typhoon Haiyan in Philippines have shown how citizens can organize themselves and coordinate private relief activities. These activities can be found in (physical) groups of affected people, but also within (digital) social media communities. There is an evident need, however, for a clearer picture of what exactly is going on to be available for use by the official emergency services: to enlist them, to keep them safe, to support their efforts and to avoid needless duplications or conflicts. Aligning emergency services and volunteer activities is, then, crucial. In this paper we present a mobile crowd sensing based concept, which was designed as well as implemented as the application CrowdMonitor and facilitates the detection of physical and digital activities and the assignment of specific tasks to citizens. Finally we outline the findings of its evaluation.","

XHELP: Design of a Cross-Platform Social-Media Application to Support Volunteer Moderators in Disasters,"Recent disasters have shown an increase in the significance of social media for both affected citizens and volunteers alike in the coordination of information and organization of relief activities, often independently of and in addition to the official emergency response. Existing research mainly focuses on the way in which individual platforms are used by volunteers in response to disasters. This paper examines the use of social media during the European Floods of 2013 and proposes a novel cross-social-media application for volunteers. Besides comprehensive analysis of volunteer communities, interviews were conducted with ""digital volunteers"" such as Facebook moderators of disaster-related groups. Based on the challenges identified, we designed and implemented the cross-social-media application ""XHELP"", which allows information to be both, acquired and distributed cross-media and cross-channel.

Building a Birds Eye View: Collaborative Work in Disaster Response,"Command and control environments ranging from transport control rooms to disaster response have long been of interest to HCI and CSCW as rich sites of interactive technology use embedded in work practice. Drawing on our engagement with disaster response teams, including ethnography of their training work, we unpack the ways in which situational uncertainty is managed while a shared operational 'picture' is constituted through various practices around tabletop work. Our analysis reveals how this picture is collaboratively assembled as a socially shared object and displayed by drawing on digital and physical resources. Accordingly, we provide a range of principles implicated by our study that guide the design of systems augmenting and enriching disaster response work practices. In turn, we propose the Augmented Bird Table to illustrate how our principles can be implemented to support tabletop work.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can lead to an over-reliance on technology and a loss of critical thinking skills in disaster response teams.

Insights from the article:

* Disaster response teams use technology to manage situational uncertainty and create a shared operational ""picture.""
* This picture is collaboratively assembled through various practices around tabletop work.
* The use of technology can lead to an over-reliance on digital and physical resources, potentially neglecting human judgment and critical thinking.

Concerns:

* Over-reliance on technology can lead to a loss of critical thinking skills in disaster response teams.
* Teams may become too dependent on technology and neglect human judgment, leading to poor decision-making in high-pressure situations.
* The use of technology can create a false sense of security, leading teams to overlook potential risks and vulnerabilities.

Recommendations:

* Ensure that technology is used to support human decision-making, rather than replacing it.
* Encourage disaster response teams to maintain a balance between technology use and human judgment.
* Provide training to teams on the appropriate use of technology in disaster response situations.

By considering the potential undesirable consequences of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology, we can design systems that support and enhance disaster response work practices while avoiding the pitfalls of over-reliance on technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702313,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being

The study features three groups, comparing manually adjustable exergames with the identical games in adaptive versions and manual physiotherapy interventions without games. The results indicate that the exergames and traditional therapy are comparable regarding measures of competence and enjoyment, while exergames led to significantly higher scores for autonomy, presence, and in a functional reach test. With traditional therapy, scores for tension-pressure and effort-importance were significantly higher.

Modeling Distant Pointing for Compensating Systematic Displacements,"Distant pointing at objects and persons is a highly expressive gesture that is widely used in human communication. Pointing is also used to control a range of interactive systems. For determining where a user is pointing at, different ray casting methods have been proposed. In this paper we assess how accurately humans point over distance and how to improve it. Participants pointed at projected targets from 2m and 3m while standing and sitting. Testing three common ray casting methods, we found that even with the most accurate one the average error is 61.3cm. We found that all tested ray casting methods are affected by systematic displacements. Therefore, we trained a polynomial to compensate this displacement. We show that using a user-, pose-, and distant-independent quartic polynomial can reduce the average error by 37.3%",Inaccurate pointing in AR/VR systems can lead to errors and frustration for users.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702332,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Is Moving Improving?: Some Effects of Locomotion in Wall-Display Interaction,"Physical movement plays an important role in interaction with wall-displays. Earlier work on its effect on performance has been inconclusive, however, because movement has not been experimentally controlled. In a first experiment, we controlled participants' ability to physically move in front of a 3-meter wide 24-megapixel wall-display. Participants performed a classification task involving navigation using a zoom-and-pan interface. Results suggest that the ability to move does not increase performance, and that a majority of participants used virtual navigation (i.e., zooming and panning) and little or no physical navigation (i.e., moving their bodies). To isolate the effects of physical and virtual navigation, a second experiment compared conditions where participants could navigate using either only physical movement or only virtual navigation. The second experiment showed that physical movement does benefit performance. The results from the experiments suggest that moving may not be improving performance, depending on the use of virtual navigation.","Over-reliance on virtual navigation instead of physical movement, which may negatively impact performance in certain tasks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2702123.2702312,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Stress and multitasking in everyday college life: an empirical study of online activity,"While HCI has focused on multitasking with information workers, we report on multitasking among Millennials who grew up with digital media - focusing on college students. We logged computer activity and used biosensors to measure stress of 48 students for 7 days for all waking hours, in their in situ environments. We found a significant positive relationship with stress and daily time spent on computers. Stress is positively associated with the amount of multitasking. Conversely, stress is negatively associated with Facebook and social media use. Heavy multitaskers use significantly more social media and report lower positive affect than light multitaskers. Night habits affect multitasking the following day: late-nighters show longer duration of computer use and those ending their activities earlier in the day multitask less. Our study shows that college students multitask at double the frequency compared to studies of information workers. These results can inform designs for stress management of college students.","Social media use is associated with increased stress levels and decreased positive emotions, particularly among heavy multitaskers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557361,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Reflection or action?: how feedback and control affect location sharing decisions,"Owing to the ever-expanding size of social and professional networks, it is becoming cumbersome for individuals to configure information disclosure settings. We used location sharing systems to unpack the nature of discrepancies between a person's disclosure settings and contextual choices. We conducted an experience sampling study (N = 35) to examine various factors contributing to such divergence. We found that immediate feedback about disclosures without any ability to control the disclosures evoked feelings of oversharing. Moreover, deviation from specified settings did not always signal privacy violation; it was just as likely that settings prevented information disclosure considered permissible in situ. We suggest making feedback more actionable or delaying it sufficiently to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. Our findings also make the case for proactive techniques for detecting potential mismatches and recommending adjustments to disclosure settings, as well as selective control when sharing location with socially distant recipients and visiting atypical locations.","Social media users may feel like they're oversharing information due to the lack of control over disclosure settings, leading to privacy violations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557121,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Effects of security warnings and instant gratification cues on attitudes toward mobile websites,"In order to address the increased privacy and security concerns raised by mobile communications, designers of mobile applications and websites have come up with a variety of warnings and appeals. While some interstitials warn about potential risk to personal information due to an untrusted security certificate, others attempt to take users' minds away from privacy concerns by making tempting, time-sensitive offers. How effective are they? We conducted an online experiment (N = 220) to find out. Our data show that both these strategies raise red flags for users - appeals to instant gratification make users more leery of the site and warnings make them perceive greater threat to personal data. Yet, users tend to reveal more information about their social media accounts when warned about an insecure site. This is probably because users process these interstitials based on cognitive heuristics triggered by them. These findings hold important implications for the design of cues in mobile interfaces.","Social media users may reveal more personal information when warned about an insecure site, due to cognitive biases triggered by the warning.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557347,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Social media participation and performance at work: a longitudinal study,"The use of social media at work is gaining traction, and there is evidence to suggest that various benefits accrue from its use. Yet the relationship between using social media at work and employee performance is not clear. Through a study of 75,747 employees of a large global company over the course of 3 years, we find that some social media usage (number of forum posts, forum post length, and status update length) was positively associated with performance ratings. This study is one of the first to show the relationship among different forms of social media use and employee performance ratings.","Social Media can be a distraction at work, leading to decreased productivity and negative impact on employee performance.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557417,Social Media,CHI,user experience
The doing of doing stuff: understanding the coordination of social group-activities,"This paper explores how the adoption of mobile and social computing technologies has impacted upon the way in which we coordinate social group-activities. We present a diary study of 36 individuals that provides an overview of how group coordination is currently performed as well as the challenges people face. Our findings highlight that people primarily use open-channel communication tools (e.g., text messaging, phone calls, email) to coordinate because the alternatives are seen as either disrupting or curbing to the natural conversational processes. Yet the use of open-channel tools often results in conversational overload and a significant disparity of work between coordinating individuals. This in turn often leads to a sense of frustration and confusion about coordination details. We discuss how the findings argue for a significant shift in our thinking about the design of coordination support systems.","Social Media technology can lead to conversational overload and a significant disparity of work between coordinating individuals, resulting in frustration and confusion.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557388,Social Media,CHI,user experience
"Necessary, unpleasant, and disempowering: reputation management in the internet age","In this paper, we report on a qualitative study of how users manage their reputation online. We focus particularly on people who are bothered by content online about themselves and how they manage reputation damage and repair. We describe how users view reputation management chores as necessary but unpleasant, and how they feel disempowered to repair their online reputation. Participants were unable to identify feasible repair mechanisms and ultimately failed to resolve their problems. Given the current state of dysfunction indicated by our findings, we advocate for increased HCI research attention to this area.","People feel disempowered to repair their online reputation when they find objectionable content about themselves online, and current repair mechanisms are inadequate.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557126,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
The use of surrounding visual context in handheld AR: device vs. user perspective rendering,"The magic lens paradigm, a commonly used descriptor for handheld Augmented Reality (AR), presents the user with dual views: the augmented view (magic lens) that appears on the device, and the real view of the surroundings (what the user can see around the perimeter of the device). The augmented view is typically implemented by rendering the video captured by the rear-facing camera directly onto the device's screen. This results in dual perspectives - the real world being captured from the device's perspective rather than the user's perspective (what an observer would see looking through a transparent glass pane). These differences manifest themselves in misaligned and/or incorrectly scaled transparency resulting in the dual-view problem. This paper presents two user studies comparing (a) device-perspective and (b) fixed Point-of-View (POV) user-perspective magic lenses to analyze the effect of the dual-view problem on the use of the surrounding visual context. The results confirm that the dual-view problem, a result of dual perspective, has a significant effect on the use of information from the surrounding visual context. The study also highlights that magnification and not the dual-view problem is the key factor explaining the correlation between magic lens size and the increased intensity of the magic lens type effect. From the results, we derive design guidelines for future magic lenses.","Dual perspectives in Augmented Reality technology can cause misaligned and incorrectly scaled transparency, leading to the ""dual-view problem"" which can significantly affect the user's ability to use information from the surrounding visual context.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557125,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Altering gameplay behavior using stereoscopic 3D vision-based video game design,"We explore the potential of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) vision in offering distinct gameplay using an S3D-specific game called Deepress3D. Our game utilizes established S3D design principles for optimizing GUI design, visual comfort and game mechanics which rely on depth perception in time-pressured spatial conflicts. The game collects detailed S3D player metrics and allows players to choose between different, evenly matched strategies. We conducted a between subjects study comparing S3D and monoscopic versions of Deepress3D that examined player behavior and performance and measured user-reported data on presence, simulator sickness, and game experience. Confirming previous results, stereo users reported higher spatial presence. More importantly, for the first time, our game metrics indicate that S3D vision can measurably change player behavior depending on actual game content and level design, without necessarily affecting performance or emotional experience. These findings indicate the potential for optimizing applications for stereo users distinguishing them as a distinct group in HCI research.","

The use of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) vision in video games can lead to changes in player behavior, depending on the game content and level design, without affecting performance or emotional experience. This could result in players becoming too reliant on the technology and losing the ability to distinguish between virtual and real-world environments.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557283,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Depth perception with gaze-contingent depth of field,"Blur in images can create the sensation of depth because it emulates an optical property of the eye; namely, the limited depth of field created by the eye's lens. When the human eye looks at an object, this object appears sharp on the retina, but objects at different distances appear blurred. Advances in gaze-tracking technologies enable us to reproduce dynamic depth of field in regular displays, providing an alternative way of conveying depth. In this paper we investigate gaze-contingent depth of field as a method to produce realistic 3D images, and analyze how effectively people can use it to perceive depth. We found that GC DOF increases subjective perceived realism and depth and can contribute to the perception of ordinal depth and distance between objects, but it is limited in its accuracy.","

Imperceptible depth shifts for touch interaction with stereoscopic objects,"While touch technology has proven its usability for 2D interaction and has already become a standard input modality for many devices, the challenges to exploit its applicability with stereoscopically rendered content have barely been studied. In this paper we exploit the properties of the visual perception to allow users to touch stereoscopically displayed objects when the input is constrained to a 2D surface. Therefore, we have extended and generalized recent evaluations on the user's ability to discriminate small induced object shifts while reaching out to touch a virtual object, and we propose a practical interaction technique, the attracting shift technique, suitable for numerous application scenarios where shallow depth interaction is sufficient. In addition, our results indicate that slight object shifts during touch interaction make the virtual scene appear perceptually more stable compared to a static scene. As a consequence, applications have to manipulate the virtual objects to make them appear static for the user.","

Users may experience visual instability and discomfort when interacting with virtual objects in 3D space using 2D touch input, due to the limitations of the human visual perception system. This can lead to a decrease in the overall user experience and potentially cause eye strain or headaches.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557134,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Fostering social capital in economically distressed communities,"Past Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literature suggests that engaging in meaningful activities with ICTs may be related to socio-economic security, social inclusion, empowerment, and increased social capital. However, we identify a pervasive lack of understanding in existing literature, which raises an important research question: how can we build social capital where little social capital exists? We conducted a preliminary study to explore whether and if so, how, individuals in an economically distressed population with limited social capital use technologies to increase social capital and achieve socio-economic security. We contribute details about barriers affecting social capital (e.g., difficulties finding and making the right connections and an overall lack of trust within communities). We also suggest ways in which ICTs can assist populations that could benefit most from increased social capital and economic security.","Difficulty in building social capital and trust within communities, especially in economically distressed populations, due to limited access to technology and lack of understanding of how to effectively use it.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557123,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Show me the money!: an analysis of project updates during crowdfunding campaigns,"Hundreds of thousands of crowdfunding campaigns have been launched, but more than half of them have failed. To better understand the factors affecting campaign outcomes, this paper targets the content and usage patterns of project updates -- communications intended to keep potential funders aware of a campaign's progress. We analyzed the content and usage patterns of a large corpus of project updates on Kickstarter, one of the largest crowdfunding platforms. Using semantic analysis techniques, we derived a taxonomy of the types of project updates created during campaigns, and found discrepancies between the design intent of a project update and the various uses in practice (e.g. social promotion). The analysis also showed that specific uses of updates had stronger associations with campaign success than the project's description. Design implications were formulated from the results to help designers better support various uses of updates in crowdfunding campaigns.","

Simplifying orientation measurement for mobile audio augmented reality applications,"Audio augmented reality systems overlay the physical world with a virtual audio space. Today's smartphones provide enough processing power to create the impression of virtual sound sources being located in the real world. To achieve this, information about the user's location and orientation is necessary which requires additional hardware. In a real-world installation, however, we observed that instead of turning their head to localize sounds, users tend to turn their entire body. Therefore, we suggest to simply measure orientation of the user's body - or even just the mobile device she is holding - to generate the spatial audio. To verify this approach, we present two studies: Our first study in examines the user's head, body, and mobile device orientation when moving through an audio augmented reality system in a lab setting. Our second study analyzes the user experience in a real-world installation when using head, body, or device orientation to control the audio spatialization. We found that when navigating close to sound sources head tracking is necessary, but that it can potentially be replaced by device tracking in larger or more explorative usage scenarios. These findings help reduce the technical complexity of mobile audio augmented reality systems (MAARS), and enable their wider dissemination as mobile software-only apps.","Over-reliance on technology and decreased spatial awareness. Users may become too dependent on technology to navigate their surroundings, leading to a decrease in their ability to localize sounds and navigate their environment independently.

Visual recognition in museum guide apps: do visitors want it?,"In this paper, visual recognition (VisRec) is evaluated as a method to access background information on artworks in mobile museum guide applications (apps) by means of a field experiment. While museums and previous research have explored technical aspects, it is unclear whether visitors actually want to use VisRec. A prototype featuring VisRec, QR codes and number codes was developed and assessed with a usability study in two museums (N=89). The prototype confirms the efficacy of the recently introduced ORB-algorithm for VisRec. Compared to previous literature, the results highlight the context-dependency of perceived usability and variability in the importance of usability factors. The results reveal a clear preference for VisRec among participants (53%); only 14% preferred QR codes. Ease of use, enjoyability and distance are identified as the main factors. This provides strong evidence to further explore the potential of VisRec to improve visitors' museum experiences.","

Staccato social support in mobile health applications,"Social support plays an important role in health systems. While significant work has explored the role of social support in CMC environments, less analysis has considered social support in mobile health systems. This paper describes socially supportive messages in VERA, a mobile application for sharing health decisions and behaviors. The short and bursty interactions in social awareness streams [36] afford a particular style of social support, for which we offer the label staccato social support. Results indicate that, in comparison to previous work, staccato social support is characterized by a greater prevalence of esteem support, which builds respect and confidence. We further note the presence of 'following up', a positive behavior that contributes to supportive interactions, likely via social pressure and accountability [7,38]. These findings suggest design recommendations to developers of mobile social support systems and contribute to understanding technologically mediated social support for health.","Social Media can lead to a lack of meaningful social interactions and support, as people rely on brief and superficial exchanges that do not provide the same level of emotional support as in-person interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557297,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Giving up Twitter for Lent: how and why we take breaks from social media,"Social media use is widespread, but many people worry about overuse. This paper explores how and why people take breaks from social media. Using a mixed methods approach, we pair data from users who tweeted about giving up Twitter for Lent with an interview study of social media users. We find that 64% of users who proclaim that they are giving up Twitter for Lent successfully do so. Among those who fail, 31% acknowledge their failure; the other 69% simply return. We observe hedging patterns (e.g. ""I thought about giving up Twitter for Lent but""?) that surfaced uncertainty about social media behavior. Interview participants were concerned about the tradeoffs of spending time on social media versus doing other things and of spending time on social media rather than in ""real life."" We discuss gaps in related theory that might help reduce users' anxieties and open design problems related to designing systems and services that can help users manage their own social media use.","Social media overuse and anxiety.

Global connectivity and multilinguals in the Twitter network,"This article analyzes the global connectivity of the Twitter retweet and mentions network and the role of multilingual users engaging with content in multiple languages. The network is heavily structured by language with most mentions and retweets directed to users writing in the same language. Users writing in multiple languages are more active, authoring more tweets than monolingual users. These multilingual users play an important bridging role in the global connectivity of the network. The mean level of insularity from speakers in each language does not correlate straightforwardly with the size of the user base as predicted by previous research. Finally, the English language does play more of a bridging role than other languages, but the role played collectively by multilingual users across different languages is the largest bridging force in the network.","Social media platforms like Twitter can create language barriers and segregate users based on their language, leading to a lack of diversity and inclusivity in online interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557203,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Effects of public vs. private automated transcripts on multiparty communication between native and non-native english speakers,"Real-time transcripts generated by automated speech recognition (ASR) technologies have the potential to facilitate communication between native speakers (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS). Previous studies of ASR have focused on how transcripts aid NNS speech comprehension. In this study, we examine whether transcripts benefit multiparty real-time conversation between NS and NNS. We hypothesized that ASR transcripts would be more beneficial when the transcripts were publicly shared by all group members as opposed to when they were seen only by the NNS. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a lab experiment in which 14 groups of native and non-native speakers engaged in a story-telling task. Half of the groups received private transcripts that were available only to the NNS; the other half received publicly shared transcripts that were available to all group members. NS spoke more clearly, and both NS and NNS rated the quality of communication higher, when transcripts were publicly shared. These findings inform the design of future tools to support multilingual group communication.","

The use of real-time transcripts generated by automated speech recognition (ASR) technologies in multiparty conversations may lead to a decrease in the quality of communication between native and non-native speakers, as the transcripts may not accurately reflect the nuances of speech and may cause confusion or misinterpretation.

Visualizing dynamic networks with matrix cubes,"Designing visualizations of dynamic networks is challenging, both because the data sets tend to be complex and because the tasks associated with them are often cognitively demand- ing. We introduce the Matrix Cube, a novel visual representation and navigation model for dynamic networks, inspired by the way people comprehend and manipulate physical cubes. Users can change their perspective on the data by rotating or decomposing the 3D cube. These manipulations can produce a range of different 2D visualizations that emphasize specific aspects of the dynamic network suited to particular analysis tasks. We describe Matrix Cubes and the interactions that can be performed on them in the Cubix system. We then show how two domain experts, an astronomer and a neurologist, used Cubix to explore and report on their own network data.","

The Matrix Cube, a novel visual representation and navigation model for dynamic networks, can be challenging to use for people who are not familiar with 3D visualizations, potentially leading to confusion and frustration.

KnowMe and ShareMe: understanding automatically discovered personality traits from social media and user sharing preferences,"There is much recent work on using the digital footprints left by people on social media to predict personal traits and gain a deeper understanding of individuals. Due to the veracity of social media, imperfections in prediction algorithms, and the sensitive nature of one's personal traits, much research is still needed to better understand the effectiveness of this line of work, including users' preferences of sharing their computationally derived traits. In this paper, we report a two- part study involving 256 participants, which (1) examines the feasibility and effectiveness of automatically deriving three types of personality traits from Twitter, including Big 5 personality, basic human values, and fundamental needs, and (2) investigates users' opinions of using and sharing these traits. Our findings show there is a potential feasibility of automatically deriving one's personality traits from social media with various factors impacting the accuracy of models. The results also indicate over 61.5% users are willing to share their derived traits in the workplace and that a number of factors significantly influence their sharing preferences. Since our findings demonstrate the feasibility of automatically inferring a user's personal traits from social media, we discuss their implications for designing a new generation of privacy-preserving, hyper-personalized systems.","

Faces engage us: photos with faces attract more likes and comments on Instagram,"Photos are becoming prominent means of communication online. Despite photos' pervasive presence in social media and online world, we know little about how people interact and engage with their content. Understanding how photo content might signify engagement, can impact both science and design, influencing production and distribution. One common type of photo content that is shared on social media, is the photos of people. From studies of offline behavior, we know that human faces are powerful channels of non-verbal communication. In this paper, we study this behavioral phenomena online. We ask how presence of a face, it's age and gender might impact social engagement on the photo. We use a corpus of 1 million Instagram images and organize our study around two social engagement feedback factors, likes and comments. Our results show that photos with faces are 38% more likely to receive likes and 32% more likely to receive comments, even after controlling for social network reach and activity. We find, however, that the number of faces, their age and gender do not have an effect. This work presents the first results on how photos with human faces relate to engagement on large scale image sharing communities. In addition to contributing to the research around online user behavior, our findings offer a new line of future work using visual analysis.","Social media platforms' emphasis on visual content, such as photos, can lead to a focus on superficial interactions and a lack of engagement with meaningful content.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557403,Social Media,CHI,user experience

We found that in most evaluations users could not reach consensus on which video had better content as their perceptions tend to be very subjective. Nevertheless, when consensus was reached, the video with preferred content almost always achieved greater popularity on YouTube, highlighting the importance of content in driving information popularity on social media.","Social media platforms prioritize content that is attention-grabbing and sensational, rather than informative or accurate.

Vulture: a mid-air word-gesture keyboard,"Word-gesture keyboards enable fast text entry by letting users draw the shape of a word on the input surface. Such keyboards have been used extensively for touch devices, but not in mid-air, even though their fluent gestural input seems well suited for this modality. We present Vulture, a word-gesture keyboard for mid-air operation. Vulture adapts touch based word-gesture algorithms to work in mid-air, projects users' movement onto the display, and uses pinch as a word delimiter. A first 10-session study suggests text-entry rates of 20.6 Words Per Minute (WPM) and finds hand-movement speed to be the primary predictor of WPM. A second study shows that with training on a few phrases, participants do 28.1 WPM, 59% of the text-entry rate of direct touch input. Participants' recall of trained gestures in mid-air was low, suggesting that visual feedback is important but also limits performance. Based on data from the studies, we discuss improvements to Vulture and some alternative designs for mid-air text entry.","

In this paper, we present the results of the first comprehensive study on Finger-Count menus to investigate its usefulness as a viable option for 3D menu selection tasks. Our study compares 3D gesture-based finger counting (Finger Count menus) with two gesture-based menu selection techniques (Hand-n-Hold, Thumbs-Up), derived from existing motion-controlled video game menu selection strategies, as well as 3D Marking menus. We examined selection time, selection accuracy and user preference for all techniques. We also examined the impact of different spatial layouts for menu items and different menu depths. Our results indicate that Finger-Count menus are significantly faster than the other menu techniques we tested and are the most liked by participants.

Coming in from the margins: amateur musicians in the online age,"HCI is increasingly interested in amateurism, but the wider literature suggests that the amateur is a complex and distinctive phenomenon. An interview study reveals the nature of the amateur in the digital age. Even though operating non-professionally at a micro-scale, amateur musicians employ a plethora of online services to sustain local fanbases, reach out to new fans, collaborate internationally, and actively promote both digital and material products. Our findings lead to recommendations for event-oriented promotion tools; community-oriented analytics; tangible and embedded products; and limited-edition digital experiences. We conclude that HCI needs to recognise the amateur as an important class of user, one who is serious about their leisure, and who is also distinct from the professional as from the novice and hobbyist.","Amateur musicians are using online services to promote their music, but this can lead to a lack of recognition and compensation for their work, as they are not considered professionals.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557298,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Streaming on twitch: fostering participatory communities of play within live mixed media,"Previously, video streaming sites were at the fringes of online social media. In the past two years, live streams of video games, on sites such as Twitch.tv, have become very popular. Live streams serve as meeting grounds for player communities. The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with open IRC chat channels. In conjunction with gameplay, viewer participation and community building gain emphasis. Twitch streams range in size and nature, from intimate communities with fifty viewers, to massive broadcasts with tens of thousands. In this paper, we present an ethnographic investigation of the live streaming of video games on Twitch. We find that Twitch streams act as virtual third places, in which informal communities emerge, socialize, and participate. Over time, stream communities form around shared identities drawn from streams? contents and participants? shared experiences. We describe processes through which stream communities form, the motivations of members, and emergent issues in the medium. Finally, we draw from our findings to derive implications for design of live mixed-media environments to support participatory online communities.","Social isolation. People may spend too much time watching live streams and interacting with virtual communities, leading to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and a loss of connection with the physical world.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557048,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Estimating county health statistics with twitter,"Understanding the relationships among environment, behavior, and health is a core concern of public health researchers. While a number of recent studies have investigated the use of social media to track infectious diseases such as influenza, little work has been done to determine if other health concerns can be inferred. In this paper, we present a large-scale study of 27 health-related statistics, including obesity, health insurance coverage, access to healthy foods, and teen birth rates. We perform a linguistic analysis of the Twitter activity in the top 100 most populous counties in the U.S., and find a significant correlation with 6 of the 27 health statistics. When compared to traditional models based on demographic variables alone, we find that augmenting models with Twitter-derived information improves predictive accuracy for 20 of 27 statistics, suggesting that this new methodology can complement existing approaches.","Social media can be used to track health concerns, but it can also be used to infer other health issues, such as obesity, health insurance coverage, and teen birth rates, without users' knowledge or consent.

Unraveling abstinence and relapse: smoking cessation reflected in social media,"Analysis of smokers' posts and behaviors on Twitter reveals factors impacting abstinence and relapse during cessation attempts. Combining automatic and crowdsourced techniques, we detect users trying to quit smoking and analyze tweet and network data from a sample of 653 individuals over a two-year window of quitting. Guided by theory and practice, we derive behavioral, social, and emotional measures to compare users who abstain and relapse. We also examine the cessation process, demonstrating that Twitter can help chronicle how some people go about quitting. Among other results, we show that those who fail in their smoking cessation are far heavier posters and use relatively less positive language, while those who succeed are more social in both network ties and in directed communication. We conclude with insights on how intelligent intervention systems can harness these signals to provide tailored behavior change support.","Social Media can be addictive and hinder smoking cessation attempts. Those who fail in quitting smoking use Social Media more frequently and have a more negative outlook, while successful quitters are more social and have a more positive attitude. Intelligent intervention systems can be used to provide tailored support for behavior change, but may also contribute to addiction.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557145,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Seeking and sharing health information online: comparing search engines and social media,"Search engines and social media are two of the most com-monly used online services; in this paper, we examine how users appropriate these platforms for online health activi-ties via both large-scale log analysis and a survey of 210 people. While users often turn to search engines to learn about serious or highly stigmatic conditions, a surprising amount of sensitive health information is also sought and shared via social media, in our case the public social plat-form Twitter. We contrast what health content people seek via search engines vs. share on social media, as well as why they choose a particular platform for online health activi-ties. We reflect on the implications of our results for design-ing search engines, social media, and social search tools that better support people's health information seeking and sharing needs.","

Comparing flat and spherical displays in a trust scenario in avatar-mediated interaction,"We report on two experiments that investigate the influence of display type and viewing angle on how people place their trust during avatar-mediated interaction. By monitoring advice seeking behavior, our first experiment demonstrates that if participants observe an avatar at an oblique viewing angle on a flat display, they are less able to discriminate between expert and non-expert advice than if they observe the avatar face-on. We then introduce a novel spherical display and a ray-traced rendering technique that can display an avatar that can be seen correctly from any viewing direction. We expect that a spherical display has advantages over a flat display because it better supports non-verbal cues, particularly gaze direction, since it presents a clear and undistorted viewing aspect at all angles. Our second experiment compares the spherical display to a flat display. Whilst participants can discriminate expert advice regardless of display, a negative bias towards the flat screen emerges at oblique viewing angles. This result emphasizes the ability of the spherical display to be viewed qualitatively similarly from all angles. Together the experiments demonstrate how trust can be altered depending on how one views the avatar.","People may have difficulty discriminating between expert and non-expert advice when viewing an avatar at an oblique angle on a flat display, leading to a negative bias towards the flat screen.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557276,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Communiplay: a field study of a public display mediaspace,"We present Communiplay, a public display media space. People passing by see their own contour mirrored on a public display and can start to play with virtual objects. At the same time, they see others playing at remote displays within the same virtual space. We are interested whether people would use such a public display media space, and if so, how and why. We evaluate Communiplay in a field study in six connected locations and find a remote honey-pot effect, i.e. people interacting at one location attract people at other locations. The conversion rate (percentage of passers-by starting to interact) rose by +136% when people saw others playing at remote locations. We also provide the first quantification of the (local) honey-pot effect (in our case it raised the conversion rate by +604% when people saw others playing at the same location). We conclude that the integration of multiple public displays into a media space is a promising direction for public displays and can make them more attractive and valuable.","People may become too engrossed in virtual reality, neglecting their surroundings and interactions with real people.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557001,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
I can wait a minute: uncovering the optimal delay time for pre-moderated user-generated content on public displays,"Public displays have advanced from isolated and non interactive ""ad"" displays which show images and videos to displays that are networked, interactive, and open to a wide variety of content and applications. Prior work has shown large potential of user-generated content on public displays. However, one of the problems with user-generated content on public displays is moderation as content may be explicit or troublesome for a particular location. In this work we explore the expectations of users with regard to content moderation on public displays. An online survey revealed that people not only think that display content should be moderated but also that a delay of up to 10 minutes is acceptable if display content is moderated. In a subsequent in the wild deployment we compared different moderation delays. We found that a moderation delay significantly decreases the number of user-generated posts while at the same time there is no significant effect on users' decision to repeatedly post on the display.","Social Media technology may lead to inappropriate or offensive content being displayed in public spaces, which can be harmful or uncomfortable for some individuals.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557186,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Design patterns for exploring and prototyping human-robot interactions,"Robotic products are envisioned to offer rich interactions in a range of environments. While their specific roles will vary across applications, these products will draw on fundamental building blocks of interaction, such as greeting people, narrating information, providing instructions, and asking and answering questions. In this paper, we explore how such building blocks might serve as interaction design patterns that enable design exploration and prototyping for human-robot interaction. To construct a pattern library, we observed human interactions across different scenarios and identified seven patterns, such as question-answer pairs. We then designed and implemented Interaction Blocks, a visual authoring environment that enabled prototyping of robot interactions using these patterns. Design sessions with designers and developers demonstrated the promise of using a pattern language for designing robot interactions, confirmed the usability of our authoring environment, and provided insights into future research on tools for human-robot interaction design.","

Upvoting hurricane Sandy: event-based news production processes on a social news site,"This paper uses the case of Hurricane Sandy and reddit's topical community (subreddit) /r/sandy to examine the production and curation of news content around events on a social news site. Through qualitative analysis, we provide a coded topology of produced content and describe how types of networked gatekeeping impact the framing of a crisis situation. This study also examines, through quantitative modeling, what kind of information becomes negotiated and voted as relevant. We suggest that highly scored content shared in a social news setting focused more on human-interest media and perspective-based citizen journalism than professional news reports. We conclude by discussing how the mechanisms of social news sites conflict with the social norms and culture of reddit to produce differing expectations around news.","Social media platforms like reddit prioritize human-interest stories and citizen journalism over professional news reports, leading to a skewed perspective of events.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557140,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Online public communications by police & fire services during the 2012 Hurricane Sandy,"Social media and other online communication tools are a subject of great interest in mass emergency response. Members of the public are turning to these solutions to seek and offer emergency information. Emergency responders are working to determine what social media policies should be in terms of their ""public information"" functions. We report on the online communications from all the coastal fire and police departments within a 100 mile radius of Hurricane Sandy's US landfall. Across four types of online communication media, we collected data from 840 fire and police departments. Findings indicate that few departments used these online channels in their Sandy response efforts, and that communications differed between fire and police departments and across media type. However, among the highly engaged departments, there is evidence that they bend and adapt policies about what constitutes appropriate public communication in the face of emergency demands; therefore, we propose that flexibility is important in considering future emergency online communication policy. We conclude with design recommendations for making online communication media more ""listenable"" for both emergency managers and members of the public.","Social media can be unreliable during emergencies.

The article states that few departments used social media in their response efforts during Hurricane Sandy, and communications differed between fire and police departments and across media type. This suggests that social media may not be a reliable means of communication during emergencies, and that it may not be suitable for critical information dissemination. Additionally, the article highlights the need for flexibility in considering future emergency online communication policy, implying that social media policies may need to be adaptable to changing circumstances.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557227,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
SmartVoice: a presentation support system for overcoming the language barrier,"In most cases, speeches or presentations at an international event are required to be given in a common language (e.g. English). However, for people who are not proficient in that common language, delivering presentations fluently is very difficult. Simultaneous translation seems to be a solution, but besides its high cost, simultaneous translation undermines the nature of the presentation by substituting the real voice of the lecturer as well as his/her emotions. In this paper, we propose ""SmartVoice"", a presentation support system, which aims to overcome language barriers. By tracking the lip motion of the lecturer, SmartVoice controls the playback of the narration, which is a sound data prepared in advance or created automatically using a voice synthesizer. SmartVoice also controls the intonation of the sound based on the position and shape of the lecturer's mouth. As the lecturer can talk at his/her own pace with the voice automatically following, it appears as if he/she talks in his/her own voice. In our user evaluation, we confirmed that audiences find it difficult to distinguish between the narration generated by SmartVoice and that by a real voice. We also discuss the possibility of applying SmartVoice to fields other than multi-language presentation support, such as Automated Dialogue Replacement and language study.","

The use of SmartVoice, a presentation support system that uses a voice synthesizer to mimic the lecturer's voice, may lead to a loss of authenticity and originality in presentations. The system's reliance on pre-recorded or automatically generated sound data may result in a lack of spontaneity and naturalness in the lecturer's delivery, potentially undermining the impact and credibility of the presentation. Additionally, the use of a synthesized voice may also lead to a sense of detachment or disconnection between the lecturer and the audience, as the lecturer's real voice and emotions are not being conveyed.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557161,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Supporting treatment of people living with HIV / AIDS in resource limited settings with IVRs,"We developed an interactive voice response (IVR) system called TAMA (Treatment Advice by Mobile Alerts) that provides treatment support to people living with HIV / AIDS (PLHA) in developing countries, who are on antiret-roviral therapy (ART). We deployed TAMA with 54 PLHA in 5 HIV clinics in India for a period of 12 weeks. During the study, we gathered feedback about TAMA's design and usage. Additionally, we conducted detailed qualitative interviews and analysed usage logs. We found that TAMA was usable and viable in the real life settings of PLHA and it had many desirable effects on their treatment adherence. We developed insights that inform the design of TAMA and some of these can be generalised to design of other long-term, frequent-use IVR applications for users in developing countries in the healthcare domain and beyond.","

* Technical issues: The system may experience technical difficulties or errors, which could impact its effectiveness and user satisfaction.
* Privacy concerns: Users may be concerned about the privacy of their personal information, especially in a resource-constrained setting where data security may not be robust.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557236,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
What did spot hide?: a question-answering game for preschool children,"Early literacy is critical to child development, and determines a child's later educational and life opportunities. Moreover, preschool children are incessantly inquisitive, and will readily engage in question answering and asking activities if given the opportunity. We argue here that question asking/answering technologies can play a major role in early literacy. We describe the design and evaluation of a conversational agent called Spot, with the goal of engaging children in a 20-questions game. Towards this goal, we conducted a feasibility study to determine if children's questions are ""on-topic"" and suitable for ASR/dialogue systems. We evaluated Spot's performance at conducting a game of 20-questions against that of a human partner.","

Establishing design guidelines in interactive exercise gaming: preliminary data from two posing studies,"Interactive gaming has demonstrated promise as a low-cost, at-home training and fitness instruction alternative. Gaming systems offer convenience and the ability to provide enhanced reporting and progress data if body measurement information is collected effectively. However, commercially available systems today are designed primarily for entertainment and as a result, the quality of instruction delivery and level of involvement may not meet the needs of a user performing a disciplined activity. This paper will look at adapting for occlusion and lack of visibility; learning and orientation; and providing feedback in an effort to determine if there is an ideal visual demonstration delivery that maximizes pose understanding and user self-efficacy, determine whether supplementary modalities are important for instruction, and determine if there is an ideal feedback delivery that promotes pose comprehension, confidence and motivation.

History assisted view authoring for 3D models,"3D modelers often wish to showcase their models for sharing or review purposes. This may consist of generating static viewpoints of the model or authoring animated fly-throughs. Manually creating such views is often tedious and few automatic methods are designed to interactively assist the modelers with the view authoring process. We present a view authoring assistance system that supports the creation of informative view points, view paths, and view surfaces, allowing modelers to author the interactive navigation experience of a model. The key concept of our implementation is to analyze the model's workflow history, to infer important regions of the model and representative viewpoints of those areas. An evaluation indicated that the viewpoints generated by our algorithm are comparable to those manually selected by the modeler. In addition, participants of a user study found our system easy to use and effective for authoring viewpoint summaries.","

The use of automated view authoring systems for 3D models can lead to a loss of creative control and originality in the presentation of the models, as the algorithm-generated views may become the standard and preferred way of showcasing the model, rather than allowing the modeler to manually create unique and personalized views. This could result in a homogenization of 3D model presentations and limit the potential for innovative and artistic expression.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557009,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
FrameBox and MirrorBox: tools and guidelines to support designers in prototyping interfaces for 3D displays,"In this paper, we identify design guidelines for stereoscopic 3D (S3D) user interfaces (UIs) and present the MirrorBox and the FrameBox, two UI prototyping tools for S3D displays. As auto-stereoscopy becomes available for the mass market we believe the design of S3D UIs for devices, for example, mobile phones, public displays, or car dashboards, will rapidly gain importance. A benefit of such UIs is that they can group and structure information in a way that makes them easily perceivable for the user. For example, important information can be shown in front of less important information. This paper identifies core requirements for designing S3D UIs and derives concrete guidelines. The requirements also serve as a basis for two depth layout tools we built with the aim to overcome limitations of traditional prototyping when sketching S3D UIs. We evaluated the tools with usability experts and compared them to traditional paper prototyping.","

The development of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) user interfaces (UIs) for devices such as mobile phones, public displays, or car dashboards may lead to a decrease in the ability to distinguish between what is real and what is virtual. This could result in a blurring of the lines between reality and virtual reality, potentially leading to confusion, disorientation, and accidents. Additionally, the ability to group and structure information in a way that makes it easily perceivable for the user may lead to an over-reliance on technology and a decrease in critical thinking skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557183,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

Learning to see the body: supporting instructional practices in laparoscopic surgical procedures,"Learning the practices and the performance of physically manipulating instruments in minimally invasive surgeries is an impetus for the development of surgical training simulators. However, an often-overlooked aspect of surgical training is learning how to see the body through the various imaging mechanisms. With this study, we address the ways in which surgeons demonstrate and instruct residents in seeing the body during minimally invasive surgical procedures. Drawing on observations and analysis of video recordings of minimally invasive surgical operations, we examine how particular anatomy and movement within the body to see and conceptualize that anatomy are made visible by the instructive practices of the surgeon. We use these findings to discuss further directions for minimally invasive surgical training through mechanisms for making the body visible during situated surgical training and surgical training simulation systems.","

@BabySteps: design and evaluation of a system for using twitter for tracking children's developmental milestones,"The tracking of developmental milestones in young children is an important public health goal for ensuring early detection and treatment for developmental delay. While numerous paper-based and web-based solutions are available for tracking milestones, many busy parents often forget to enter information on a regular basis. To help address this need, we have developed an interactive system called @BabySteps for allowing parents who use Twitter to track and respond to tweets about developmental milestones using a special hashtag syntax. Parent responses are parsed automatically and written into a central database that can be accessed via the web. We deployed @BabySteps with 14 parents over a 3-week period and found that parents were able to learn how to use the system to track their children's progress, with some using it to communicate with other parents. The study helped to identify a number of ways to improve the approach, including simplifying the hashtag syntax, allowing for private responses via direct messaging, and improving the social component. We provide a discussion of lessons learned and suggestions for the design of interactive public health systems.","

The use of Twitter for tracking developmental milestones in young children can lead to a lack of privacy and security for sensitive information.

We implemented and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week field trial with 28 Facebook users. We analyzed participants' interactions with the nudges, the content of their posts, and opinions collected through surveys. We found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden; however, introducing a time delay before publishing users' posts can be perceived as both beneficial and annoying. On balance, some participants found the nudges helpful while others found them unnecessary or overly intrusive.

In situ with bystanders of augmented reality glasses: perspectives on recording and privacy-mediating technologies,"Augmented reality (AR) devices are poised to enter the market. It is unclear how the properties of these devices will affect individuals' privacy. In this study, we investigate the privacy perspectives of individuals when they are bystanders around AR devices. We conducted 12 field sessions in cafés and interviewed 31 bystanders regarding their reactions to a co-located AR device. Participants were predominantly split between having indifferent and negative reactions to the device. Participants who expressed that AR devices change the bystander experience attributed this difference to subtleness, ease of recording, and the technology's lack of prevalence. Additionally, participants surfaced a variety of factors that make recording more or less acceptable, including what they are doing when the recording is being taken. Participants expressed interest in being asked permission before being recorded and in recording-blocking devices.

Curation through use: understanding the personal value of social media,"Content generation on social network sites has been considered mainly from the perspective of individuals interacting with social network contacts. Yet research has also pointed to the potential for social media to become a meaningful personal archive over time. The aim of this paper is to consider how social media, over time and across sites, forms part of the wider digital archiving space for individuals. Our findings, from a qualitative study of 14 social media users, highlight how although some sites are more associated with 'keepable' social media than others, even those are not seen as archives in the usual sense of the word. We show how this perception is bound up with five contradictions, which center on social media as curated, as a reliable repository of meaningful content, as readily encountered and as having the potential to present content as a compelling narrative. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for design relating to curation through use and what this implies for personal digital archives, which are known to present difficulties in terms of curation and re-finding.","Social media platforms are not reliable repositories of meaningful content, and their curation and archiving can be problematic, leading to difficulties in preserving personal digital archives.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557291,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Together alone: motivations for live-tweeting a television series,"In this paper, we explore motivations for live-tweeting across a season of a television show. Using the third season of Downton Abbey as a case study, we followed 2,234 live-tweeters from the show's premiere episode to its finale, finding that nearly a third of users returned each week to tweet. Semi-structured interviews with 11 diverse live-tweeters revealed that the decision to live-tweet is dependent upon a variety of personal considerations and social conventions forming around this emerging TV viewing practice. This includes the desire to feel connected to a larger community that is interested in the show. Participants actively sought to protect the user experience of others by following good live-tweeting ""etiquette"", including limiting their number of posts and censoring content that might spoil the show for others.

"""My religious aunt asked why i was trying to sell her viagra"": experiences with account hijacking","With so much of our lives digital, online, and not entirely under our control, we risk losing access to our communications, reputation, and data. Recent years have brought a rash of high-profile account compromises, but account hijacking is not limited to high-profile accounts. In this paper, we report results of a survey about people's experiences with and attitudes toward account hijacking. The problem is widespread; 30% of our 294 participants had an email or social networking account accessed by an unauthorized party. Five themes emerged from our results: (1) compromised accounts are often valuable to victims, (2) attackers are mostly unknown, but sometimes known, to victims, (3) users acknowledge some responsibility for keeping their accounts secure, (4) users' understanding of important security measures is incomplete, and (5) harm from account hijacking is concrete and emotional. We discuss implications for designing security mechanisms to improve chances for user adoption.","Account hijacking is a widespread problem, with 30% of survey participants reporting unauthorized access to their email or social media accounts.

Estimating the social costs of friendsourcing,"Every day users of social networking services ask their followers and friends millions of questions. These friendsourced questions not only provide informational benefits, but also may reinforce social bonds. However, there is a limit to how much a person may want to friendsource. They may be uncomfortable asking questions that are too private, might not want to expend others' time or effort, or may feel as though they have already accrued too many social debts. These perceived social costs limit the potential benefits of friendsourcing. In this paper we explore the perceived social costs of friendsourcing on Twitter via a monetary choice. We develop a model of how users value the attention and effort of their social network while friendsourcing, compare and contrast it with paid question answering in a crowdsourced labor market, and provide future design considerations for better supporting friendsourcing.","Social Media can make people feel uncomfortable or hesitant to ask questions or seek help from their online networks due to concerns about imposing on others or accumulating too many ""social debts.""",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557181,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Is anyone out there?: unpacking Q&A hashtags on twitter,"In addition to posting news and status updates, many Twitter users post questions that seek various types of subjective and objective information. These questions are often labeled with 'Q&A' hashtags, such as #lazyweb or #twoogle. We surveyed Twitter users and found they employ these Q&A hashtags both as a topical signifier (this tweet needs an answer!) and to reach out to those beyond their immediate followers (a community of helpful tweeters who monitor the hashtag). However, our log analysis of thousands of hashtagged Q&A exchanges reveals that nearly all replies to hashtagged questions come from a user's immediate follower network, contradicting users' beliefs that they are tapping into a larger community by tagging their question tweets. This finding has implications for designing next-generation social search systems that reach and engage a wide audience of answerers.","Social Media users are misled into believing they are reaching a wider audience when using hashtags, when in reality, their posts are only being seen by their immediate followers.

Motivating people with chronic pain to do physical activity: opportunities for technology design,"Physical activity is important for improving quality of life in people with chronic pain. However, actual or anticipated pain exacerbation, and lack of confidence when doing physical activity, make it difficult to maintain and build towards long-term activity goals. Research guiding the design of interactive technology to motivate and support physical activity in people with chronic pain is lacking. We conducted studies with: (1) people with chronic pain, to understand how they maintained and increased physical activity in daily life and what factors deterred them; and (2) pain-specialist physiotherapists, to understand how they supported people with chronic pain. Building on this understanding, we investigated the use of auditory feedback to address some of the psychological barriers and needs identified and to increase self-efficacy, motivation and confidence in physical activity. We conclude by discussing further design opportunities based on the overall findings.","

StepStream: a school-based pervasive social fitness system for everyday adolescent health,"Computer-supported fitness interventions for adolescents have the potential to improve adolescents' attitudes and perceptions about physical activity through peer influence and interpersonal accountability. Past research has explored the potential of interventions based on competition and social-comparison mechanisms. We present a new approach: school-based, pervasive social fitness systems. We describe one such system: StepStream, a pedometer-based microblog we designed and deployed for four weeks with 42 US middle school students. StepStream users improved their attitudes about fitness and increased their sense of social support for fitness. The least-active students also increased their daily activity. We show that our school-based social fitness approach performed comparably in attitude and behavior change to more competitive or direct-comparison systems. These results expand the strategies available computer-supported fitness interventions.

Prospective motor control on tabletops: planning grasp for multitouch interaction,"Substantial amount of research in Psychology has studied how people manipulate objects in the physical world. This work has unveiled that people show strong signs of prospective motor planning, i.e., they choose initial grasps that avoid uncomfortable end postures and facilitate object manipulation. Interactive tabletops allow their users great flexibility in the manipulation of virtual objects but to our knowledge previous work has never examined whether prospective motor control takes place in this context. To test this, we ran three experiments. We systematically studied how users adapt their grasp when asked to translate and rotate virtual objects on a multitouch tabletop. Our results demonstrate that target position and orientation significantly affect the orientation of finger placement on the object. We analyze our results in the light of the most recent model of planning for manipulating physical objects and identify their implications for the design of tabletop interfaces. \","

Quantitative measurement of virtual vs. physical object embodiment through kinesthetic figural after effects,"Over the past decade, multi-touch surfaces have become commonplace, with many researchers and practitioners describing the benefits of their natural, physical-like interactions. We present a pair of studies that empirically investigates the psychophysical effects of direct interaction with both physical and virtual artefacts. We use the phenomenon of Kinesthetic Figural After Effects-a change in understanding of the physical size of an object after a period of exposure to an object of different size. Our studies show that, while this effect is robustly reproducible when using physical artefacts, this same effect does not manifest when manipulating virtual artefacts on a direct, multi-touch tabletop display. We contribute quantitative evidence suggesting a psychophysical difference in our response to physical vs. virtual objects, and discuss future research directions to explore measurable phenomena to evaluate the presence of physical-like changes from virtual on-screen objects.","

TouchTools: leveraging familiarity and skill with physical tools to augment touch interaction,"The average person can skillfully manipulate a plethora of tools, from hammers to tweezers. However, despite this remarkable dexterity, gestures on today's touch devices are simplistic, relying primarily on the chording of fingers: one-finger pan, two-finger pinch, four-finger swipe and similar. We propose that touch gesture design be inspired by the manipulation of physical tools from the real world. In this way, we can leverage user familiarity and fluency with such tools to build a rich set of gestures for touch interaction. With only a few minutes of training on a proof-of-concept system, users were able to summon a variety of virtual tools by replicating their corresponding real-world grasps.","Oversimplification of complex tasks.

The article suggests that current touchscreen devices rely too heavily on simple finger gestures, which can oversimplify complex tasks and limit the richness of touch interaction.

Current and future mobile and wearable device use by people with visual impairments,"With the increasing popularity of mainstream wearable devices, it is critical to assess the accessibility implications of such technologies. For people with visual impairments, who do not always need the visual display of a mobile phone, alternative means of eyes-free wearable interaction are particularly appealing. To explore the potential impacts of such technology, we conducted two studies. The first was an online survey that included 114 participants with visual impairments and 101 sighted participants; we compare the two groups in terms of current device use. The second was an interview and design probe study with 10 participants with visual impairments. Our findings expand on past work to characterize a range of trends in smartphone use and accessibility issues therein. Participants with visual impairments also responded positively to two eyes-free wearable device scenarios: a wristband or ring and a glasses-based device. Discussions on projected use of these devices suggest that small, easily accessible, and discreet wearable input could positively impact the ability of people with visual impairments to access information on the go and to participate in certain social interactions.","

Visually impaired users on an online social network,"In this paper we present the first large-scale empirical study of how visually impaired people use online social networks, specifically Facebook. We identify a sample of 50K visually impaired users, and study the activities they perform, the content they produce, and the friendship networks they build on Facebook. We find that visually impaired users participate on Facebook (e.g. status updates, comments, likes) as much as the general population, and receive more feedback (i.e., comments and likes) on average on their content. By analyzing the content produced by visually impaired users, we find that they share their experience and issues related to vision impairment. We also identify distinctive patterns in their language and technology use. We also show that, compared to other users, visually impaired users have smaller social networks, but such differences have decreased over time.

The personal cockpit: a spatial interface for effective task switching on head-worn displays,"As wearable computing goes mainstream, we must improve the state of interface design to keep users productive with natural-feeling interactions. We present the Personal Cockpit, a solution for mobile multitasking on head-worn displays. We appropriate empty space around the user to situate virtual windows for use with direct input. Through a design-space exploration, we run a series of user studies to fine-tune our layout of the Personal Cockpit.

Exploring the use of hand-to-face input for interacting with head-worn displays,"We propose the use of Hand-to-Face input, a method to interact with head-worn displays (HWDs) that involves contact with the face. We explore Hand-to-Face interaction to find suitable techniques for common mobile tasks. We evaluate this form of interaction with document navigation tasks and examine its social acceptability. In a first study, users identify the cheek and forehead as predominant areas for interaction and agree on gestures for tasks involving continuous input, such as document navigation. These results guide the design of several Hand-to-Face navigation techniques and reveal that gestures performed on the cheek are more efficient and less tiring than interactions directly on the HWD. Initial results on the social acceptability of Hand-to-Face input allow us to further refine our design choices, and reveal unforeseen results: some gestures are considered culturally inappropriate and gender plays a role in selection of specific Hand-to-Face interactions. From our overall results, we provide a set of guidelines for developing effective Hand-to-Face interaction techniques.","

"In-your-face, yet unseen?: improving head-stabilized warnings to reduce reaction time","One unique property of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is that content can easily be displayed at a fixed position within the user's field of view (head-stabilized). This ensures that critical information (e.g. warnings) is continuously visible and can, in principle, be perceived as quickly as possible. We examined this strategy with a physically and visually distracted driver. We ran two consecutive studies in a driving simulator, comparing different warning visualizations in a head-up display (HUD) and a HMD. In an initial study, we found no significant effects of warning type or display technology on the reaction times. In a second study, after modifying our visualization to include a visual reference marker, we found that with only this minor change, reaction times were significantly lower in the HMD when compared to the HUD. Our insights can help others design better head-stabilized notifications.","Distraction caused by head-mounted displays (HMDs) while driving, leading to slower reaction times and potentially increasing the risk of accidents.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557063,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Kinect-taped communication: using motion sensing to study gesture use and similarity in face-to-face and computer-mediated brainstorming,"One key difference between face-to-face (F2F) communication and computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the availability of visual cues.

Curated city: capturing individual city guides through social curation,"We report on our design of Curated City, a website that lets people build their own personal guide to the city's neighborhoods by chronicling their favorite experiences. Although users make their own personal guides, they are immersed in a social curatorial experience where they are influenced directly and indirectly by the guides of others. We use a 2-week field trial involving 20 residents of Pittsburgh as a technological probe to explore the initial design decisions, and we further refine the design landscape through subject interviews. Based on this study, we identify a set of design recommendations for building scalable social platforms for curating the experiences of the city.","

Social media platforms like Curated City can create a false sense of connection and community among users, leading to a lack of meaningful, in-person interactions and a decreased sense of responsibility for one's own experiences and opinions.

Studying digital graffiti as a location-based social network,"Increasing amounts of geo-tagged social media have led to interest in how that media can be re-integrated into the physical environment. Yet, although location information is often automatically appended to media, little is know about how users consider location in its creation and viewing. Using Graffiti as a design meme, we developed a novel social media service to investigate these issues. A two week field study showed how users incorporated both utilitarian and playful aspects of location into their social media creation, as well as revealing a disconnect between the location-media relationship intended by creators and perceived by viewers. We outline implications of our work for services that seek to repurpose existing geo-tagged social media in the design of novel services.","Users may not be aware of the potential consequences of geo-tagging their social media posts, which can lead to a disconnect between the location-media relationship intended by creators and perceived by viewers.

Social epistemic cognition in online interactions,"Social media and online social networks dramatically change the way in which knowledge is acquired and disseminated. How do we re-understand about human knowledge and knowing? This work aims at extending the current understanding of human epistemic cognition in online social environments, where epistemic cognition refers to cognitions and cognitive processes related to epistemic matters such as knowledge and beliefs justification. We approach our inquiry with mixed methods: (1) quantitative study to test whether epistemic cognition might differ in individual and social contexts, and whether online interactions might mediate the later; and (2) social cognitive task analysis with interviews to manifest the intricate interplay of dynamics between social epistemic cognition and online interactions. We introduce the new construct of social epistemic cognition and contribute to the field of HCI with an evolved theory which states that epistemic cognition can be promoted in online social environments as mediated by online interactions.","Social media can negatively impact the way we acquire and share knowledge, potentially leading to a decrease in critical thinking and epistemic cognition.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2556977,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Spending real money: purchasing patterns of virtual goods in an online social game,"Researchers have found that 'social' factors contribute to purchasing intentions of virtual goods in an online social game, but little is known about actual purchasing behavior. Study 1 examined the relationship between social factors and virtual goods purchasing patterns using large scale data obtained by server logs of an online social game. Exchange of virtual goods and number of friends increased the likelihood of spending real money compared to no spending. Among those who did spend real money, giving virtual goods to others was the strongest factor associated with the amount of spending. Study 2 examined purchasing patterns of players who spent real money: high real-money spenders were buying items for visual customization while low spenders were buying consumable items necessary to sustain playing the game.","Social Media can manipulate people into spending money.

"Combining body pose, gaze, and gesture to determine intention to interact in vision-based interfaces","Vision-based interfaces, such as those made popular by the Microsoft Kinect, suffer from the Midas Touch problem: every user motion can be interpreted as an interaction. In response, we developed an algorithm that combines facial features, body pose and motion to approximate a user's intention to interact with the system. We show how this can be used to determine when to pay attention to a user's actions and when to ignore them. To demonstrate the value of our approach, we present results from a 30-person lab study conducted to compare four engagement algorithms in single and multi-user scenarios. We found that combining intention to interact with a 'raise an open hand in front of you' gesture yielded the best results. The latter approach offers a 12% improvement in accuracy and a 20% reduction in time to engage over a baseline 'wave to engage' gesture currently used on the Xbox 360.","

[D74] Haptic turk: A motion platform based on people,"Motion platforms are used to increase the realism of virtual interaction. Unfortunately, their size and weight is proportional to what they actuate. We present haptic turk, a different approach to motion platforms that is light and mobile. The key idea is to replace motors and mechanical components with humans. All haptic turk setups consist of a player who is supported by one or more “turkers”. The player enjoys an interactive expe-rience, such as a flight simulation. The motion in the player's experience is generated by the turkers who manually lift, tilt, and push the player's limbs or torso. To get the timing and force right, timed motion instructions in a format familiar from rhythm games are dis-played on turkers' mobile devices, which they attach to the player's body. We also present an immersive set-up based on a head-mounted display.","

The use of humans as ""turkers"" to generate motion in virtual reality experiences raises concerns about the exploitation of workers, as they are required to physically exert themselves to create the sensation of movement for the player. This could lead to physical strain and potentially dangerous working conditions for the turkers, who may not be fairly compensated for their labor.

MisTable: reach-through personal screens for tabletops,"We present MisTable, a tabletop system that combines a conventional horizontal interactive surface with personal screens between the user and the tabletop surface. These personal screens, built using fog, are both see-through and reach-through. Being see-through provides direct line of sight of the personal screen and the elements behind it on the tabletop. Being reach-through allows the user to switch from interacting with the personal screen to reaching through it to interact with the tabletop or the space above it. The personal screen allows a range of customisations and novel interactions such as presenting 2D personal contents on the screen, 3D contents above the tabletop or augmenting and relighting tangible objects differently for each user. Besides, having a personal screen for each user allows us to customize the view of each of them according to their identity or preferences. Finally, the personal screens preserve all well-established tabletop interaction techniques like touch and tangible interactions. We explore the challenges in building such a reach-through system through a proof-of-concept implementation and discuss the possibilities afforded by the system.","

The use of personal screens in MisTable may lead to a decrease in face-to-face interaction and social skills, as users focus more on their individual screens rather than interacting with others around the table. This could result in a loss of nonverbal communication and social cues, potentially leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications. Additionally, the customization of views based on identity or preferences may create a sense of isolation, where users are less aware of the common shared space and may not feel the need to compromise or collaborate with others.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557325,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

Experimental evaluation of user interfaces for visual indoor navigation,"Mobile location recognition by capturing images of the environment (visual localization) is a promising technique for indoor navigation in arbitrary surroundings. However, it has barely been investigated so far how the user interface (UI) can cope with the challenges of the vision-based localization technique, such as varying quality of the query images. We implemented a novel UI for visual localization, consisting of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) views that actively communicate and ensure localization accuracy. If necessary, the system encourages the user to point the smartphone at distinctive regions to improve localization quality. We evaluated the UI in a experimental navigation task with a prototype, informed by initial evaluation results using design mockups. We found that VR can contribute to efficient and effective indoor navigation even at unreliable location and orientation accuracy.

Partially intelligent automobiles and driving experience at the moment of system transition,"The current study (N = 49) took a user-centered approach to explore how level of automation (pedal automated, wheel automated or fully automated driving) and the interface modality (switching automation on or off via touch or voice control) in automated vehicles influence drivers' perceived experience and performance. The results found that full or wheel automation in vehicles was perceived significantly more intelligent than pedal automation. Furthermore, drivers in the pedal automation condition reported greater nervousness when using the touch interface than the voice interface. This tendency was not found among drivers in the full and wheel automation conditions. Drivers who used the voice interface to control automated driving had fewer driving mistakes than those who operated the touch interface. Our findings have important psychological and practical implications for designing a user interface for automated vehicles.","Drivers may become too reliant on voice assistants and neglect their own driving skills, leading to decreased performance and increased mistakes.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557370,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
AudioCanvas: internet-free interactive audio photos,"In this paper we present a novel interaction technique that helps to make textual information more accessible to those with low or no textual literacy skills. AudioCanvas allows cameraphone users to interact directly with their own photos of printed media to receive audio feedback or narration. The use of a remote telephone-based service also allows our design to be used over a standard phone line, removing the need for data connections, which can be problematic in developing regions. We show the value of the technique via user evaluations in both a rural Indian village and a South African township.","

MixFab: a mixed-reality environment for personal fabrication,"Personal fabrication machines, such as 3D printers and laser cutters, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. However, designing objects for fabrication still requires 3D modeling skills, thereby rendering such technologies inaccessible to a wide user-group. In this paper, we introduce MixFab, a mixed-reality environment for personal fabrication that lowers the barrier for users to engage in personal fabrication. Users design objects in an immersive augmented reality environment, interact with virtual objects in a direct gestural manner and can introduce existing physical objects effortlessly into their designs. We describe the design and implementation of MixFab, a user-defined gesture study that informed this design, show artifacts designed with the system and describe a user study evaluating the system's prototype.","

The increased accessibility of personal fabrication machines through mixed-reality environments like MixFab may lead to a proliferation of user-generated content that reinforces harmful societal norms and biases, as users may create objects that reflect and perpetuate existing inequalities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557090,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Understanding digital and material social communications for older adults,"Online technologies are promising for helping older adults maintain social connectedness, particularly with younger people, yet many older adults resist or participate minimally in the mainstream technologies used by younger members of their social network. We present results from an interview study involving 22 older adults (age 71-92) to understand communication preferences and values related to social media. Seniors articulate many concerns with online social media, including the time required for legitimate participation, the loss of deeper communication, content irrelevance, and privacy. Additionally, older adults engage in social practices that could be supported by online social technologies, but they rarely use such tools. The theme of material social communications emerges from our data, and we examine this in context of online social media. We conclude with design considerations for the development of social media for older adults, and as part of this we describe the notion of bridging technologies as a framework for intergenerational communication design.","Older adults are resistant to using social media due to concerns about time commitment, loss of meaningful communication, irrelevant content, and privacy issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557133,Social Media,CHI,user experience
What's on your mind?: investigating recommendations for inclusive social networking and older adults,"Social networking sites (SNSs) are becoming increasingly popular as a method for social interaction. While research has reported benefits associated with components of SNS usage, a digital divide has emerged between younger and older users. SNSs can be useful for communicating with family members and helping one feel digitally included; however, there are a wide range of reasons why many older adults choose not to use this kind of technology. We present a series of user studies investigating the barriers and challenges that SNSs can present to older users. These user studies led to the derivation of user recommendations to mitigate these barriers. The recommendations were then evaluated within a comparative evaluation which involved 25 older adults completing tasks on two interface versions of a simulation SNS. We present the recommendations and the methods of their creation and evaluation. Implications for developers of SNSs are discussed.","Digital divide between younger and older users.

"The lonely raccoon at the ball: designing for intimacy, sociability, and selfhood","Designing for sociable systems requires, among other abilities, a sensitivity to the meanings, structures, and nuances of technology-mediated experiences that are simultaneously felt by users to be intimate and also social. Such a sensitivity is not easily acquired, and design researchers have recommended the use of social theories to guide designers' readings of technology-mediated social experiences. We use philosopher Michel Foucault's theory of identity (and social power, discourse, sexuality, creativity, and style) known as ""the care of the self,"" as a scaffold with which to produce a sensitive interpretation of the intimacy (and expert social creative) practices of adult users of the virtual world Second Life (SL). This reading sheds light on several skilled and creative intimacy practices in SL. It also offers a philosophically grounded hermeneutic strategy for designers interested in analyzing intimate experiences.","

The article highlights the potential for virtual reality technology to blur the lines between intimacy and social interaction, leading to a loss of privacy and potentially harmful power dynamics.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557127,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,power dynamics
Recreating living experiences from past memories through virtual worlds for people with dementia,"This paper describes a study aimed to understand the use of 3D virtual world (VW) technology to support life engagement for people with dementia in long-term care. Three versions of VW prototypes (reminiscence room, virtual tour and gardening) utilising gestured-base interaction were developed iteratively. These prototypes were tested with older residents (80+) with dementia in care homes and their caregivers. Data collection was based on observations of how the residents and care staff interacted collaboratively with the VW. We discussed in depth the use of VWs in stimulating past memories and how this technology could help enhance their sense of self through various means. We also highlighted key approaches in designing VWs to sustain attention, create ludic experiences and facilitate interaction for older people with dementia.","

The use of 3D virtual world technology to support life engagement for people with dementia in long-term care may lead to a decrease in their sense of self and personal identity, as they become increasingly reliant on technology to stimulate their memories and experiences. This could result in a loss of autonomy and independence, and may also impact their ability to form meaningful connections with others. Additionally, the use of gestured-based interaction may be challenging for some residents, leading to frustration and feelings of isolation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557035,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Sweet Home: understanding diabetes management via a chinese online community,"China has overtaken India and the U.S. as host to the largest diabetic population in the world. Many problems exist in the Chinese healthcare system and very small number of diabetes patients receives treatment. Our paper reports on a case study through the lens of an online diabetes patient community, Sweet Home. We conducted participant observations, text analysis, and interviews, to understand the health management of patients at Sweet Home. Our findings reveal that patients' understanding of diabetes, their choice of treatments, their routine management, and their interactions with others (in the physical world) and among themselves (in the online world) are influenced by many factors: belief in traditional Chinese versus western medicine, cultural and social norms regarding social eating and drinking, conflicts over self-images, and responses to comments and pressures of coworkers. That is, social context may significantly affect patients' behaviors and each individual patient's actions may also help reshape the social context. We draw out implications for how our society as a whole may respond to these issues, from the perspective of public health, education, and information technology design.","Social media can influence patients' understanding and management of diabetes, and their interactions with others, in ways that may not be beneficial for their health, due to factors such as cultural and social norms, conflicts over self-images, and responses to comments and pressures of coworkers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557344,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Multi-viewer gesture-based interaction for omni-directional video,"Omni-directional video (ODV) is a novel medium that offers viewers a 360º panoramic recording. This type of content will become more common within our living rooms in the near future, seeing that immersive displaying technologies such as 3D television are on the rise. However, little attention has been given to how to interact with ODV content. We present a gesture elicitation study in which we asked users to perform mid-air gestures that they consider to be appropriate for ODV interaction, both for individual as well as collocated settings. We are interested in the gesture variations and adaptations that come forth from individual and collocated usage. To this end, we gathered quantitative and qualitative data by means of observations, motion capture, questionnaires and interviews. This data resulted in a user-defined gesture set for ODV, alongside an in-depth analysis of the variation in gestures we observed during the study.","

The study found that users had difficulty interacting with Omni-directional video (ODV) content, resulting in a lack of intuitive and effective gestures for interacting with the technology. This could lead to user frustration and a negative experience with ODV, potentially hindering its adoption and use in the future.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557113,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Pervasive information through constant personal projection: the ambient mobile pervasive display (AMP-D),"The vision of pervasive ambient information displays which show relevant information has not yet come true. One of the main reasons is the limited number of available displays in the environment which is a fundamental requirement of the original vision. We introduce the concept of an Ambient Mobile Pervasive Display AMP-D which is a wearable projector system that constantly projects an ambient information display in front of the user. The floor display provides serendipitous access to public and personal information. The display is combined with a projected display on the user's hand, forming a continuous interaction space that is controlled by hand gestures. The paper introduces this novel device concept, discusses its interaction design, and explores its advantages through various implemented application examples. Furthermore, we present the AMP-D prototype which illustrates the involved challenges concerning hardware, sensing, and visualization.","

The constant projection of information in front of the user can lead to sensory overload and distraction, potentially causing accidents or decreased productivity. The user may also feel overwhelmed by the constant stream of information, leading to anxiety or stress. Additionally, the use of hand gestures to control the display may be seen as intrusive or disruptive, especially in social situations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557365,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Bigger is not always better: display size, performance, and task load during peephole map navigation","Dynamic peephole navigation is an increasingly popular technique for navigating large information spaces such as maps. Users can view the map through handheld, spatially aware displays that serve as peepholes and navigate the map by moving these displays in physical space. We conducted a controlled experiment of peephole map navigation with 16 participants to better understand the effect of a peephole's size on users' map navigation behavior, navigation performance, and task load. Simulating different peephole sizes from 4' (smartphone) up to 120' (control condition), we confirmed that larger peepholes significantly improve learning speed, navigation speed, and reduce task load; however, this added benefit diminishes with growing sizes. Our data shows that a relatively small, tablet-sized peephole can serve as a 'sweet spot' between peephole size and both user navigation performance and user task load.","Over-reliance on technology can lead to decreased spatial awareness and navigation skills. As people rely more on technology to navigate, they may become less proficient in navigating physical spaces independently, potentially leading to difficulties in situations where technology is unavailable.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557071,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Stewarding a legacy: responsibilities and relationships in the management of post-mortem data,"This paper extends research on the giving and inheriting of digital artifacts by examining social network site accounts post-mortem. Given the important role that social network sites play in online bereavement practices, we conducted a series of in-depth qualitative interviews to explore issues around inheritance and post-mortem data management of Facebook accounts. We found that participants focused less on ownership of the data, and instead on the duties and potential conflicts associated with maintaining an account post-mortem. Subsequently, we argue for 'stewardship' as an alternative to inheritance for framing post-mortem data management practices. Analysis of post-mortem data management activities highlights how stewards are accountable and responsible to the deceased and various survivors. However, weighing competing responsibilities is complicated by varied relationships with disparate survivors, as well as the inability to consult with the deceased. Based on our findings, we claim that post-mortem solutions need to account for the needs of stewards in addition to those of the deceased and survivors. We suggest that a model of stewardship better accounts for the interpersonal responsibilities that accompany online data than inheritance alone.","

Social Media platforms like Facebook create a new kind of digital inheritance problem when someone dies. The people left behind must figure out how to manage the digital artifacts and data associated with the deceased's online presence, which can be a difficult and emotionally fraught process. Different people may have different ideas about how to handle the data, and there is no clear-cut solution for resolving these conflicts. This can lead to feelings of confusion, guilt, and anxiety for those tasked with managing the digital remains.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557059,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Captioned photographs in psychosocial aged care: relationship building and boundary work,"In this paper we examine the use of a novel social technology to support the provision of formal aged care services to clients who live in their own homes. Social technologies offer enormous potential for enhancing aged care, but research on their use in aged care has largely focused on institutional or informal care settings, rather than formal care in the home. Meanwhile, technologies for aging in place typically focus on monitoring and security, rather than psychosocial support. We conducted a field study in which aged care managers used a photo and message-sharing tool to communicate with clients living in their own homes. Our findings demonstrate that visual and social forms of communication are valuable for supporting psychosocial care-giving, but there are barriers to effectively adopting new communication tools in this setting. Time constraints inhibited care managers' use of the technology, which was also influenced by their efforts to carefully maintain boundaries between their personal and professional lives.","

Growing closer on facebook: changes in tie strength through social network site use,"Scientists debate whether people grow closer to their friends through social networking sites like Facebook, whether those sites displace more meaningful interaction, or whether they simply reflect existing ties. Combining server log analysis and longitudinal surveys of 3,649 Facebook users reporting on relationships with 26,134 friends, we find that communication on the site is associated with changes in reported relationship closeness, over and above effects attributable to their face-to-face, phone, and email contact. Tie strength increases with both one-on-one communication, such as posts, comments, and messages, and through reading friends' broadcasted content, such as status updates and photos. The effect is greater for composed pieces, such as comments, posts, and messages than for 'one-click' actions such as 'likes.' Facebook has a greater impact on non-family relationships and ties who do not frequently communicate via other channels.","Social Media can make people feel closer to their friends, but it actually displaces more meaningful interactions and relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557094,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
"The many faces of facebook: experiencing social media as performance, exhibition, and personal archive","The growing use of social media means that an increasing amount of people's lives are visible online. We draw from Goffman's theatrical metaphor and Hogan's exhibition approach to explore how people manage their personal collection of social media data over time. We conducted a qualitative study of 13 participants to reveal their day-to-day decision-making about producing and curating digital traces on Facebook. Their goals and strategies showed that people experience the Facebook platform as consisting of three different functional regions: a performance region for managing recent data and impression management, an exhibition region for longer term presentation of self-image, and a personal region for archiving meaningful facets of life. Further, users' need for presenting and archiving data in these three regions is mediated by temporality. These findings trigger a discussion of how to design social media that support these dynamic and sometimes conflicting needs.","People's lives are becoming increasingly visible online, leading to a need for constant self-presentation and curation of personal data on social media platforms. This can result in a performance of identity rather than authentic expression, and a pressure to maintain a certain image that can be detrimental to mental health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470656,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Favors from facebook friends: unpacking dimensions of social capital,"Past research has demonstrated a link between perceptions of social capital and use of the popular social network site, Facebook. Williams' Internet Social Capital Scales, based on Putnam's formulation, tap into sub-dimensions of social capital that have not been broadly used yet may enlighten our understanding of the different ways in which connecting with others online can facilitate access to resources embedded within our social relationships. In this study, we segment Williams' Internet Social Capital Scales into various sub-dimensions using factor analysis and explicate the distinct facets of social capital through a lab experiment in which Facebook users (N=98) request a small favor from their Facebook network. We find that some sub-dimensions play a significant role in getting favors from Facebook friends while bonding and bridging social capital do not significantly predict responses to favor requests.","Social Media can make people less likely to help others in need.

The study found that people who use social media, like Facebook, may have a harder time getting help from their online friends when they need it. This is because some aspects of social capital, like bonding and bridging, don't seem to help people get favors from their online friends. This means that people may feel less connected and supported by their online communities, and may be less likely to help others in need.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470657,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Quantifying the invisible audience in social networks,"When you share content in an online social network, who is listening? Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content, making their audience seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design, since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online. In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27% of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals --- friend count, likes, and comments --- vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61% of their friends each month. Together, our results begin to reveal the invisible undercurrents of audience attention and behavior in online social networks.","Social media users consistently underestimate their audience size, which can lead to inaccurate self-presentation and content production. Users have limited information about their audience, making it difficult to estimate who is listening, and publicly visible signals do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470658,Social Media,CHI,user experience

Generally, women receive more feedback than men, but ""male"" topics (those more often posted by men) receive more feedback, especially when posted by women.","Social media platforms like Facebook can reinforce gender stereotypes and unequal engagement patterns, where men dominate discussions on public topics and women receive more feedback for personal topics, perpetuating gendered social norms.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470659,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Using contextual integrity to examine interpersonal information boundary on social network sites,"Although privacy problems in Social Network Sites (SNS) have become more salient than ever in recent years, interpersonal privacy issues in SNS remain understudied. This study aims to generate insights in understanding users' interpersonal privacy concerns by expounding interpersonal privacy boundaries in SNS.

Older adults as digital content producers,"Older adults are normally characterized as consumers, rather than producers, of digital content. Current research concerning the design of technologies for older adults typically focuses on providing access to digital resources. Access is important, but is often insufficient, especially when establishing new social relationships. This paper investigates the nature and role of digital content that has been created by older adults, for the purpose of forging new relationships. We present a unique field study in which seven older adults (aged 71-92 years), who did not know each other, used a prototype iPad application (Enmesh) to create and share photographs and messages. The findings demonstrate that older adults, even those in the \'1c""oldest old\'1d"" age group, embraced opportunities to express themselves creatively through digital content production. We show that self-expression and social engagement with peers can be realized when socio-technical systems are suitably designed to allow older adults to create and share their own digital content.","Older adults are often excluded from creating digital content and are instead relegated to being consumers, which can limit their ability to express themselves creatively and form new relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470662,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice

Augmented endurance: controlling fatigue while handling objects by affecting weight perception using augmented reality,"The main contribution of this paper is to develop a method for alleviating fatigue during handling medium-weight objects and augmenting our endurance by affecting our weight perception with augmented reality technology. To assist people to lift medium-weight objects without a complex structure or various costs, we focus on the phenomenon that our weight perception during handling objects is affected by visual properties. Our hypothesis is that this illusionary effect in weight perception can be applied to reduce fatigue while handling medium-weight objects without mechatronics-based physical assistance. In this paper, we propose an augmented reality system that changes the brightness value of an object in order to reduce fatigue while handling the object. We conducted two fundamental experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Our results suggested that the system eliminates the need to use excess energy for handling objects and reduces fatigue during the handling task.","Reduced muscle strength and endurance due to over-reliance on technology, potentially leading to decreased physical fitness and increased risk of injury.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470665,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Unlimited editions: three approaches to the dissemination and display of digital art,"The paper reflects on three approaches to the dissemination and display of digital art. \'1c""s[edition]\'1d"" is a novel, web-based service that offers limited editions of ""\'1cdigital prints""\'1d. Analysis of user comments suggests that the metaphor of a \'1c""limited digital edition""\'1d raises issues and to some extent is resisted. The second approach is the Flickr Brushes Gallery, where digital painters post images and comment on one another's work. Analysis of comment boards indicates that the shared art and comments are a form of gift exchange. Finally, the paper discusses a field study in which artists exhibited their work as it develops over time in digital frames and also in an immersive digital projection room. Analysis of field notes and interviews indicate that the digital frame approach was unsuccessful because of aesthetic and environmental concerns. The immersive projection suggested that more experiential approaches may be more interesting. It is argued that there is an inherent resistance in digital media to previous models of art commoditization. None of the approaches discussed here resolve the dilemma but rather indicate the scope and complexity of the issues.",Resistance to previous models of art commoditization in digital media.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470674,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Pointing at 3d target projections with one-eyed and stereo cursors,"We present a study of cursors for selecting 2D-projected 3D targets. We compared a stereo- and mono-rendered (one-eyed) cursor using two mouse-based and two remote pointing techniques in a 3D Fitts' law pointing experiment. The first experiment used targets at fixed depths. Results indicate that one-eyed cursors only improve screen-plane pointing techniques, and that constant target depth does not influence pointing throughput. A second experiment included pointing between targets at varying depths and used only ""screen-plane"" pointing techniques. Our results suggest that in the absence of stereo cue conflicts, screen-space projections of Fitts' law parameters (target size and distance) yield constant throughput despite target depth differences and produce better models of performance.","

The study found that using a one-eyed cursor in a 3D environment can actually make it more difficult to accurately select targets, especially when the targets are at varying depths. This is because the one-eyed cursor does not provide the same level of depth perception as a stereo-rendered cursor, leading to confusion and errors in target selection.

A preliminary investigation of human adaptations for various virtual eyes in video see-through HMDS,"A video see-through head mounted display (HMD) has a different viewing point than does the real eye, resulting in visual displacement (VD). VD deteriorates visuomotor performance due to sensory conflict. Previous work has investigated this deterioration and human adaptation by comparing fixed VD and real eye conditions. In this study we go a step further to investigate whether any differences in visuomotor and adaptation trends exist across 16 distinct VD conditions. The performance tasks studied were of two types: foot placement and finger touch. In contrast to our initial prediction, the results showed equal task performance levels and adaptation within about 5 minutes regardless of VD conditions. We found that human adaptation covered a variety of VDs --- up to 55 mm in the X, Y direction; up to 125mm in the Z direction; and up to 140mm of interocular distance (IOD).

Access lens: a gesture-based screen reader for real-world documents,"Gesture-based touch screen user interfaces, when designed to be accessible to blind users, can be an effective mode of interaction for those users. However, current accessible touch screen interaction techniques suffer from one serious limitation: they are only usable on devices that have been explicitly designed to support them. Access Lens is a new interaction method that uses computer vision-based gesture tracking to enable blind people to use accessible gestures on paper documents and other physical objects, such as product packages, device screens, and home appliances. This paper describes the development of Access Lens hardware and software, the iterative design of Access Lens in collaboration with blind computer users, and opportunities for future development.","

The development of Access Lens technology, which uses computer vision-based gesture tracking to enable blind people to use accessible gestures on paper documents and other physical objects, may lead to a decrease in the use of braille and other tactile methods of communication, potentially causing a loss of tactile literacy and independence for blind individuals.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470704,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Exploring personality-targeted UI design in online social participation systems,"We present a theoretical foundation and empirical findings demonstrating the effectiveness of personality-targeted design. Much like a medical treatment applied to a person based on his specific genetic profile, we argue that theory-driven, personality-targeted UI design can be more effective than design applied to the entire population. The empirical exploration focused on two settings, two populations and two personality traits: Study 1 shows that users' extraversion level moderates the relationship between the UI cue of audience size and users' contribution. Study 2 demonstrates that the effectiveness of social anchors in encouraging online contributions depends on users' level of emotional stability. Taken together, the findings demonstrate the potential and robustness of the interactionist approach to UI design. The findings contribute to the HCI community, and in particular to designers of social systems, by providing guidelines to targeted design that can increase online participation.","Social Media platforms can be designed to manipulate users' psychological vulnerabilities, such as extraversion and emotional stability, to encourage addictive and excessive use.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470707,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Regularly visited patches in human mobility,"In this paper, we propose a new analytic unit for human mobility analysis -- the patch. We developed a process to identify Regularly Visited Patches (RVP) and a set of metrics to characterize and measure their spatial patterns. Using a large dataset of Foursquare check-ins as a test bed, we show that RVP analysis reveals fundamental patterns of human mobility and will lead to promising research with strong implications for businesses.","

The use of Foursquare check-ins and other location-based services can lead to a loss of privacy, as users' movements and habits can be easily tracked and analyzed. This can have negative implications for individuals, such as targeted advertising and potential surveillance. Additionally, the analysis of mobility patterns can reinforce existing social and economic inequalities, as certain groups may be more likely to visit certain areas or businesses.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470711,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Probing bus stop for insights on transit co-design,"Social computing provides a new way for citizens to engage with their public service. Our research investigates how social computing might support citizens co-design their transit service. We conducted a field study with public transit riders, exploring the issues and controversies that reveal conflicting communities. Our analyses revealed three insights. First, encourage citizens to share what they see as the rationale for current service offerings. Second, encourage citizens to share the consequences of current services and of proposed changes and new designs. Third, focus on producing a shared citizen and service provider understanding of what the goals and mission of the public service should be.","Conflicting communities may arise from the use of social computing in public transit services, leading to disagreements and controversies among citizens and service providers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470714,Social Media,CHI,politics
SpatialEase: learning language through body motion,"Games that engage both mind and body by targeting users' kinesthetic intelligence have the potential to transform the activity of learning across a wide variety of domains. To investigate this potential in the context of second language learning, we have developed SpatialEase: a Kinect game for the body-based learning of language that is grounded in space and motion. In this game, learners respond to audio commands in the second language by moving their bodies in space, while a game mechanic based on distributed cued-recall supports learning over time. Our comparison of SpatialEase with the popular Rosetta Stone software for learner of Mandarin Chinese showed similar learning gains over a single session and generated several key implications for the future design of mixed-modality learning systems.","

Playing with leadership and expertise: military tropes and teamwork in an arg,"Ad-hoc virtual teams often lack tools to formalize leadership and structure collaboration, yet they are often successful. How does this happen? We argue that the emergence of leadership and the development of expertise occurs in the process of taking action and in direct response to a lack of structure. Using a twinned set of eight modality sliders, we examine the interactions of fourteen players in an alternate reality game. We find that players adopted military language and culture to structure and arrange their play. We determine that it is critical to account for the context of play across these modalities in order to design appropriately for effective in-game virtual organizing.",Lack of structure and leadership in virtual teams can lead to ineffective collaboration and poor decision-making.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470755,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,power dynamics
Tweeting for class: co-construction as a means for engaging students in lectures,"Motivating students to be active learners is a perennial problem in education, and is particularly challenging in lectures where instructors typically prepare content in ad-vance with little direct student participation. We describe our experience using Twitter as a tool for student ""co-construction"" of lecture materials. Students were required to post a tweet prior to each lecture related to that day's topic, and these tweets -- consisting of questions, examples and reflections -- were incorporated into the lecture slides and notes. Students reported that they found lectures including their tweets in the class slides to be engaging, interactive and relevant, and nearly 90% of them recommended we use our co-construction approach again.","Social Media can make students less engaged and interactive in real-life, face-to-face interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470767,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Delivering patients to sacré coeur: collective intelligence in digital volunteer communities,"This study examines the information-processing activities of digital volunteers and other connected ICT users in the wake of crisis events. Synthesizing findings from several previous research studies of digital volunteerism, this paper offers a new approach for conceptualizing the activities of digital volunteers, shifting from a focus on organizing to a focus on information movement. Using the lens of distributed cognition, this research describes collective intelligence as transformations of information within a system where cognition is distributed socially across individuals as well as through their tools and resources. This paper demonstrates how digital volunteers, through activities such as relaying, amplifying, verifying, and structuring information, function as a collectively intelligent cognitive system in the wake of disaster events.","

Does slacktivism hurt activism?: the effects of moral balancing and consistency in online activism,"In this paper we explore how the decision of partaking in low-cost, low-risk online activism - slacktivism - \'14may affect subsequent civic action. Based on moral balancing and consistency effects, we designed an online experiment to test if signing or not signing an online petition increased or decreased subsequent contribution to a charity. We found that participants who signed the online petition were significantly more likely to donate money to a related charity, demonstrating a consistency effect. We also found that participants who did not sign the petition donated significantly more money to an unrelated charity, demonstrating a moral balancing effect. The results suggest that exposure to an online activism influences individual decision on subsequent civic actions.","Social Media technology may encourage people to prioritize low-cost, low-risk online activism over more impactful, but also more costly and risky, offline activism.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470770,Social Media,CHI,politics
A longitudinal study of follow predictors on twitter,"Follower count is important to Twitter users: it can indicate popularity and prestige. Yet, holistically, little is understood about what factors -- like social behavior, message content, and network structure - lead to more followers. Such information could help technologists design and build tools that help users grow their audiences. In this paper, we study 507 Twitter users and a half-million of their tweets over 15 months. Marrying a longitudinal approach with a negative binomial auto-regression model, we find that variables for message content, social behavior, and network structure should be given equal consideration when predicting link formations on Twitter. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of follow predictors, and the first to show that the relative contributions of social behavior and mes-sage content are just as impactful as factors related to social network structure for predicting growth of online social networks. We conclude with practical and theoretical implications for designing social media technologies.","

The article highlights the importance of follower count on Twitter and the desire to grow one's audience. However, the study also reveals that the factors that contribute to growing one's followers, such as social behavior, message content, and network structure, are not always positive. For example, users may engage in negative or harmful behavior to gain more followers, or they may prioritize quantity over quality in their interactions. This can lead to a culture of superficiality and competition on social media, where users feel pressure to constantly perform and produce content, rather than engaging in meaningful and authentic interactions. Additionally, the emphasis on growing one's followers can lead to a focus on self-promotion and personal branding, rather than on sharing valuable and informative content. This can contribute to the erosion of trust and credibility in online discourse.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2470771,Social Media,CHI,user experience
IllumiRoom: peripheral projected illusions for interactive experiences,"IllumiRoom is a proof-of-concept system that augments the area surrounding a television with projected visualizations to enhance traditional gaming experiences. We investigate how projected visualizations in the periphery can negate, include, or augment the existing physical environment and complement the content displayed on the television screen. Peripheral projected illusions can change the appearance of the room, induce apparent motion, extend the field of view, and enable entirely new physical gaming experiences. Our system is entirely self-calibrating and is designed to work in any room. We present a detailed exploration of the design space of peripheral projected illusions and we demonstrate ways to trigger and drive such illusions from gaming content. We also contribute specific feedback from two groups of target users (10 gamers and 15 game designers); providing insights for enhancing game experiences through peripheral projected illusions.","

WorldKit: rapid and easy creation of ad-hoc interactive applications on everyday surfaces,"Instant access to computing, when and where we need it, has long been one of the aims of research areas such as ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we describe the WorldKit system, which makes use of a paired depth camera and projector to make ordinary surfaces instantly interactive. Using this system, touch-based interactivity can, without prior calibration, be placed on nearly any unmodified surface literally with a wave of the hand, as can other new forms of sensed interaction. From a user perspective, such interfaces are easy enough to instantiate that they could, if desired, be recreated or modified ""each time we sat down"" by ""painting"" them next to us. From the programmer's perspective, our system encapsulates these capabilities in a simple set of abstractions that make the creation of interfaces quick and easy. Further, it is extensible to new, custom interactors in a way that closely mimics conventional 2D graphical user interfaces, hiding much of the complexity of working in this new domain. We detail the hardware and software implementation of our system, and several example applications built using the library.","

Front-camera video recordings as emotion responses to mobile photos shared within close-knit groups,"People use social-photography services to tell stories about themselves and to solicit responses from viewers. State of the-art services concentrate on textual comments, ""Like"" buttons, or similar means for viewers to give explicit feedback, but they overlook other, non-textual means. This paper investigates how emotion responses--as video clips captured by the front camera of a cell phone and used as tags for the individual photo viewed--can enhance photo-sharing experiences for close-knit groups. Our exploration was carried out with a mobile social-photography service called Social Camera. Four user groups (N=19) used the application for two to four weeks. The study's results support the value of using front-camera video recordings to glean emotion response. It supports lightweight phatic social interactions not possible with comments and ""Like"" buttons. Most users kept sharing emotion responses throughout the study. They typically shared the responses right after they saw a just taken photo received from a remote partner. They used the responses to share their current contexts with others just as much as to convey nuanced feelings about a photo. We discuss the implications for future design and research.","Social Media platforms' overreliance on textual comments and ""Like"" buttons can lead to a lack of nuanced emotional expression and lightweight social interactions, limiting users' ability to share their current contexts and convey complex feelings about a photo.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466125,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Multiple notification modalities and older users,"Multimodal interaction can make home care reminder systems more accessible to their users, most of whom are older and/or have sensory impairments. Existing research into the properties of different notification modalities have used younger participants rather than members of the older population at which they are aimed. This paper presents the results of a user study with older adults that examined how different notification modalities affected (a) performance in a card matching game and (b) how effective the different modalities were at delivering information. Participants were all aged over 50 and notifications were delivered using textual, pictographic, abstract visual, speech, Earcon, Auditory Icon, tactile and olfactory modalities while playing the game. The results showed that older users were influenced by the same factors as younger users, yet there were subjective differences. The implications for the design of multimodal reminder systems for home care are discussed.","

The article highlights the potential for multimodal reminder systems, which use a combination of notification modalities, to be less effective for older adults compared to younger users.

Learning and performance with gesture guides,"Gesture-based interfaces are becoming more prevalent and complex, requiring non-trivial learning of gesture sets. Many methods for learning gestures have been proposed, but they are often evaluated with short-term recall tests that measure user performance, rather than learning. We evaluated four types of gesture guides using a retention and transfer paradigm common in motor learning experiments and found results different from those typically reported with recall tests. The results indicate that many guide systems with higher levels of guidance exhibit high performance benefits while the guide is being used, but are ultimately detrimental to user learning. We propose an adaptive guide that does not suffer from these drawbacks, and that enables a smooth transition from novice to expert. The results contrasting learning and performance can be explained by the guidance hypothesis. They have important implications for the design and evaluation of future gesture learning systems.","Gesture-based interfaces may hinder user learning and expertise development due to over-reliance on guidance, leading to poor retention and transfer of skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466143,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Direct manipulation video navigation in 3D,"Direct Manipulation Video Navigation (DMVN) systems allow a user to navigate a video by dragging an object along its motion trajectory. These systems have been shown effective for space-centric video browsing. Their performance, however, is often limited by temporal ambiguities in a video with complex motion, such as recurring motion, self-intersecting motion, and pauses. The ambiguities come from reducing the 3D spatial-temporal motion (x, y, t) to the 2D spatial motion (x, y) in visualizing the motion and dragging the object. In this paper, we present a 3D DMVN system that maps the spatial-temporal motion (x, y, t) to 3D space (x, y, z) by mapping time t to depth z, visualizes the motion and video frame in 3D, and allows to navigate the video by spatial-temporally manipulating the object in 3D. We show that since our 3D DMVN system preserves all the motion information, it resolves the temporal ambiguities and supports intuitive navigation on challenging videos with complex motion.","

The use of Direct Manipulation Video Navigation (DMVN) systems can lead to confusion and disorientation due to the reduction of 3D spatial-temporal motion to 2D spatial motion, resulting in temporal ambiguities.

Analyzing user-generated youtube videos to understand touchscreen use by people with motor impairments,"Most work on the usability of touchscreen interaction for people with motor impairments has focused on lab studies with relatively few participants and small cross-sections of the population. To develop a richer characterization of use, we turned to a previously untapped source of data: YouTube videos. We collected and analyzed 187 non-commercial videos uploaded to YouTube that depicted a person with a physical disability interacting with a mainstream mobile touchscreen device. We coded the videos along a range of dimensions to characterize the interaction, the challenges encountered, and the adaptations being adopted in daily use. To complement the video data, we also invited the video uploaders to complete a survey on their ongoing use of touchscreen technology. Our findings show that, while many people with motor impairments find these devices empowering, accessibility issues still exist. In addition to providing implications for more accessible touchscreen design, we reflect on the application of user-generated content to study user interface design.","Accessibility issues still exist in touchscreen devices, making it difficult for people with motor impairments to use them effectively.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466158,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Exploring & designing tools to enhance falls rehabilitation in the home,"Falls are the leading cause of accidental injury-related deaths in the elderly; a fall can lead to a loss of independence, and a fear of falling. Rehabilitation programmes involving exercise have proved the most successful way to reduce the risk of falls. However, the limitations of standard care (e.g. booklets) could prevent home users from receiving the full therapeutic benefit that rehabilitation offers. Having consulted users and health experts, we developed games, and visualizations for falls rehabilitation that we believe could potentially overcome the main barriers to effective rehabilitation in the home. In this paper, we describe user studies that we carried out with older adults to evaluate the use of these visual tools versus standard care, both in the laboratory and in the home. Our main findings show that our visualizations and games were able to overcome the major limitations of standard care, and that they were usable and acceptable to the end users.","

HACHIStack: dual-layer photo touch sensing for haptic and auditory tapping interaction,"We present a novel photo touch sensing architecture, HACHIStack. It can measure the approaching velocity of an object and predict its contact time with the touch screen using two optical sensing layers above the surface. The photo sensing layers form three unique capabilities: high-speed sampling, velocity acquisition, and contact time prediction. This work quantitatively examines these capabilities through two laboratory experiments, and confirms that the capabilities of HACHIStack are sufficient for multimodal interaction, in particular, touch-based interaction with haptic enhancement. We then present three applications with HACHIStack: 1) chromatic percussions (xylophone and glockenspiel) with haptic feedback; 2) no-delay haptic feedback with the sensation of tapping on various simulated materials (e.g., rubber, wood and aluminum); and 3) a virtual piano instrument that allows players to perform weak and strong strokes by changing the tapping velocity.","

The technology described in the article, HACHIStack, has the potential to create a false sense of touch and haptic feedback in virtual reality environments. This could lead to a decrease in the user's ability to perceive and understand the physical world, as they become more reliant on virtual sensations. Additionally, the technology could be used to create addictive or manipulative experiences, as users become dependent on the simulated sensations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466187,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Sublimate: state-changing virtual and physical rendering to augment interaction with shape displays,"Recent research in 3D user interfaces pushes towards immersive graphics and actuated shape displays. Our work explores the hybrid of these directions, and we introduce sublimation and deposition, as metaphors for the transitions between physical and virtual states. We discuss how digital models, handles and controls can be interacted with as virtual 3D graphics or dynamic physical shapes, and how user interfaces can rapidly and fluidly switch between those representations. To explore this space, we developed two systems that integrate actuated shape displays and augmented reality (AR) for co-located physical shapes and 3D graphics. Our spatial optical see-through display provides a single user with head-tracked stereoscopic augmentation, whereas our handheld devices enable multi-user interaction through video seethrough AR. We describe interaction techniques and applications that explore 3D interaction for these new modalities. We conclude by discussing the results from a user study that show how freehand interaction with physical shape displays and co-located graphics can outperform wand-based interaction with virtual 3D graphics.","Users may become too reliant on technology and lose touch with reality, leading to decreased social skills and ability to interact with physical objects.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466191,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

This paper outlines a novel design framework for creating reusable ARGs that will help extend the lifespan of ARGs and allow them to permeate new domains such as education. The framework includes three key reusable design objectives (replayability, adaptability, extensibility), each of which can be enacted at different levels of depth.

HeartLink: open broadcast of live biometric data to social networks,"A number of studies in the literature have looked into the use of real-time biometric data to improve one's own physiological performance and wellbeing. However, there is limited research that looks into the effects that sharing biometric data with others could have on one's social network. Following a period of research on existing mobile applications and prototype testing, we developed a system, HeartLink, which collects real-time personal biometric data such as heart rate and broadcasts this data online. Insights gained on designing systems to broadcast real-time biometric data are presented. In this paper we also report emerging results from testing HeartLink in a pilot study and a user study that were conducted during sport events.

Technology preferences and routines for sharing health information during the treatment of a chronic illness,"When a patient has a chronic illness, such as heart disease or cancer, it can be challenging for distributed family members to stay aware of the patient's health status. A variety of technologies are available to support health information sharing (e.g., phone, video chat, social media), yet we still do not have a detailed understanding of which technologies are preferred and what challenges people still face when sharing information with them. To explore this, we conducted a mixed-method study-involving a survey and in-depth interviews--with people about their health information sharing routines and preferences for different technologies. Regardless of physical distance between distributed family members, synchronous methods of communication afforded the opportunity to provide affective support while asynchronous methods of communication were deemed to be the least intrusive. With family members adopting certain roles during the treatment of chronic illnesses, our findings suggest the need to design tools that mediate sharing health information across distance and age gaps, with consideration to respecting patient privacy while sharing health information.","

Instagram at the museum: communicating the museum experience through social photo sharing,"The everyday use of smartphones with high quality built-in cameras has lead to an increase in museum visitors' use of these devices to document and share their museum experiences. In this paper, we investigate how one particular photo sharing application, Instagram, is used to communicate visitors' experiences while visiting a museum of natural history. Based on an analysis of 222 instagrams created in the museum, as well as 14 interviews with the visitors who created them, we unpack the compositional resources and concerns contributing to the creation of instagrams in this particular context. By re-categorizing and re-configuring the museum environment, instagrammers work to construct their own narratives from their visits. These findings are then used to discuss what emerging multimedia practices imply for the visitors' engagement with and documentation of museum exhibits. Drawing upon these practices, we discuss the connection between online social media dialogue and the museum site.","

The effects of tactile feedback and movement alteration on interaction and awareness with digital embodiments,"Collaborative tabletop systems can employ direct touch, where people's real arms and hands manipulate objects, or indirect input, where people are represented on the table with digital embodiments. The input type and the resulting embodiment dramatically influence tabletop interaction: in particular, the touch avoidance that naturally governs people's touching and crossing behavior with physical arms is lost with digital embodiments. One result of this loss is that people are less aware of each others' arms, and less able to coordinate actions and protect personal territories. To determine whether there are strategies that can influence group interaction on shared digital tabletops, we studied augmented digital arm embodiments that provide tactile feedback or movement alterations when people touched or crossed arms. The study showed that both augmentation types changed people's behavior (people crossed less than half as often) and also changed their perception (people felt more aware of the other person's arm, and felt more awkward when touching). This work shows how groupware designers can influence people's interaction, awareness, and coordination abilities when physical constraints are absent.","Loss of personal space and physical boundaries, leading to decreased coordination and increased awkwardness in group interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466250,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship

Applying CARTs to the often large amount of data yielded by online studies can easily provide clarity concerning the most important effects underlying experimental data in situations where myriad possible factors are under consideration. The feedback provided by such an analysis can also provide valuable reflection on the experimental methodology. We discuss these matters with reference to a study of 1300 participants in a structured experiment concerned with head-interaction techniques for first-person-shooter games.,"Over-reliance on technology can lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and social skills.

Visual challenges in the everyday lives of blind people,"The challenges faced by blind people in their everyday lives are not well understood. In this paper, we report on the findings of a large-scale study of the visual questions that blind people would like to have answered. As part of this year-long study, 5,329 blind users asked 40,748 questions about photographs that they took from their iPhones using an application called VizWiz Social. We present a taxonomy of the types of questions asked, report on a number of features of the questions and accompanying photographs, and discuss how individuals changed how they used VizWiz Social over time. These results improve our understanding of the problems blind people face, and may help motivate new projects more accurately targeted to help blind people live more independently in their everyday lives.","Blind people face challenges in their daily lives, and current technology may not be adequately addressing their needs.

SeeSay and HearSay CAPTCHA for mobile interaction,"Speech certainly has advantages as an input modality for smartphone applications, especially in scenarios where using touch or keyboard entry is difficult, on increasingly miniaturized devices where useable keyboards are difficult to accommodate, or in scenarios where only small amounts of text need to be input, such as when entering SMS texts or responding to a CAPTCHA challenge. In this paper, we propose two new alternative ways to design CAPTCHAs in which the user says the answer instead of typing it with (a) output stimuli provided visually (SeeSay) or (b) auditorily (HearSay). Our user study results show that SeeSay CAPTCHA requires less time to be solved and users prefer it over current text-based CAPTCHA methods.","Voice Assistant technology can lead to a decrease in typing skills and an over-reliance on speech-based input methods, potentially hindering users' ability to effectively communicate and interact with technology in various contexts.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481295,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
"Flights in my hands: coherence concerns in designing Strip'TIC, a tangible space for air traffic controllers","We reflect upon the design of a paper-based tangible interactive space to support air traffic control. We have observed, studied, prototyped and discussed with controllers a new mixed interaction system based on Anoto, video projection, and tracking. Starting from the understanding of the benefits of tangible paper strips, our goal is to study how mixed physical and virtual augmented data can support the controllers' mental work. The context of the activity led us to depart from models that are proposed in tangible interfaces research where coherence is based on how physical objects are representative of virtual objects. We propose a new account of coherence in a mixed interaction system that integrates externalization mechanisms. We found that physical objects play two roles: they act both as representation of mental objects and as tangible artifacts for interacting with augmented features. We observed that virtual objects represent physical ones, and not the reverse, and, being virtual representations of physical objects, should seamlessly converge with the cognitive role of the physical object. Finally, we show how coherence is achieved by providing a seamless interactive space.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can lead to a decrease in cognitive abilities, as people rely more on technology and less on their own mental processes. This can result in a loss of critical thinking skills and a decreased ability to problem solve. Additionally, the technology can create a false sense of reality, leading people to become disconnected from the physical world and less aware of their surroundings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481300,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
PixelTone: a multimodal interface for image editing,"Photo editing can be a challenging task, and it becomes even more difficult on the small, portable screens of mobile devices that are now frequently used to capture and edit images. To address this problem we present PixelTone, a multimodal photo editing interface that combines speech and direct manipulation. We observe existing image editing practices and derive a set of principles that guide our design. In particular, we use natural language for expressing desired changes to an image, and sketching to localize these changes to specific regions. To support the language commonly used in photo-editing we develop a customized natural language interpreter that maps user phrases to specific image processing operations. Finally, we perform a user study that evaluates and demonstrates the effectiveness of our interface.","

The use of voice assistants for photo editing can lead to a lack of understanding and control over the editing process, as users may not fully comprehend the specific image processing operations being performed in response to their voice commands. This can result in unexpected or undesired outcomes, and may also limit the user's ability to make precise adjustments to their images.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481301,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Factors impacting community response in an interest-sharing network,"The arrival of a new interest-sharing network, So.cl, provides for a new opportunity to explore human behavior as it relates to constructing public contributions and receiving community response. This study looks at archival data in order to better understand how types of shared content receive interaction from others. The results suggest that a So.cl user should include more photos and less links on their post to increase the quantity of likes and comments the community gives to the post, among other discoveries.","Social Media platforms like So.cl can incentivize users to prioritize posting content that receives more likes and comments, rather than sharing meaningful or informative content.

Augmented letters: mnemonic gesture-based shortcuts,"We propose Augmented Letters, a new technique aimed at augmenting gesture-based techniques such as Marking Menus [9] by giving them natural, mnemonic associations. Augmented Letters gestures consist of the initial of command names, sketched by hand in the Unistroke style, and affixed with a straight tail. We designed a tentative touch device interaction technique that supports fast interactions with large sets of commands, is easily discoverable, improves user's recall at no speed cost, and supports fluid transition from novice to expert mode. An experiment suggests that Augmented Letters outperform Marking Menu in terms of user recall.","

"My profile is my password, verify me!: the privacy/convenience tradeoff of facebook connect","We performed a laboratory experiment to study the privacy tradeoff offered by Facebook Connect: disclosing Facebook profile data to third-party websites for the convenience of logging in without creating separate accounts. We controlled for trustworthiness and amount of information each website requested, as well as the consent dialog layout. We discovered that these factors had no observable effects, likely because participants did not read the dialogs. Yet, 15% still refused to use Facebook Connect, citing privacy concerns. A likely explanation for subjects ignoring the dialogs while also understanding the privacy tradeoff - our exit survey indicated that 88% broadly understood what data would be collected - is that subjects were already familiar with the dialogs prior to the experiment. We discuss how our results demonstrate informed consent, but also how habituation prevented subjects from understanding the nuances between individual websites' data collection policies.","Habituation to privacy consent dialogs can lead to users ignoring important details about data collection, resulting in uninformed decisions about personal data sharing.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481328,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
All the news that's fit to read: a study of social annotations for news reading,"As news reading becomes more social, how do different types of annotations affect people's selection of news articles? This paper reports on results from two experiments looking at social annotations in two different news reading contexts. The first experiment simulates a logged-out experience with annotations from strangers, a computer agent, and a branded company. Results indicate that, perhaps unsurprisingly, annotations by strangers have no persuasive effects. However, surprisingly, unknown branded companies still had a persuasive effect. The second experiment simulates a logged-in experience with annotations from friends, finding that friend annotations are both persuasive and improve user satisfaction over their article selections. In post-experiment interviews, we found that this increased satisfaction is due partly because of the context that annotations add. That is, friend annotations both help people decide what to read, and provide social context that improves engagement. Interviews also suggest subtle expertise effects. We discuss implications for design of social annotation systems and suggestions for future research.","Social Media technology can lead to a decrease in critical thinking and an increase in conformity, as people are more likely to accept and share information without questioning its validity, especially when it comes from sources perceived as credible or popular.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481334,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
"""Shared joy is double joy"": the social practices of user networks within group shopping sites","Group shopping sites are beginning to rise in popularity amongst eCommerce users. Yet we do not know how or why people are using such sites, and whether or not the design of group shopping sites map to the real shopping needs of end users. To address this, we describe an interview study that investigates the friendship networks of people who participate in group shopping sites (e.g., Groupon) with the goal of understanding how to best design for these experiences. Our results show that group shopping sites are predominently used to support social activities; that is, users do not use them first and foremost to find 'deals'. Instead, group shopping sites are used for planning group activities, extending and building friendships, and constructing one's social identity. Based on these findings, we suggest improved social network integration and impression management tools to improve user experience within group shopping sites.","Social media platforms like Groupon are not designed to meet users' real shopping needs, but instead prioritize supporting social activities and building social identity. This can lead to users feeling pressure to conform to certain social norms and expectations, rather than using the platform for its intended purpose.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481335,Social Media,CHI,user experience
"""I need to try this""?: a statistical overview of pinterest","Over the past decade, social network sites have become ubiquitous places for people to maintain relationships, as well as loci of intense research interest. Recently, a new site has exploded into prominence: Pinterest became the fastest social network to reach 10M users, growing 4000% in 2011 alone. While many Pinterest articles have appeared in the popular press, there has been little scholarly work so far. In this paper, we use a quantitative approach to study three research questions about the site. What drives activity on Pinterest? What role does gender play in the site's social connections? And finally, what distinguishes Pinterest from existing networks, in particular Twitter? In short, we find that being female means more repins, but fewer followers, and that four verbs set Pinterest apart from Twitter: use, look, want and need. This work serves as an early snapshot of Pinterest that later work can leverage.","

The article highlights how Pinterest, a social media platform, has grown rapidly and has become a popular place for people to maintain relationships. However, the article also shows that there are differences in how men and women use the platform, with women being more active and having more followers, but also facing a lack of engagement from others. This suggests that there may be a gender bias on the platform, which could be an undesirable consequence for women who use it. Additionally, the article mentions that four verbs, ""use, look, want, and need,"" distinguish Pinterest from Twitter, which could indicate that Pinterest is more focused on consumerism and materialism, which could also be seen as an undesirable consequence.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481336,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Digital portraits: photo-sharing after domestic violence,"This paper explores how technology could support the re-building of lives after domestic violence. We worked in the context of a women's centre where women are accessing support after leaving abusive relationships. The paper contributes a feminist participatory arts action research approach to studying photo-sharing practices and helps to frame an understanding of the ongoing tensions in the construction of self with others that the women experience. We argue that the affirmation of new bonds, control in sharing the process of 'moving on', and supporting discursive negotiations of privacy are important considerations for design focused on interpersonal social processes around the use of digital technology.","

Digital apartheid: an ethnographic account of racialised hci in Cape Town hip-hop,"We describe findings from a 15-month ethnography of hip-hop performers in Cape Town, South Africa. Mobile communications and social media are hugely important to the development of these performers' careers, opening access to collaborators, production tools, audiences and distribution channels. This group go to extraordinary lengths to gain and maintain access to these technologies, often by exploiting their social capital through musical and ethnic networks. We document that even after nearly twenty years of democracy, a ridged separation along racial lines persists, which can be seen in all areas of life including access to and proficiency in digital technologies. We illustrate how hip-hop performers harness these divisions both on and offline in order to distinguish themselves from other artists. Our research raises a number of implications for post-colonial computing, highlighting difficulties related to discontinuous access, and how international preconceptions of identity and authenticity emerge as a consequence of the increased use of communication technology.","Social Media technology can perpetuate racial divisions and discrimination, even in post-colonial societies, as people use it to distinguish themselves from others and maintain social capital.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481350,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Reality jockey: lifting the barrier between alternate realities through audio and haptic feedback,"We present Reality Jockey, a system that confuses the participant's perception of the reality by mixing in a recorded past-reality. The participant will be immersed in a spatialized 3D sound environment that is a mix of sounds from the reality and from the past. The sound environment from the past is augmented with haptic feedback in cross-modality. The haptic feedback is associated with certain sounds such as the vibration in the table when stuff is placed on the table to make the illusion of it happening in live. The seamless transition between live and past creates immersive experience of past events. The blending of live and past allows interactivity. To validate our system, we conducted user studies on 1) does blending live sensations improve such experiences, and 2) how beneficial is it to provide haptic feedbacks in recorded pasts. Potential applications are suggested to illustrate the significance of Reality Jockey.","Confusion of reality and the past, potentially leading to a blurred line between what is real and what is not.

Real-time perception-level translation from audio signals to vibrotactile effects,"In this paper, we propose a real-time perception-level audio-to-vibrotactile translation algorithm. Unlike previous signal-level conversion methods, our algorithm considers only perceptual characteristics, such as loudness and roughness, of audio and tactile stimuli. This perception-level approach allows for designing intuitive and explicit conversion models with clear understandings of their perceptual consequences. Our current implementation is tailored to accurate detection of special sound effects to provide well-synchronized audio-tactile feedback in immersive applications. We also assessed the performance of our translation algorithm in terms of the detection rate of special sound effects, computational performance, and user preference. All the experimental results supported that our algorithm works well as intended with better performance than the signal-level conversion methods, especially for games. Our algorithm can be easily realized in current products, including mobile devices, gaming devices, and 4D home theater systems, for richer user experience.","Users may become too reliant on technology and neglect their natural senses, leading to a decrease in overall sensory perception and potentially harming their ability to interact with the world around them.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481354,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Evaluating the efficiency of physical visualizations,"Data sculptures are an increasingly popular form of physical visualization whose purposes are essentially artistic, communicative or educational. But can physical visualizations help carry out actual information visualization tasks? We present the first infovis study comparing physical to on-screen visualizations. We focus on 3D visualizations, as these are common among physical visualizations but known to be problematic on computers. Taking 3D bar charts as an example, we show that moving visualizations to the physical world can improve users' efficiency at information retrieval tasks. In contrast, augmenting on-screen visualizations with stereoscopic rendering alone or with prop-based manipulation was of limited help. The efficiency of physical visualizations seems to stem from features that are unique to physical objects, such as their ability to be touched and their perfect visual realism. These findings provide empirical motivation for current research on fast digital fabrication and self-reconfiguring interfaces.","

Job opportunities through entertainment: virally spread speech-based services for low-literate users,"We explore how telephone-based services might be mass adopted by low-literate users in the developing world. We focus on speech and push-button dialog systems requiring neither literacy nor training. Building on the success of Polly, a simple telephone-based voice manipulation and forwarding system that was first tested in 2011, we report on its first large-scale sustained deployment. In 24/7 operation in Pakistan since May 9, 2012, as of mid-September Polly has spread to 85,000 users, engaging them in 495,000 interactions, and is continuing to spread to 1,000 new people daily. It has also attracted 27,000 people to a job search service, who in turn listened 279,000 times to job ads and forwarded them 22,000 times to their friends. We report users' activity over time and across demographics, analyze user behavior within several randomized controlled trials, and describe lessons learned regarding spread, scalability and sustainability of telephone-based speech-based services.","

Hustling online: understanding consolidated facebook use in an informal settlement in Nairobi,"Facebook is a global phenomenon, yet little is known about use of the site in urban parts of the developing world where the social network's users are increasingly located. We qualitatively studied Facebook use among 28 young adults living in Viwandani, an informal settlement, or slum, in Nairobi, Kenya. We find that to overcome the costs associated with Internet use, participants consolidated diverse online activities onto Facebook; here we focus on the most common practice--using Facebook to support income generation. Viwandani residents used the site to look for employment opportunities, market themselves, and seek remittances from friends and family abroad. We use our findings to motivate a design agenda for the urban poor built on an understanding that Facebook is used, with mixed-success, to support income generation. A key part of this agenda calls for developing ICT interventions grounded in users' existing practices rather than introducing new and unfamiliar ones.","Facebook use in developing countries may perpetuate poverty and inequality.

Insight: Facebook use in urban areas of developing countries is not just for socializing, but also for income generation. However, the existing practices of using Facebook for income generation may not be effective and may perpetuate poverty and inequality.

Lay summary: Facebook is used by young adults in urban areas of developing countries to find jobs, promote themselves, and get financial help from abroad. However, these efforts may not be successful and may keep people in poverty.

VideoKheti: making video content accessible to low-literate and novice users,"Designing ICT systems for rural users in the developing world is difficult for a variety of reasons ranging from problems with infrastructure to wide differences in user contexts and capabilities. Developing regions may include huge variability in spoken languages, and users are often low- or non-literate, with very little experience interacting with digital technologies. Researchers have explored the use of text-free graphical interfaces as well as speech-based applications to overcome some of the issues related to language and literacy. While there are benefits and drawbacks to each of these approaches, they can be complementary when used together. In this work, we present VideoKheti, a mobile system using speech, graphics, and touch interaction for low-literate farmers in rural India. VideoKheti helps farmers to find and watch agricultural extension videos in their own language and dialect. In this paper, we detail the design and development of VideoKheti and report on a field study with 20 farmers in rural India who were asked to find videos based on a scenario. The results show that farmers could use VideoKheti, but their success still greatly depended on their education level. While participants were enthusiastic about using the system, the multimodal interface did not overcome many obstacles for low-literate users.","
The use of voice assistant technology in rural areas of developing countries can be challenging due to issues with infrastructure, language barriers, and low literacy rates among users. While speech-based applications and graphical interfaces can be helpful, they may not be effective for all users, particularly those with low education levels.

Interview approaches to researching embodiment,"The methods of data collection that we choose determine the kinds of data that we have access to, and thus shape analyses. In the context of novel interfaces where different modes, available through the environment and context, mediate the interaction, understanding methodological approaches is critical. This paper examines alternative methods of data collection for exploring student's embodied interaction with novel technology in a learning context. Specifically it analyses non-facilitated interaction in a tangible learning environment, in conjunction with three different post activity interview approaches: semi-structured interviews; semi-structured interview with video prompted recall; and interviews using the technology itself. Findings suggest that the different interview approaches change the nature of information elicited, and that non-facilitated interaction offers clearer insight into interpretation, both in terms of the meaning that emerges through, and is, therefore, embodied in the interaction, and in terms of representation, directly informing design.","

I feel for my avatar: embodied perception in VEs,"Visual perception is dependent upon one's physical state. The apparent inclination of a hill is overestimated when the observer is carrying a heavy backpack. But, what if the hill is a virtual one and the user is about to navigate the virtual environment through an avatar? In a 2 (user with a backpack vs. user without the backpack) × 2 (avatar with a virtual backpack vs. avatar without a virtual backpack) × 2 (customized avatar vs. assigned avatar) between-subjects experiment (N = 121), participants estimated the hill as being steeper when using a customized avatar rather than an assigned one. When the avatar is encumbered by a heavy virtual backpack, those with a customized avatar perceived the virtual hill as being more difficult to climb. Avatar customization and the physical resources of the avatar (operationalized here in the form of a 'virtual' backpack) were found to be key predictors of embodied perception in virtual environments (VE). This has implications for the design of games and interventions that make use of VEs.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can trick our brains into perceiving virtual objects and environments as real, leading to inaccurate perceptions and potentially harmful consequences. For example, a virtual hill may appear steeper and more difficult to climb than it actually is, causing users to overexert themselves or become discouraged. Additionally, customizing avatars with virtual backpacks may lead users to overestimate the difficulty of virtual tasks, further contributing to negative experiences. These inaccuracies in perception can have negative impacts on user safety, enjoyment, and overall well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466428,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Binocular cursor: enabling selection on transparent displays troubled by binocular parallax,"Binocular parallax is a problem for any interaction system that has a transparent display and objects behind it, as users will see duplicated and overlapped images. In this note, we propose a quantitative measure called Binocular Selectability Discriminant (BSD) to predict the ability of the user to perform selection task in such a setup. In addition, we propose a technique called Binocular Cursor (BC) which takes advantage of this duplicating and overlapping phenomenon, rather than being hampered by it, to resolve binocular selection ambiguity by visualizing the correct selection point. An experiment shows that selection with BC is not slower than monocular selection, and that it can be significantly more precise, depending on the design of BC.","

Studying spatial memory and map navigation performance on projector phones with peephole interaction,"Smartphones are useful personal assistants and omnipresent communication devices. However, collaboration is not among their strengths. With the advent of embedded projectors this might change. We conducted a study with 56 participants to find out if map navigation and spatial memory performance among users and observers can be improved by using a projector phone with a peephole interface instead of a smartphone with its touchscreen interface. Our results show that users performed map navigation equally well on both interfaces. Spatial memory performance, however, was 41% better for projector phone users. Moreover, observers of the map navigation on the projector phone were 25% more accurate when asked to recall locations of points of interest after they watched a user performing map navigation.","

The study suggests that the use of projector phones with a peephole interface for map navigation and spatial memory tasks may lead to a 41% improvement in spatial memory performance compared to traditional smartphones with touchscreen interfaces. However, this improvement comes at the cost of reduced collaboration, as projector phones are not designed for simultaneous use by multiple people. This could lead to a decrease in social interactions and a loss of the benefits that come from working together, such as increased creativity and productivity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466434,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Investigating the use of circles in social networks to support independence of individuals with autism,"Building social support networks is crucial both for less-independent individuals with autism and for their primary caregivers. In this paper, we describe a four-week exploratory study of a social network service (SNS) that allows young adults with autism to garner support from their family and friends. We explore the unique benefits and challenges of using SNSs to mediate requests for help or advice. In particular, we examine the extent to which specialized features of an SNS can engage users in communicating with their network members to get advice in varied situations. Our findings indicate that technology-supported communication particularly strengthened the relationship between the individual and extended network members, mitigating concerns about over-reliance on primary caregivers.

"Limiting, leaving, and (re)lapsing: an exploration of facebook non-use practices and experiences","Despite the abundance of research on social networking sites, relatively little research has studied those who choose not to use such sites. This paper presents results from a questionnaire of over 400 Internet users, focusing specifically on Facebook and those users who have left the service. Results show the lack of a clear, binary distinction between use and non-use, that various practices enable diverse ways and degrees of engagement with and disengagement from Facebook. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals numerous complex and interrelated motivations and justifications, both for leaving and for maintaining some type of connection. These motivations include: privacy, data misuse, productivity, banality, addiction, and external pressures. These results not only contribute to our understanding of online sociality by examining this under-explored area, but they also build on previous work to help advance how we conceptually account for the sociological processes of non-use.","

Predicting postpartum changes in emotion and behavior via social media,"We consider social media as a promising tool for public health, focusing on the use of Twitter posts to build predictive models about the forthcoming influence of childbirth on the behavior and mood of new mothers. Using Twitter posts, we quantify postpartum changes in 376 mothers along dimensions of social engagement, emotion, social network, and linguistic style. We then construct statistical models from a training set of observations of these measures before and after the reported childbirth, to forecast significant postpartum changes in mothers. The predictive models can classify mothers who will change significantly following childbirth with an accuracy of 71%, using observations about their prenatal behavior, and as accurately as 80-83% when additionally leveraging the initial 2-3 weeks of postnatal data. The study is motivated by the opportunity to use social media to identify mothers at risk of postpartum depression, an underreported health concern among large populations, and to inform the design of low-cost, privacy-sensitive early-warning systems and intervention programs aimed at promoting wellness postpartum.","

The study suggests that social media can be used to predict postpartum changes in new mothers, including the risk of postpartum depression. However, this raises concerns about privacy and the potential for social media data to be used to monitor and judge individuals without their consent.

"Understanding motivations for facebook use: usage metrics, network structure, and privacy","This study explores the links between motives for using a social network service and numerical measures of that activity. Specifically, it identified motives for Facebook use by employing a Uses and Gratifications (U&G) approach and then investigated the extent to which these motives can be predicted through usage and network metrics collected automatically via the Facebook API. In total, 11 Facebook usage metrics and eight personal network metrics served as predictors. Results showed that all three variable types in this expanded U&G frame of analysis (covering social antecedents, usage metrics, and personal network metrics) effectively predicted motives and highlighted interesting behaviors. To further illustrate the power of this framework, the intricate nature of privacy in social media was explored and relationships drawn between privacy attitudes (and acts) and measures of use and network structure.","Privacy issues.

The study found that privacy attitudes and acts can be predicted through usage and network metrics collected automatically via the Facebook API, highlighting the potential for privacy violations. This suggests that users may be unaware of the extent to which their personal data is being collected and used, and that they may be vulnerable to targeted advertising and other forms of exploitation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466449,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
How categories come to matter,"In a study of users' interactions with Siri, the iPhone personal assistant application, we noticed the emergence of overlaps and blurrings between explanatory categories such as ""human"" and ""machine"". We found that users work to purify these categories, thus resolving the tensions related to the overlaps. This ""purification work"" demonstrates how such categories are always in flux and are redrawn even as they are kept separate. Drawing on STS analytic techniques, we demonstrate the mechanisms of such ""purification work."" We also describe how such category work remained invisible to us during initial data analysis, due to our own forms of latent purification, and outline the particular analytic techniques that helped lead to this discovery. We thus provide an illustrative case of how categories come to matter in HCI research and design.","

The study found that users work to purify categories of ""human"" and ""machine"" when interacting with Siri, creating tension and blurring the lines between the two. This can lead to an invisible, constant effort to separate the two, even as they are kept separate.

CrashAlert: enhancing peripheral alertness for eyes-busy mobile interaction while walking,"Mobile device use while walking, or eyes-busy mobile interaction, is a leading cause of life-threatening pedestrian collisions. We introduce CrashAlert, a system that augments mobile devices with a depth camera, to provide distance and location visual cues of obstacles on the user's path. In a realistic environment outside the lab, CrashAlert users improve their handling of potential collisions, dodging and slowing down for simple ones while lifting their head in more complex situations. Qualitative results outline the value of extending users' peripheral alertness in eyes-busy mobile interaction through non-intrusive depth cues, as used in CrashAlert. We present the design features of our system and lessons learned from our evaluation.","

Social media and the police: tweeting practices of british police forces during the August 2011 riots,"With this paper we take a first step to understand the appropriation of social media by the police. For this purpose we analyzed the Twitter communication by the London Metropolitan Police (MET) and the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) during the riots in August 2011. The systematic comparison of tweets demonstrates that the two forces developed very different practices for using Twitter. While MET followed an instrumental approach in their communication, in which the police aimed to remain in a controlled position and keep a distance to the general public, GMP developed an expressive approach, in which the police actively decreased the distance to the citizens. In workshops and interviews, we asked the police officers about their perspectives, which confirmed the identified practices. Our study discusses benefits and risks of the two approaches and the potential impact of social media on the evolution of the role of police in society.","Social Media can be used by police to control and manipulate public opinion, creating a distance between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466477,Social Media,CHI,politics
Whoo.ly: facilitating information seeking for hyperlocal communities using social media,"Social media systems promise powerful opportunities for people to connect to timely, relevant information at the hyper local level. Yet, finding the meaningful signal in noisy social media streams can be quite daunting to users. In this paper, we present and evaluate Whoo.ly, a web service that provides neighborhood-specific information based on Twitter posts that were automatically inferred to be hyperlocal. Whoo.ly automatically extracts and summarizes hyperlocal information about events, topics, people, and places from these Twitter posts. We provide an overview of our design goals with Whoo.ly and describe the system including the user interface and our unique event detection and summarization algorithms. We tested the usefulness of the system as a tool for finding neighborhood information through a comprehensive user study. The outcome demonstrated that most participants found Whoo.ly easier to use than Twitter and they would prefer it as a tool for exploring their neighborhoods.",Social media can be overwhelming and difficult to find meaningful information.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2466478,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Regroup: interactive machine learning for on-demand group creation in social networks,"We present ReGroup, a novel end-user interactive machine learning system for helping people create custom, on demand groups in online social networks. As a person adds members to a group, ReGroup iteratively learns a probabilistic model of group membership specific to that group. ReGroup then uses its currently learned model to suggest additional members and group characteristics for filtering. Our evaluation shows that ReGroup is effective for helping people create large and varied groups, whereas traditional methods (searching by name or selecting from an alphabetical list) are better suited for small groups whose members can be easily recalled by name. By facilitating on demand group creation, ReGroup can enable in-context sharing and potentially encourage better online privacy practices. In addition, applying interactive machine learning to social network group creation introduces several challenges for designing effective end-user interaction with machine learning. We identify these challenges and discuss how we address them in ReGroup.","

Social media technology can lead to the creation of large and varied groups, which can make it difficult for users to remember and manage the members of these groups. This can result in users inadvertently sharing information with a large number of people, potentially compromising their privacy. Additionally, the use of interactive machine learning to create groups can introduce challenges for designing effective end-user interaction with machine learning, which can further compromise user privacy and data security.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2207680,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Tales from the front lines of a large-scale serious game project,"Serious games have received much positive attention; correspondingly, many researchers have taken up the challenge of establishing how to best design them. However, the current literature often focuses on best practice design strategies and frameworks. Fine-grained details, contextual descriptions, and organisational factors that are invaluable in helping us to learn from and reflect on project experiences are often overlooked. In this paper, we present five distinct and sometimes competing perspectives that are critical in understanding factors that influence serious game projects: project organisation, technology, domain knowledge, user research, and game design. We explain these perspectives by providing insights from the design and development process of an EU-funded serious game about conflict resolution developed by an interdisciplinary consortium of researchers and industry-based developers. We also point out a set of underlying forces that become evident from viewing the process from different perspectives, to underscore that problems exist in serious game projects and that we should open the conversation about them.","Overemphasis on technology and design can lead to neglect of organizational and contextual factors, resulting in ineffective or unused serious games.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2207688,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Understanding user experience in stereoscopic 3D games,"Recent advances in digital game technology are making stereoscopic games more popular. Stereoscopic 3D graphics promise a better gaming experience but this potential has not yet been proven empirically. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study that evaluates player experience of three stereoscopic games in comparison with their monoscopic counterparts. We examined 60 participants, each playing one of the three games, using three self-reporting questionnaires and one psychophysiological instrument. Our main results are (1) stereoscopy in games increased experienced immersion, spatial presence, and simulator sickness; (2) the effects strongly differed across the three games and for both genders, indicating more affect on male users and with games involving depth animations; (3) results related to attention and cognitive involvement indicate more direct and less thoughtful interactions with stereoscopic games, pointing towards a more natural experience through stereoscopy.",Increased simulator sickness.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2207690,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Augmented perception of satiety: controlling food consumption by changing apparent size of food with augmented reality,"The main contribution of this paper is to realize a method for modifying perception of satiety and controlling nutritional intake by changing the apparent size of food with augmented reality. As a possible method for decreasing rates of obesity, we focused on controlling food intake implicitly without any effort. We hypothesized that ambiguous perception of satiety can be applied to control our food intake. Recent psychological studies have revealed that the amount of food consumed is influenced by both its actual volume and external factors during eating. Based on this knowledge, we sought to control perception of satiety gained from the same amount of food by changing its apparent size. We also proposed a method for food-volume augmentation using real-time shape deformation. Our results suggest that this augmentation can control the perception of satiety and food intake.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can be used to manipulate people's perception of food and control their nutritional intake without their knowledge or effort.

"Keep in touch: channel, expectation and experience","This paper investigates whether and how digitally mediated social touch (remote touch) may influence the sense of connectedness toward a speaker and the emotional experience of what is being communicated. We employ an 'augmented' storytelling methodology where we manipulate the modality of an 'emotive' channel that accompanies the speech, and the contextual expectation of the listener. Comparing a remote upper-arm touch against a similarly timed flashing light, we explore the importance of the touch modality in affect conveyance. Our second manipulation involves two cover stories where the listener is told that the touch or flashing light is triggered either by the storyteller expressively squeezing a touch input device while speaking, or by measured 'high points' in the mental state of the storyteller. Our results show that the story accompanied by communicative touch resulted in a significant increase in the sense of connectedness with the storyteller over the speech-only condition, and a trend toward greater affective conveyance.","
Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can make people feel more connected to a speaker or storyteller, but it can also create a false sense of connection and intimacy. People may feel like they have a deeper relationship with someone they've only interacted with through technology, leading to disappointment or hurt feelings when they meet in person and the connection isn't as strong. Additionally, the use of touch or other sensory inputs in virtual communication can be manipulated to create a false sense of emotional connection, potentially leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the communication.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2207697,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
LightGuide: projected visualizations for hand movement guidance,"LightGuide is a system that explores a new approach to gesture guidance where we project guidance hints directly on a user's body. These projected hints guide the user in completing the desired motion with their body part which is particularly useful for performing movements that require accuracy and proper technique, such as during exercise or physical therapy. Our proof-of-concept implementation consists of a single low-cost depth camera and projector and we present four novel interaction techniques that are focused on guiding a user's hand in mid-air. Our visualizations are designed to incorporate both feedback and feedforward cues to help guide users through a range of movements. We quantify the performance of LightGuide in a user study comparing each of our on-body visualizations to hand animation videos on a computer display in both time and accuracy. Exceeding our expectations, participants performed movements with an average error of 21.6mm, nearly 85% more accurately than when guided by video.","

MirageTable: freehand interaction on a projected augmented reality tabletop,"Instrumented with a single depth camera, a stereoscopic projector, and a curved screen, MirageTable is an interactive system designed to merge real and virtual worlds into a single spatially registered experience on top of a table. Our depth camera tracks the user's eyes and performs a real-time capture of both the shape and the appearance of any object placed in front of the camera (including user's body and hands). This real-time capture enables perspective stereoscopic 3D visualizations to a single user that account for deformations caused by physical objects on the table. In addition, the user can interact with virtual objects through physically-realistic freehand actions without any gloves, trackers, or instruments. We illustrate these unique capabilities through three application examples: virtual 3D model creation, interactive gaming with real and virtual objects, and a 3D teleconferencing experience that not only presents a 3D view of a remote person, but also a seamless 3D shared task space. We also evaluated the user's perception of projected 3D objects in our system, which confirmed that the users can correctly perceive such objects even when they are projected over different background colors and geometries (e.g., gaps, drops).","Users may struggle to distinguish between real and virtual objects, leading to confusion and disorientation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2207704,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Aural browsing on-the-go: listening-based back navigation in large web architectures,"Mobile web navigation requires highly-focused visual attention, which poses problems when it is inconvenient or distracting to continuously look at the screen (e.g., while walking). Aural interfaces support more eyes-free experiences, as users can primarily listen to the content and occasionally look at the device. Yet, designing aural information architectures remains a challenge. Specifically, back navigation is inefficient in the aural setting, as it forces users to listen to each previous page to retrieve the desired content. This paper introduces topic- and list-based back: two navigation strategies to enhance aural browsing. Both are manifest in Green-Savers Mobile (GSM), an aural mobile site. A study (N=29) compared both solutions to traditional back mechanisms. Our findings indicate that topic- and list-based back enable faster access to previous pages, improve the navigation experience and reduce perceived cognitive load. The proposed designs apply to a wide range of content-intensive, ubiquitous web systems.","

"Investigating the presence, form and behavior of virtual possessions in the context of a teen bedroom","Over the past several years, people have acquired more and more virtual possessions. While virtual possessions have become ubiquitous, little work exists to inform designers on how these growing collections should be displayed and how they should behave. We generated four design concepts that changed the form and behavior of these digital things, making them more present within a teen bedroom. We then conducted speed dating sessions to investigate how these new forms and behaviors influence perceptions of value. Sessions revealed how new technologies might better support self-exploration and reflection, as well as how they could complicate identity construction processes. Findings are interpreted to detail opportunities and tensions that can guide future research and practice in this emerging space.","

Yes, I can. Here's a 100-word paragraph that summarizes the undesirable consequence of Augmented/Virtual Reality from the article for a lay audience:

The increase in virtual possessions can make it harder for people to figure out who they are. With so many digital things, it's easy to get lost in the virtual world and forget about the real one. People might start to value their virtual possessions more than their real-life relationships and experiences.

We find that (a) tags created for organizational purposes can be repurposed to create efficient and reasonably accurate access-control rules; (b) users tagging with access control in mind develop coherent strategies that lead to significantly more accurate rules than those associated with organizational tags alone; and (c) participants can understand and actively engage with the concept of tag-based access control.","Users may struggle to properly configure access control for their photos on social media, leading to unintended sharing of personal information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2207728,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy

Fighting for my space: coping mechanisms for sns boundary regulation,"Sharing information online via social network sites (SNSs) is at an all-time high, yet research shows that users often exhibit a marked dissatisfaction in using such sites.

Our research investigates users' SNS boundary regulation behavior. This paper presents results from a qualitative interview-based study to identify ""coping mechanisms"" that users devise outside explicit boundary-regulation interface features in order to manage interpersonal boundaries.

It's complicated: how romantic partners use facebook,"Romantic partners face issues of relational development including managing information privacy, tension between individual and relational needs, and accountability to existing friends. Prior work suggests that affordances of social media might highlight and shape these tensions; to explore this, we asked 20 people to reflect daily for two weeks on feelings and decisions around their own and others' Facebook use related to their relationships. Most generally, we find that tensions arise when romantic partners must manage multiple relationships simultaneously because Facebook audiences are so present and so varied. People also engage in subtle negotiation around and appropriation of Facebook's features to accomplish both personal and relational goals. By capturing both why people make these decisions and how Facebook's affordances support them, we expect our findings to generalize to many other social media tools and to inform theorizing about how these tools affect relational development.",Social Media can create tension in romantic relationships due to the need to manage multiple relationships simultaneously and negotiate the use of features to accomplish personal and relational goals.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2207788,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Bimanual marking menu for near surface interactions,"We describe a mouseless, near-surface version of the Bimanual Marking Menu system. To activate the menu system, users create a pinch gesture with either their index or middle finger to initiate a left click or right click. Then they mark in the 3D space near the interactive area. We demonstrate how the system can be implemented using a commodity range camera such as the Microsoft Kinect, and report on several designs of the 3D marking system. Like the multi-touch marking menu, our system offers a large number of accessible commands. Since it does not rely on contact points to operate, our system leaves the non-dominant hand available for other multi-touch interactions.","

The system described in the article could potentially lead to a decrease in hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills, as users rely more on gestures and less on physical contact with surfaces.

Twiage: a game for finding good advice on twitter,"Millions of recommendations, opinions and experiences are shared across popular microblogging platforms and services each day. Yet much of this content becomes quickly lost in the stream shortly after being posted. This paper looks at the feasibility of identifying useful content in microblog streams so that it might be archived to facilitate wider access and reference. Towards this goal, we present an experiment with a game-with-a-purpose called Twiage that we designed to determine how well the deluge of content in ""raw"" microblog streams could be turned into filtered and ranked collections using ratings from players. Experiments with Twiage validate the feasibility of applying human-computation to this problem, finding strong agreement about what constitutes the ""most useful"" content in our test dataset. Second, we compare the effectiveness of various methods of eliciting such ratings, finding that a ""choose-best"" interface and Elo rating ranking scheme yield the greatest agreement in the fewest rounds. External validation of resulting top-rated twitter content with a domain expert found that while the top Twiage-ranked ""tweets"" were among the best of the set, there was a tendency for players to also select what we term ""weak spam"" - e.g., promotional content disguised as articles or reviews, indicating a need for more stringent content filtering.","

Talking in circles: selective sharing in google+,"Online social networks have become indispensable tools for information sharing, but existing 'all-or-nothing' models for sharing have made it difficult for users to target information to specific parts of their networks. In this paper, we study Google+, which enables users to selectively share content with specific 'Circles' of people. Through a combination of log analysis with surveys and interviews, we investigate how active users organize and select audiences for shared content. We find that these users frequently engaged in selective sharing, creating circles to manage content across particular life facets, ties of varying strength, and interest-based groups. Motivations to share spanned personal and informational reasons, and users frequently weighed ''limiting' factors (e.g. privacy, relevance, and social norms) against the desire to reach a large audience. Our work identifies implications for the design of selective sharing mechanisms in social networks.","Social Media platforms like Google+ can make users feel like they have to share content with specific groups of people, leading to pressure to present a certain image or identity to certain people.

Social annotations in web search,"We ask how to best present social annotations on search results, and attempt to find an answer through mixed-method eye-tracking and interview experiments. Current practice is anchored on the assumption that faces and names draw attention; the same presentation format is used independently of the social connection strength and the search query topic. The key findings of our experiments indicate room for improvement. First, only certain social contacts are useful sources of information, depending on the search topic. Second, faces lose their well-documented power to draw attention when rendered small as part of a social search result annotation. Third, and perhaps most surprisingly, social annotations go largely unnoticed by users in general due to selective, structured visual parsing behaviors specific to search result pages. We conclude by recommending improvements to the design and content of social annotations to make them more noticeable and useful.","Social Media technology can lead to users ignoring important information, such as social annotations, due to selective and structured visual parsing behaviors.

Improving literacy in developing countries using speech recognition-supported games on mobile devices,"Learning to read in a second language is challenging, but highly rewarding. For low-income children in developing countries, this task can be significantly more challenging because of lack of access to high-quality schooling, but can potentially improve economic prospects at the same time. A synthesis of research findings suggests that practicing recalling and vocalizing words for expressing an intended meaning could improve word reading skills - including reading in a second language - more than silent recognition of what the given words mean. Unfortunately, many language learning software do not support this instructional approach, owing to the technical challenges of incorporating speech recognition support to check that the learner is vocalizing the correct word. In this paper, we present results from a usability test and two subsequent experiments that explore the use of two speech recognition-enabled mobile games to help rural children in India read words with understanding. Through a working speech recognition prototype, we discuss two major contributions of this work: first, we give empirical evidence that shows the extent to which productive training (i.e. vocalizing words) is superior to receptive vocabulary training, and discuss the use of scaffolding hints to """"unpack"""" factors in the learner's linguistic knowledge that may impact reading.

Senior designers: empowering seniors to design enjoyable falls rehabilitation tools,"Studies have shown that functional strength and balance exercises can reduce the risk of falling in older people if they are done on a regular basis. However, the repetitive nature of these exercises; as well as the use of instructional booklets and videos for rehabilitation may discourage seniors to exercise in the home, thereby rendering such an intervention ineffective. Our work proposed that the use of multimodal games -- co-designed with seniors -- could be a way of making falls rehabilitation more enjoyable; thereby improving adherence to home exercise programmes. In this paper, we first explain the process by which we identified barriers to the users' effective interaction with current home rehabilitation tools. We then go on to describe how we actively involved seniors in the initial design, and improvement of useful, enjoyable games for falls rehabilitation. Our findings suggest that seniors are an integral part of the design process and should be directly involved from the concept stages of the design of tools for their rehabilitation.",Lack of adherence to home exercise programs for falls rehabilitation due to repetitive nature and unengaging format of traditional exercises and instructional materials.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208568,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
PULSE: the design and evaluation of an auditory display to provide a social vibe,"We present PULSE, a mobile application designed to allow users to gain a 'vibe', an intrinsic understanding of the people, places and activities around their current location, derived from messages on the Twitter social networking site. We compared two auditory presentations of the vibe. One presented message metadata implicitly through modification of spoken message attributes. The other presented the same metadata, but through additional auditory cues. We compared both techniques in a lab and real world study. Additional auditory cues were found to allow for smaller changes in metadata to be more accurately detected, but were least preferred when PULSE was used in context. Results also showed that PULSE enhanced and shaped user understanding, with audio presentation allowing a closer coupling of digital data to the physical world.","

Social Media technology can manipulate users' perceptions and understanding of their surroundings by altering the way information is presented to them. The PULSE application, for example, can change the way users perceive their environment by modifying the attributes of spoken messages, creating a potentially false or biased ""vibe"" of the people, places, and activities around them. This can lead to a distorted view of reality and a loss of personal autonomy.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208580,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Going beyond the surface: studying multi-layer interaction above the tabletop,"Lightweight spatially aware displays (Tangible Magic Lenses) are an effective approach for exploring complex information spaces within a tabletop environment. One way of using the 3D space above a horizontal surface is to divide it into discrete parallel layers stacked upon each other. Horizontal and vertical lens movements are essential tasks for the style of multi-layer interaction associated with it. We conducted a comprehensive user study with 18 participants investigating fundamental issues such as optimal number of layers and their thickness, movement and holding accuracies, and physical boundaries of the interaction volume. Findings include a rather limited overall interaction height (44 cm), a different minimal layer thickness for vertical and horizontal search tasks (1 cm/4 cm), a reasonable maximum number of layers depending on the primary task, and a convenience zone in the middle for horizontal search. Derived from that, design guidelines are also presented.","Users may experience physical limitations and discomfort when interacting with virtual objects in augmented reality, such as limited interaction height and fatigue from holding arms up.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208583,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
A handle bar metaphor for virtual object manipulation with mid-air interaction,"Commercial 3D scene acquisition systems such as the Microsoft Kinect sensor can reduce the cost barrier of realizing mid-air interaction. However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the Kinect sensor's low image resolution. A comprehensive repertoire of 3D manipulation operations is proposed to manipulate single objects, perform fast constrained rotation, and pack/align multiple objects along a line. Three user studies were devised to demonstrate the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed interaction techniques on different virtual manipulation scenarios.","

The use of virtual reality technology can lead to a decrease in the ability to interact with physical objects and a reliance on technology to perform tasks that were previously done manually. This can result in a loss of fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination, as well as a decrease in the ability to problem solve and think critically. Additionally, the use of virtual reality can lead to a sense of disconnection from the physical world and a decrease in social interactions, as people become more focused on the virtual environment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208585,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Examining technology that supports community policing,"This paper investigates how citizens use technology to support community policing efforts. To explore the types of conversations that are shared on the community web forum, we conducted a qualitative study. We analyzed 865 forum posts from a community crime web forum from April 2004 to June 2011. We found that residents use the forum to: 1) build relationships by strengthening social ties, 2) discuss ways to take collective action, 3) share information and advice, and 4) regulate the social norms of the neighborhood and the web forum. Results suggest that technologies intended for crime prevention should be designed to support communication and problem-solving discussions amongst residents, as opposed to simply providing information to citizens.","Social Media can actually decrease community involvement in crime prevention efforts. The study found that residents were more likely to use the forum to build relationships and discuss ways to take collective action, but not necessarily to report crimes or provide information to the authorities. This suggests that Social Media can create a false sense of security and community, leading to a decrease in real-world action and engagement.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208595,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Profanity use in online communities,"As user-generated Web content increases, the amount of inappropriate and/or objectionable content also grows. Several scholarly communities are addressing how to detect and manage such content: research in computer vision focuses on detection of inappropriate images, natural language processing technology has advanced to recognize insults. However, profanity detection systems remain flawed. Current list-based profanity detection systems have two limitations. First, they are easy to circumvent and easily become stale - that is, they cannot adapt to misspellings, abbreviations, and the fast pace of profane slang evolution. Secondly, they offer a one-size fits all solution; they typically do not accommodate domain, community and context specific needs. However, social settings have their own normative behaviors - what is deemed acceptable in one community may not be in another. In this paper, through analysis of comments from a social news site, we provide evidence that current systems are performing poorly and evaluate the cases on which they fail. We then address community differences regarding creation/tolerance of profanity and suggest a shift to more contextually nuanced profanity detection systems.","Inappropriate and objectionable content on social media, including profanity, insults, and inappropriate images, can be difficult to detect and manage, leading to a one-size-fits-all approach that may not accommodate different community norms and contexts.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208610,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
"""I can't get no sleep"": discussing #insomnia on twitter","Emerging research has shown that social media services are being used as tools to disclose a range of personal health information. To explore the role of social media in the discussion of mental health issues, and with particular reference to insomnia and sleep disorders, a corpus of 18,901 messages - or Tweets - posted to the microblogging social media service Twitter were analysed using a mixed methods approach. We present a content analysis which revealed that Tweets that contained the word ""insomnia"" contained significantly more negative health information than a random sample, strongly suggesting that individuals were making disclosures about their sleep disorder. A subsequent thematic analysis then revealed two themes: coping with insomnia, and describing the experience of insomnia. We discuss these themes as well as the implications of our research for those in the interaction design community interested in integrating online social media systems in health interventions.","Social media platforms may encourage individuals to disclose personal health information, including sensitive information about mental health, without proper context or support.

Introducing the ambivalent socialiser,"Social interaction can be a powerful strategy for persuasive technology interventions, yet many users are reluctant to engage with others online because they fear pressure, failure and shame. We introduce the 'ambivalent socialiser', a person who is simultaneously keen but also reluctant to engage with others via social media. Our contribution is to identify four approaches to introducing sociality to ambivalent socialisers: structured socialising, incidental socialising, eavesdropping and trace sensing. We discuss the rationale for these approaches and show how they address recent critiques of persuasive technology. Furthermore, we provide actionable insights for designers of persuasive technology by showing how these approaches can be implemented in a social media application.","Fear of pressure, failure, and shame when interacting online.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208613,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Twitter and the development of an audience: those who stay on topic thrive!,"Although economists have long recognized the importance of a critical mass in growing a community, we know little about how it is achieved. This paper examines how initial topical focus influences communities' ability to attract a critical mass. When starting an online community, organizers need to define its initial scope. Topically narrow communities will probably attract a homogeneous group of interested in its content and compatible with each other. However, they are likely to attract fewer members than a diverse one because they offer only a subset of the topics. This paper reports an empirical analysis of longitudinal data collected from Twitter, where each new Twitter poster is considered the seed of a potential social collection. Users who focus the topics of their early tweets more narrowly ultimately attract more followers with more ties among them. Our results shed light on the development of online social networking structures.","Social Media platforms may attract a homogeneous group of people with similar interests and values, leading to a lack of diversity and potential for echo chambers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208614,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
#EpicPlay: crowd-sourcing sports video highlights,"During a live sports event, many sports fans use social media as a part of their viewing experience, reporting on their thoughts on the event as it unfolds. In this work, we use this information stream to semantically annotate live broadcast sports games, using these annotations to select video highlights from the game. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to select highlights specific for fans of each team, and that these clips reflect the emotions of a fan during a game. Further, we describe how these clips differ from those seen on nightly sportscasts.","Social media can distract sports fans from fully experiencing live events, potentially diminishing their enjoyment and engagement with the game.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208622,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Implicit imitation in social tagging: familiarity and semantic reconstruction,"Social Tagging is a recent widespread phenomenon on the Web where people assign labels (tags) to Web resources. It has been hypothesized to support collaborative sensemaking. In this paper, we examine some of the cognitive mechanisms assumed to underlie sensemaking, namely social imitation. In line with the semantic imitation model of Fu et al., we assume that implicit processing can be understood as a semantic reconstruction of gist. Our model contrasts this process with a recall of tags from an explicit verbatim memory trace. We tested this model in an experimental study in which after the search task students had to generate tags themselves. We exposed their answers to a multinomial model derived from Fuzzy Trace Theory to obtain independent parameter estimates for the processes of explicit recall, semantic gist reconstruction and familiarity-based recall. A model that assumes all processes are at play explains the data well. Similar to results of our previous study, we find an influence of search intentions on the two processes. Our results have implications for interface and interaction design of social tagging systems, as well as for tag recommendation in these environments.","Social Media can lead to the spread of misinformation and the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes through the use of tags and labels, which can be used to manipulate people's perceptions and beliefs.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208287,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Virtual projection: exploring optical projection as a metaphor for multi-device interaction,"Handheld optical projectors provide a simple way to overcome the limited screen real-estate on mobile devices. We present virtual projection (VP), an interaction metaphor inspired by how we intuitively control the position, size, and orientation of a handheld optical projector's image. VP is based on tracking a handheld device without an optical projector and allows selecting a target display on which to position, scale, and orient an item in a single gesture. By relaxing the optical projection metaphor, we can deviate from modeling perspective projection, for example, to constrain scale or orientation, create multiple copies, or offset the image. VP also supports dynamic filtering based on the projection frustum, creating overview and detail applications, and selecting portions of a larger display for zooming and panning. We show exemplary use cases implemented using our optical feature-tracking framework and present the results of a user study demonstrating the effectiveness of VP in complex interactions with large displays.","

The technology can be used to manipulate people's perception and create false or misleading information, leading to confusion and misunderstandings. It can also be used to create multiple copies of the same image, which can be misleading and create a false sense of reality. Additionally, the technology can be used to create overview and detail applications, which can be overwhelming and make it difficult for people to focus on the most important information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208297,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Instructing people for training gestural interactive systems,"Entertainment and gaming systems such as the Wii and XBox Kinect have brought touchless, body-movement based interfaces to the masses. Systems like these enable the estimation of movements of various body parts from raw inertial motion or depth sensor data. However, the interface developer is still left with the challenging task of creating a system that recognizes these movements as embodying meaning. The machine learning approach for tackling this problem requires the collection of data sets that contain the relevant body movements and their associated semantic labels. These data sets directly impact the accuracy and performance of the gesture recognition system and should ideally contain all natural variations of the movements associated with a gesture. This paper addresses the problem of collecting such gesture datasets. In particular, we investigate the question of what is the most appropriate semiotic modality of instructions for conveying to human subjects the movements the system developer needs them to perform. The results of our qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate that the choice of modality has a significant impact on the performance of the learnt gesture recognition system; particularly in terms of correctness and coverage.","
The use of machine learning for gesture recognition in augmented/virtual reality technology can lead to inaccurate and biased results due to the limitations of the data sets used to train the system.

DiskPlay: in-track navigation on turntables,"Although digital media playback and storage have several advantages, many DJs still prefer using vinyl records on turntables due to their direct manipulation and haptic qualities. The physical structure of a traditional vinyl record provides important cues for in-track navigation, such as track length or location of loud and soft passages. Digital vinyl systems use a timecode record to combine the advantages of digital playback with the handling DJs are used to. These records contain a special audio signal that is processed by a computer and mapped to information such as playback speed, direction, and absolute position in a track. However, due to their generic nature, timecode records cannot provide visual information to navigate inside individual tracks. Using top-projection, DiskPlay augments a white timecode record with individual visual cues of the medium, such as cue points or track start and end. In our observational study with four professional DJs, participants valued the co-location of visual feedback with the control vinyl on the turntable.","

IllumiShare: sharing any surface,"Task and reference spaces are important communication channels for remote collaboration. However, all existing systems for sharing these spaces have an inherent weakness: they cannot share arbitrary physical and digital objects on arbitrary surfaces. We present IllumiShare, a new cost-effective, light-weight device that solves this issue. It both shares physical and digital objects on arbitrary surfaces and provides rich referential awareness. To evaluate IllumiShare, we studied pairs of children playing remotely. They used IllumiShare to share the task-reference space and Skype Video to share the person space. The study results show that IllumiShare shared the play space in a natural and seamless way. We also found that children preferred having both spaces compared to having only one. Moreover, we found that removing the task-reference space caused stronger negative disruptions to the play task and engagement level than removing the person space. Similarly, we found that adding the task-reference space resulted in stronger positive disruptions.","

The study found that when children used IllumiShare to share a task-reference space, they became more disrupted and less engaged when the task-reference space was removed, compared to when the person space was removed.

Shake'n'sense: reducing interference for overlapping structured light depth cameras,"We present a novel yet simple technique that mitigates the interference caused when multiple structured light depth cameras point at the same part of a scene. The technique is particularly useful for Kinect, where the structured light source is not modulated. Our technique requires only mechanical augmentation of the Kinect, without any need to modify the internal electronics, firmware or associated host software. It is therefore simple to replicate. We show qualitative and quantitative results highlighting the improvements made to interfering Kinect depth signals. The camera frame rate is not compromised, which is a problem in approaches that modulate the structured light source. Our technique is non-destructive and does not impact depth values or geometry. We discuss uses for our technique, in particular within instrumented rooms that require simultaneous use of multiple overlapping fixed Kinect cameras to support whole room interactions.","Interference caused by multiple structured light depth cameras pointing at the same scene can compromise the accuracy of depth signals, leading to problems in applications that require simultaneous use of multiple overlapping fixed Kinect cameras, such as instrumented rooms for whole room interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208335,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

Looking at you: fused gyro and face tracking for viewing large imagery on mobile devices,"We present a touch-free interface for viewing large imagery on mobile devices. In particular, we focus on viewing paradigms for 360 degree panoramas, parallax image sequences, and long multi-perspective panoramas. We describe a sensor fusion methodology that combines face tracking using a front-facing camera with gyroscope data to produce a robust signal that defines the viewer's 3D position relative to the display. The gyroscopic data provides both low-latency feedback and allows extrapolation of the face position beyond the the field-of-view of the front-facing camera.

To switch or not to switch: understanding social influence in online choices,"We designed and ran an experiment to measure social influence in online recommender systems, specifically how often people's choices are changed by others' recommendations when facing different levels of confirmation and conformity pressures. In our experiment participants were first asked to provide their preferences between pairs of items. They were then asked to make second choices about the same pairs with knowledge of others' preferences. Our results show that others people's opinions significantly sway people's own choices. The influence is stronger when people are required to make their second decision sometime later (22.4%) than immediately (14.1%). Moreover, people seem to be most likely to reverse their choices when facing a moderate, as opposed to large, number of opposing opinions. Finally, the time people spend making the first decision significantly predicts whether they will reverse their decisions later on, while demographics such as age and gender do not. These results have implications for consumer behavior research as well as online marketing strategies.","Social media can influence people's choices and decisions, often leading them to conform to others' opinions, even when those opinions go against their own initial preferences.

Voice typing: a new speech interaction model for dictation on touchscreen devices,"Dictation using speech recognition could potentially serve as an efficient input method for touchscreen devices. However, dictation systems today follow a mentally disruptive speech interaction model: users must first formulate utterances and then produce them, as they would with a voice recorder. Because utterances do not get transcribed until users have finished speaking, the entire output appears and users must break their train of thought to verify and correct it. In this paper, we introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where users' utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification. For fast correction, users leverage a marking menu using touch gestures. Voice Typing aspires to create an experience akin to having a secretary type for you, while you monitor and correct the text. In a user study where participants composed emails using both Voice Typing and traditional dictation, they not only reported lower cognitive demand for Voice Typing but also exhibited 29% relative reduction of user corrections. Overall, they also preferred Voice Typing.","Dictation systems today require users to formulate utterances and produce them in a single take, leading to mental disruption and errors.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208386,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
"""We've bin watching you"": designing for reflection and social persuasion to promote sustainable lifestyles","BinCam is a social persuasive system to motivate reflection and behavioral change in the food waste and recycling habits of young adults. The system replaces an existing kitchen refuse bin and automatically logs disposed of items through digital images captured by a smart phone installed on the underside of the bin lid.

In this paper we develop and investigate new methods for filtering and assessing the verity of sources found through social media by journalists. We take a human centered design approach to developing a system, SRSR (""Seriously Rapid Source Review""), informed by journalistic practices and knowledge of information production in events. We then used the system, together with a realistic reporting scenario, to evaluate the filtering and visual cue features that we developed.

TeleHuman: effects of 3d perspective on gaze and pose estimation with a life-size cylindrical telepresence pod,"In this paper, we present TeleHuman, a cylindrical 3D display portal for life-size human telepresence. The TeleHuman 3D videoconferencing system supports 360 degree motion parallax as the viewer moves around the cylinder and optionally, stereoscopic 3D display of the remote person. We evaluated the effect of perspective cues on the conveyance of nonverbal cues in two experiments using a one-way telecommunication version of the system. The first experiment focused on how well the system preserves gaze and hand pointing cues. The second experiment evaluated how well the system conveys 3D body postural information. We compared 3 perspective conditions: a conventional 2D view, a 2D view with 360 degree motion parallax, and a stereoscopic view with 360 degree motion parallax. Results suggest the combined presence of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues significantly improved the accuracy with which participants were able to assess gaze and hand pointing cues, and to instruct others on 3D body poses. The inclusion of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues also led to significant increases in the sense of social presence and telepresence reported by participants.","

We suggest that the use of such 360 degree displays in a telepresence system has two key advantages: it is possible to understand the identity of the visitor from any viewpoint; and with suitable graphical representation, it is possible to tell where the visitor is looking from any viewpoint. In this paper, we investigate how to optimally represent a visitor as an avatar on a spherical display by evaluating how varying representations are able to accurately convey head gaze.","

The use of telepresence robots and 360-degree displays in augmented/virtual reality technology can lead to a loss of privacy for remote visitors. Their surroundings and movements can be captured and transmitted back to the visitor, potentially invading their privacy and creating a sense of discomfort or vulnerability. Additionally, the use of avatars to represent visitors may not accurately convey their head gaze or identity, leading to confusion or miscommunication.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208642,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
360° panoramic overviews for location-based services,"We investigate 360° panoramas as overviews to support users in the task of locating objects in the surrounding environment. Panoramas are typically visualized as rectangular photographs, but this does not provide clear cues for physical directions in the environment. In this paper, we conduct a series of studies with three different shapes: Frontal, Top-Down and Bird's Eye; the last two shapes are chosen because they provide a clearer representation of the spatial mapping between panorama and environment. Our results show that good readability of the panorama is most important and that a clear representation of the spatial mapping plays a secondary role. This paper is the first to provide understanding on how users exploit 360° panoramic over-views to locate objects in the surrounding environment and how different design factors can affect user performance.","

The use of 360° panoramas in AR/VR technology can lead to confusion and disorientation for users, as the visual representation of the environment can be unclear and disconnected from the physical space. This can result in users having difficulty navigating and locating objects in the real world, potentially leading to accidents or injuries. Additionally, the reliance on panoramas can create a false sense of familiarity and comfort, causing users to become less aware of their surroundings and more dependent on technology, ultimately leading to a decrease in spatial awareness and problem-solving skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208645,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
On the use of virtual environments for the evaluation of location-based applications,"User experience (UX) research on pervasive technologies faces considerable challenges regarding today's mobile context-sensitive applications: evaluative field studies lack control, whereas lab studies miss the interaction with a dynamic context. This dilemma has inspired researchers to use virtual environments (VEs) to acquire control while offering the user a rich contextual experience. Although promising, these studies are mainly concerned with usability and the technical realization of their setup. Furthermore, previous setups leave room for improvement regarding the user's immersive experience. This paper contributes to this line of research by presenting a UX case study on mobile advertising with a novel CAVE-smartphone interface. We conducted two experiments in which we evaluated the intrusiveness of a mobile location-based advertising app in a virtual supermarket. The results confirm our hypothesis that context-congruent ads lessen the experienced intrusiveness thereby demonstrating that our setup is capable of generating preliminary meaningful results with regards to UX. Furthermore, we share insights in conducting these studies.","

The use of virtual environments in research studies may lead to a lack of control and realism in the results, as participants may not interact with the technology in the same way as they would in real life. Additionally, the technical realization of these setups can be complex and may not accurately reflect the user's immersive experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208646,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
The impact of three interfaces for 360-degree video on spatial cognition,"In this paper, we describe an experiment designed to evaluate the effectiveness of three interfaces for surveillance or remote control using live 360-degree video feeds from a person or vehicle in the field. Video feeds are simulated using a game engine. While locating targets within a 3D terrain using a 2D 360-degree interface, participants indicated perceived egocentric directions to targets and later placed targets on an overhead view of the terrain. Interfaces were compared based on target finding and map placement performance. Results suggest 1) non-seamless interfaces with visual boundaries facilitate spatial understanding, 2) correct perception of self-to-object relationships is not correlated with understanding object-to-object relationships within the environment, and 3) increased video game experience corresponds with better spatial understanding of an environment observed in 360-degrees. This work can assist researchers of panoramic video systems in evaluating the optimal interface for observation and teleoperation of remote systems.","

The use of 360-degree video feeds for surveillance or remote control can lead to confusion and disorientation, as users may have difficulty understanding the spatial relationships between objects within the environment. This can be particularly problematic in situations where accurate spatial awareness is critical, such as in emergency response or military operations. Additionally, the use of non-seamless interfaces with visual boundaries can actually facilitate spatial understanding, but may also lead to a sense of disconnection from the environment being observed.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208647,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
MOSOCO: a mobile assistive tool to support children with autism practicing social skills in real-life situations,"MOSOCO is a mobile assistive application that uses augmented reality and the visual supports of a validated curriculum, the Social Compass, to help children with autism practice social skills in real-life situations. In this paper, we present the results of a seven-week deployment study of MOSOCO in a public school in Southern California with both students with autism and neurotypical students. The results of our study demonstrate that MOSOCO facilitates practicing and learning social skills, increases both quantity and quality of social interactions, reduces social and behavioral missteps, and enables the integration of children with autism in social groups of neurotypical children. The findings from this study reveal emergent practices of the uses of mobile assistive technologies in real-life situations.","

Designing social translucence over social networks,"Social translucence is a landmark theory in social computing. Modeled on physical life, it guides designers toward elegant social technologies. However, we argue that it breaks down over modern social network sites because social networks resist its physical metaphors. In this paper, we build theory relating social translucence to social network structure. To explore this idea, we built a tool called Link Different. Link Different addresses a structural awareness problem by letting users know how many of their Twitter followers already a saw link via someone else they follow. During two months on the web, nearly 150K people used the site a total of 1.3M times. Its widespread, viral use suggests that people want social translucence, but network structure gets in the way. We conclude the paper by illustrating new design problems that lie at the intersection of social translucence and other unexplored network structures.","Social Media can make people feel like they're in a fishbowl, where everything they do is visible to everyone else, leading to a lack of privacy and feeling of always being ""on stage.""",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208670,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy

We are interested in how employees use these tools and whether they consider then useful for organizational communication and information-gathering. Our study is longitudinal and based on random sampling. Between 2008 and 2011, social networking went from being a niche activity to being very widely and heavily used. Growth in use and acceptance was not uniform, with differences based on gender, age and level (individual contributor vs. manager).

Breaking news on twitter,"After the news of Osama Bin Laden's death leaked through Twitter, many people wondered if Twitter would fundamentally change the way we produce, spread, and consume news. In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of how the news broke and spread on Twitter. We confirm the claim that Twitter broke the news first, and find evidence that Twitter had convinced a large number of its audience before mainstream media confirmed the news. We also discover that attention on Twitter was highly concentrated on a small number of ""opinion leaders"" and identify three groups of opinion leaders who played key roles in spreading the news: individuals affiliated with media played a large part in breaking the news, mass media brought the news to a wider audience and provided eager Twitter users with content on external sites, and celebrities helped to spread the news and stimulate conversation. Our findings suggest Twitter has great potential as a news medium.","Social media platforms like Twitter can spread misinformation and propaganda quickly and widely, often before fact-checking and verification by mainstream media.

The twitter mute button: a web filtering challenge,"The microblogging service Twitter has become an important, and sometimes primary, source of information for many users. As a forum for sharing news and discussing events, it can provide instant access to the latest updates, but this is not always welcome. In the case of television shows or live sporting events, for example, tweets about them may reveal spoilers to users in different time zones or who are delaying their viewing until later. More broadly, because Twitter is a broadcast medium, users may often want to temporarily or permanently hide content about a very specific given topic. In this paper, we describe the unique challenges to HCI, social computing, and computational linguistics posed by the task of building an interface that blocks all tweets about a specific event or topic. We illustrate some of the challenges through a pilot experiment run for three major television events: the 2009 NFC Championship football game, the 2010 mid-season finale of the show Glee, and the 2010 season premiere of the show 24. While simple techniques achieve very high recall (>98%), spoilers still make it through the filter and precision is extremely poor. We conclude with a description of challenges to the community in implementing this new and increasingly important feature.",Social Media can spoil live events for users in different time zones or who are delaying their viewing until later.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208673,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Narratives of satisfying and unsatisfying experiences of current mobile augmented reality applications,"Over the last few years, mobile applications demonstrating Augmented Reality (AR) - such as Layar, Junaio and Google Goggles - have been introduced to consumers. We conducted an online survey to explore the user experience (UX) of early stage mobile AR applications available in the market in spring 2011, covering both location-based AR browsers and image recognition AR applications for object-based interaction. We identify various types of experiences such applications have evoked by qualitatively analyzing 84 users' narratives of their most satisfying and unsatisfying experiences. The results highlight, for example, experiences of awareness of surroundings, empowerment, positive surprise, amazement and fascination from the novelty value, as well as some examples of immersion and social connectivity. The analysis indicates that the applications have not yet reached their potential in evoking a multifaceted user experience that is characteristic especially to AR. This work helps in understanding the experiential design potential in mobile AR and points out UX issues to further focus on in design.","

"Diversity among enterprise online communities: collaborating, teaming, and innovating through social media","There is a growing body of research into the adoption and use of social software in enterprises. However, less is known about how groups, such as communities, use and appropriate these technologies, and the implications for community structures. In a study of 188 very active online enterprise communities, we found systematic differences in size, demographics and participation, aligned with differences in community types. Different types of communities differed in their appropriation of social software tools to create and use shared resources, and build relationships. We propose implications for design of community support features, services for potential community members, and organizations looking to derive value from online groups.","Social Media can lead to the formation of online communities that are not representative of the broader population, and can reinforce existing social inequalities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208685,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Homeless young people on social network sites,"This paper reports on the use of social network sites (MySpace and Facebook) by homeless young people, an extraordinary user population, made so in part by its vulnerability. Twenty-three participants of diverse ethnicities, 11 women and 12 men (mean age, 21.7 years), were interviewed in same-sex discussion groups of four participants each. The interviews consisted of questions about the uses, benefits, and harms of social network sites and how people present themselves online. Qualitative analysis of the discussion group transcripts shows how young people explore their identities, cultivate and exploit social ties, experience interpersonal tensions, manage incompatible audiences, and respond to shifting affiliations and transitions. From this analysis, implications for social intervention and technical design are presented, focused on maintaining ties with pro-social family and friends and with maintaining separation between communication spheres of incompatible audiences. This work contributes to the growing literature on vital, deeply human experiences that have become associated with social network sites.","Homeless young people using social media may struggle with managing incompatible audiences and maintaining separation between different communication spheres, leading to interpersonal tensions and identity issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208686,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Evaluating compliance-without-pressure techniques for increasing participation in online communities,"Social psychology offers several theories of potential use for designing techniques to increase user contributions to online communities. Some of these techniques follow the ""compliance without pressure"" approach, where users are led to comply with a request without being subjected to any obvious external pressure. We evaluated two such techniques -- foot-in-the-door and low-ball -- in the context of Cyclopath, a geographic wiki. We found that while both techniques succeeded, low-ball elicited more work than foot-in-the-door. We discuss design and research implications of applying these (and other such techniques) in online communities.","Social Media can manipulate users into doing things they don't want to do, without them even realizing it.

Evaluating the benefits of real-time feedback in mobile augmented reality with hand-held devices,"Augmented Reality (AR) has been proved useful to guide operational tasks in professional domains by reducing the shift of attention between instructions and physical objects.

We address these problems by adding real-time feedback to the AR overlay. We conducted a controlled experiment comparing AR with and without feedback, and with standard textual and graphical instructions. Results show significant benefits for mobile AR with feedback and reveals some problems with the other techniques.","

Funneling and saltation effects for tactile interaction with virtual objects,"Funneling and saltation are two major illusory feedback techniques for vibration-based tactile feedback. They are often put into practice e.g. to reduce the number of vibrators to be worn on the body and thereby build a less cumbersome feedback device. Recently, these techniques have been found to be applicable to eliciting ""out of the body"" experiences as well (e.g. through user-held external objects). This paper examines the possibility of applying this phenomenon to interacting with virtual objects. Two usability experiments were run to test the effects of funneling and saltation respectively for perceiving tactile sensation from a virtual object in an augmented reality setting. Experimental results have shown solid evidences for phantom sensations from virtual objects with funneling, but mixed results for saltation.",Reduced physical sensation and potentially harmful out-of-body experiences.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208729,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Perceptions of facebook's value as an information source,"Facebook has become an increasingly important tool for people engaging in a range of communication behaviors, including requesting help from their social network to address information needs. Through a study of 614 staff members at a large university, we show how social capital, network characteristics, and use of Facebook are related to how useful individuals find Facebook to be for informational purposes and their propensity to seek different types of information on the site. We find that bridging social capital and engagement with one's network through directed communication behaviors are important predictors of these dimensions of information seeking; furthermore, a number of demographic and usage behavior differences exist between those who choose to engage in information-seeking behaviors on Facebook and those who do not. Finally, when predicting information-seeking behaviors, we identify a significant interaction between users' perceptions of Facebook as appropriate for purposes beyond the purely social and their engagement with their network.","People may become too reliant on social media for information and help, rather than seeking out diverse sources and engaging in face-to-face communication.

Hands on hitchcock: embodied reference to a moving scene,"In this paper we report on some experiments with a high fidelity media space, t-Room, an immersive system that presents full scale, real-time images of co-participants who are in similar spaces many miles apart. Although being designed to provide a coherent environment for interaction the system introduces a number of incongruities, both in time and space.

Gesture select:: acquiring remote targets on large displays without pointing,"When working at a large wall display, even if partially utilized, many targets are likely to be distant from the user, requiring walking, which is slow, and interrupts workflow. We propose a novel technique for selecting remote targets called Gesture Select, in which users draw an initial mark, in a target's direction; rectilinear gestures represented as icons are dynamically overlaid on targets within a region of interest; the user then continues by drawing the continuation mark corresponding to the target, to select it. Extensions to this technique to support working with remote content for an extended period, and learning gesture shortcuts are presented. A formal experiment indicates Gesture Select significantly outperformed direct selection for mid/far targets. Further analysis suggests Gesture Select performance is principally affected by the extent to which users can read the gestures, influenced by distance and perspective warping, and the gesture complexity in the ROI. The results of a second 2-D experiment with labeled targets indicate Gesture Select significantly outperformed direct selection and an existing technique.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can lead to physical strain and discomfort, particularly when working with remote targets that require walking or other physical movements to access.

Speak little and well: recommending conversations in online social streams,"Conversation is a key element in online social streams such as Twitter and Facebook. However, finding interesting conversations to read is often a challenge, due to information overload and differing user preferences. In this work we explored five algorithms that recommend conversations to Twitter users, utilizing thread length, topic and tie-strength as factors. We compared the algorithms through an online user study and gathered feedback from real Twitter users. In particular, we investigated how users' purposes of using Twitter affect user preferences for different types of conversations and the performance of different algorithms. Compared to a random baseline, all algorithms recommended more interesting conversations. Further, tie-strength based algorithms performed significantly better for people who use Twitter for social purposes than for people who use Twitter for informational purpose only.","Information overload and differing user preferences on social media platforms can make it difficult for users to find interesting and relevant conversations, leading to a negative user experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1978974,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Tweets from Justin Bieber's heart: the dynamics of the location field in user profiles,"Little research exists on one of the most common, oldest, and most utilized forms of online social geographic information: the 'location' field found in most virtual community user profiles. We performed the first in-depth study of user behavior with regard to the location field in Twitter user profiles. We found that 34% of users did not provide real location information, frequently incorporating fake locations or sarcastic comments that can fool traditional geographic information tools. When users did input their location, they almost never specified it at a scale any more detailed than their city. In order to determine whether or not natural user behaviors have a real effect on the 'locatability' of users, we performed a simple machine learning experiment to determine whether we can identify a user's location by only looking at what that user tweets. We found that a user's country and state can in fact be determined easily with decent accuracy, indicating that users implicitly reveal location information, with or without realizing it. Implications for location-based services and privacy are discussed.","Users may unknowingly reveal their location information through their tweets, even if they don't provide real location information in their profiles, which can raise privacy concerns.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1978976,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy

We want more: human-computer collaboration in mobile social video remixing of music concerts,"Recording and publishing mobile video clips from music concerts is popular. There is a high potential to increase the concert's perceived value when producing video remixes from individual video clips and using them socially. A digital production of a video remix is an interactive process between human and computer. However, it is not clear what the collaboration implications between human and computer are. We present a case study where we compare the processes and products of manual and automatic mobile video remixing. We provide results from the first systematic real world study of the subject. We draw our observations from a user trial where fans recorded mobile video clips during a rock concert. The results reveal issues on heterogeneous interests of the stakeholders, unexpected uses of the raw material, the burden of editing, diverse quality requirements, motivations for remixing, the effect of understanding the logic of automation, and the collaborative use of manual and automatic remixing.","

Knowing funny: genre perception and categorization in social video sharing,"Categorization of online videos is often treated as a tag suggestion task; tags can be generated by individuals or by machine classification. In this paper, we suggest categorization can be determined socially, based on people's interactions around media content without recourse to metadata that are intrinsic to the media object itself. This work bridges the gap between the human perception of genre and automatic categorization of genre in classifying online videos. We present findings from two internet surveys and from follow-up interviews where we address how people determine genre classification for videos and how social framing of video content can alter the perception and categorization of that content. From these findings, we train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict genre categories. The trained classifier achieved 82% accuracy using only social action data, without the use of content or media-specific metadata. We conclude with implications on how we categorize and organize media online as well as what our findings mean for designing and building future tools and interaction experiences.","Social media platforms can manipulate users' perceptions and categorizations of online content, such as videos, based on social framing and interactions, rather than the content itself.

Real-time nonverbal opinion sharing through mobile phones during sports events,"Even with the rise of the World Wide Web, TV has remained the most pervasive entertainment medium and is nowadays often used together with other media, which allow for active participation. The idea of connecting non-collocated TV viewers via telecommunication technologies, referred to as Social TV, has recently received considerable attention. Such systems typically include set-top boxes for supporting collaboration. In this research we investigate if real-time opinion sharing about TV shows through a nonverbal (non-textual) iconic UI on mobile phones is reasonable. For this purpose we developed a mobile app, made it available to a large number of users through the Android Market, and conducted an uncontrolled user study in the wild during the soccer world cup 2010. The results of the study indicate that TV viewers who used the app had more fun and felt more connected to other viewers. We also show that by monitoring this channel it is possible to collect sentiments relevant to the broadcasted content in real-time. The collected data exemplify that the aggregated sentiments correspond to important moments, and hence can be used to generate a summary of the event.","Social Media technology can make people feel more connected to others, but it can also make them feel more disconnected from reality.

Are we in sync?: synchronization requirements for watching online video together.,"Synchronization between locations is an important factor for enabling remote shared experiences. Still, experimental data on what is the acceptable synchronization level is scarce. This paper discusses the synchronization requirements for watching online videos together - a popular set of services that recreate the shared experience of watching TV together by offering tools to communicate while watching. It studies the noticeability and annoyance of synchronization differences of the video being watched, as well as the impact on users' feelings of togetherness, both for voice chat and text chat. Results of an experiment with 36 participants show that when using voice chat, users notice synchronization differences sooner, are more annoyed and feel more together than when using text chat.

Fast or safe?: how performance objectives determine modality output choices while interacting on the move,"In-car devices that use audio output have been shown to be less distracting than traditional graphical user interfaces, but can be cumbersome and slow to use. In this paper, we report an experiment that demonstrates how these performance characteristics impact whether people will elect to use an audio interface in a multitasking situation. While steering a simulated vehicle, participants had to locate a source of information in a short passage of text. The text was presented either on a visual interface, or using a text-to-speech audio interface. The relative importance of each task was varied. A no-choice/choice paradigm was used in which participants first gained experience with each of the two interfaces, before being given a choice on which interface to use on later trials. The characteristics of the interaction with the interfaces, as measured in the no-choice phase, and the relative importance of each task, had an impact on which output modality was chosen in the choice phase. Participants that prioritized the secondary task tended to select the (faster yet more distracting) visual interface over the audio interface, and as a result had poorer lane keeping performance. This work demonstrates how a user's task objective will influence modality choices with multimodal devices in multitask environments.","

We develop a model - Coalescence, Focused Interaction, Remixing (CoFIRe) -- of large synchronous interactions, and use it to discuss how the technology supported, or failed to support, the interactions that are the raison d'etre of conferences. We conclude by discussing the prospects for such large virtual gatherings.","

"Life ""modes"" in social media","Current social media products such as Facebook and Twitter have not sufficiently addressed how to help users organize people and content streams across different areas of their lives. We conducted a qualitative design research study to explore how we might best leverage natural models of social organization to improve experiences of social media. We found that participants organize their social worlds based on life 'modes', i.e., family, work and social. They strategically use communication technologies to manage intimacy levels within these modes, and levels of permeability through the boundaries between these modes. Mobile communication in particular enabled participants to aggregate and share content dynamically across life modes. While exploring problems with managing their social media streams, people showed a strong need for focused sharing - the ability to share content only with appropriate audiences within certain areas of life.","Social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, have not effectively helped users manage their online social interactions and content streams, leading to a lack of organization and focused sharing, which can result in inappropriate or excessive sharing of personal information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979022,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Social capital on facebook: differentiating uses and users,"Though social network site use is often treated as a monolithic activity, in which all time is equally social and its impact the same for all users, we examine how Facebook affects social capital depending upon: (1) types of site activities, contrasting one-on-one communication, broadcasts to wider audiences, and passive consumption of social news, and (2) individual differences among users, including social communication skill and self-esteem. Longitudinal surveys matched to server logs from 415 Facebook users reveal that receiving messages from friends is associated with increases in bridging social capital, but that other uses are not. However, using the site to passively consume news assists those with lower social fluency draw value from their connections. The results inform site designers seeking to increase social connectedness and the value of those connections.",Social Media can decrease social connectedness and the value of connections.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979023,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Farmer's tale: a facebook game to promote volunteerism,"Volunteering is an important activity that brings great benefits to societies. However, encouraging volunteerism is difficult due to the altruistic nature of volunteer activities and the high resource demand in carrying them out. We have created a Facebook game called ""Farmer's Tale"" to attract and make it easier for people to volunteer. We evaluated people's acceptance to this novel idea and the results revealed great potential in such type of games.","People may become less inclined to volunteer in real-life situations, as they may feel that their virtual contributions in games like ""Farmer's Tale"" are sufficient.

Identifying social capital in the facebook interface,"A number of studies have identified a robust relationship between the use of social network sites, particularly Facebook, and positive outcomes such as social capital. Social network site use is often measured as a function of use frequency, network size, and a range of subjective opinions about the value of the site. This research extends this understanding by exploring the relationship between the use of particular elements of the site and social capital. Our goal in this research is to identify where, in the interface, perceived social capital is most effectively produced and transmitted. We find that, as hypothesized, public, person-to-person communication is positively associated with perceived social capital. Through the use of a structural equation model, we are able to provide in-depth exploration of the relationship between the interface elements and the outcome, perceived social capital.","Social Media can lead to a false sense of social capital, where users feel connected to others through likes and comments, but in reality, they lack meaningful, in-person connections.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979025,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Using interface cues in online health community boards to change impressions and encourage user contribution,"Online health message boards have become popular, as users not only gain information from other users but also share their own experiences. However, as with most venues of user-generated content, there is need to constantly make quality evaluations as one sifts through enormous amounts of content. Can interface cues, conveying (1) pedigree of users posting content and (2) popularity of the posted content, help new users efficiently make credibility assessments? Furthermore, can the assignment of these same cues to their own posts serve to motivate content generation on their part? These questions were investigated in a 2-session between-subjects experiment (N = 99) with a prototype of a message-board that experimentally varied interface cues, and found that popularity indicators are more influential than pedigree indicators for both evaluation of existing content and contribution of new content. Findings also suggest theoretical mechanisms - involving such concepts as perceived authority, bandwagon effects, sense of agency and sense of community - by which cues affect user experience, providing rich implications for designing and deploying interface cues.","
Social media platforms can be overwhelming and make it difficult for users to evaluate the credibility of the content they consume. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and the amplification of harmful or false ideas. Additionally, the use of interface cues, such as popularity indicators, can motivate users to contribute new content, but may also lead to a focus on quantity over quality, resulting in a decrease in the overall quality of content.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979028,Social Media,CHI,user experience
An actuated physical puppet as an input device for controlling a digital manikin,"We present an actuated handheld puppet system for controlling the posture of a virtual character. Physical puppet devices have been used in the past to intuitively control character posture. In our research, an actuator is added to each joint of such an input device to provide physical feedback to the user. This enhancement offers many benefits. First, the user can upload pre-defined postures to the device to save time. Second, the system is capable of dynamically adjusting joint stiffness to counteract gravity, while allowing control to be maintained with relatively little force. Third, the system supports natural human body behaviors, such as whole-body reaching and joint coupling.

We also conducted two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.","Users may become too reliant on technology and lose touch with reality, leading to decreased physical and social skills.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979034,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Roboshop: multi-layered sketching interface for robot housework assignment and management,"As various home robots come into homes, the need for efficient robot task management tools is arising. Current tools are designed for controlling individual robots independently, so they are not ideally suitable for assigning coordinated action among multiple robots. To address this problem, we developed a management tool for home robots with a graphical editing interface. The user assigns instructions by selecting a tool from a toolbox and sketching on a bird's-eye view of the environment. Layering supports the management of multiple tasks in the same room. Layered graphical representation gives a quick overview of and access to rich information tied to the physical environment. This paper describes the prototype system and reports on our evaluation of the system.","

The development of home robots and management tools for them may lead to a decrease in human interaction and social skills, as people rely more on technology to complete tasks and communicate with others.

Examining the impact of collaborative tagging on sensemaking in nutrition management,"Collaborative tagging mechanisms are integral to social computing applications in a variety of domains. Their expected benefits include simplified retrieval of digital content, as well as enhanced ability of a community to makes sense of the shared content. We examine the impact of collaborative tagging in context of nutrition management. In a controlled experiment we asked individuals to assess the nutritional value of meals based on photographic images and observed the impact of different types of tags and tagging mechanisms on individuals nutritional sensemaking. The results of the study show that tags enhance individuals' ability to remember the viewed meals. However, we found that some types of tags can be detrimental to sensemaking, rather than supporting it. These findings stress the importance of tagging vocabularies and suggest a need for expert moderation of community sensemaking.","

User perceptions of the role and value of tags,"This study investigates user ideas about the role and value of tags in social media. An analysis of 45 interviews with heavy Web users reveals that user perceptions of tags differ from common assumptions held by researchers and designers of social tagging systems. Among beliefs held by participants were that tags were query suggestions or links to other pages, sites, or advertisements - although most identified tags as categories or keywords - and that tags were generated automatically by the computer system. Several participants believed that tags were intended for not only other users but also systems such as search engines. Our findings indicate that Web users, including those who are taggers themselves, experience a high level of uncertainty and confusion about the nature, purpose and value of tags.","Confusion and uncertainty among users about the purpose and value of tags in social media, leading to misconceptions about their role and use.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979039,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Emotion regulation for frustrating driving contexts,"Driving is a challenging task because of the physical, attentional, and emotional demands. When drivers become frustrated by events their negative emotional state can escalate dangerously. This study examines behavioral and attitudinal effects of cognitively reframing frustrating events. Participants (N = 36) were asked to navigate a challenging driving course that included frustrating events such as long lights and being cut-off. Drivers were randomly assigned to three conditions. After encountering a frustrating event, drivers in a reappraisal-down condition heard voice prompts that reappraised the event in an effort to deflate negative reactions. Drivers in the second group, reappraisal-up, heard voice prompts that brought attention to the negative actions of vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers in a silent condition drove without hearing any voice prompts. Participants in the reappraisal-down condition had better driving behavior and reported less negative emotions than participants in the other conditions.",Voice Assistant technology can escalate negative emotions and dangerous behavior while driving.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979050,Voice Assistant,CHI,health & well-being

Is the media equation a flash in the pan?: the durability and longevity of social responses to computers,"Research on social responses to computers often assesses only first-impression reactions during a single experimental session, providing limited knowledge about the lasting effect of the results. In this work, we assess the lasting strength of social desirability bias effects on an interface designed to track exercise, manipulated to have high or low personalization (text vs. anthropomorphic conversational character). After 40 days of daily interactions by 25 participants, we found that self-reported exercise was more accurate when reported to the character vs. text. We also find that, for both conditions, participants' decision to initiate a session is greater when they have done more exercise. Moreover, we show that this effect significantly increases over time for participants in the character condition, and decreases for participants in the text condition. This study demonstrates that Media Equation effects can grow stronger or weaker over time, depending upon the presentation of the interface.","

The study found that people tend to be more honest when reporting their exercise to a character with a human-like personality (anthropomorphic conversational character) compared to a text-based interface. However, this honesty decreases over time for those using the text-based interface, while it increases over time for those using the character interface. This suggests that people may become less truthful in their interactions with Voice Assistants as they become more familiar with them, potentially leading to negative consequences such as over-reliance on technology and decreased personal responsibility.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979055,Voice Assistant,CHI,health & well-being

Social media ownership: using twitter as a window onto current attitudes and beliefs,"Social media, by its very nature, introduces questions about ownership. Ownership comes into play most crucially when we investigate how social media is saved or archived; how it is reused; and whether it can be removed or deleted. We investigate these social media ownership issues using a Mechanical Turk survey of Twitter users; the survey uses open-ended questions and statements of belief about realistic Twitter-based scenarios to give us a window onto current attitudes and beliefs. Our findings reveal that respondents take a liberal attitude toward saving and storing the tweets that they encounter. More caution is exercised with republishing the material, and still more with sharing the material among friends and associates. Respondents approach removal of this type of lightweight social media most cautiously. The material's provenance and the respondents' relationship to the material (whether they are the author or subject) has considerable bearing on what they feel they can do with it.","Social media raises questions about ownership and control of personal data, leading to a lack of caution in saving, storing, and sharing content, and a lack of control over its removal or deletion.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979103,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Fragile online relationship: a first look at unfollow dynamics in twitter,"We analyze the dynamics of the behavior known as 'unfollow' in Twitter. We collected daily snapshots of the online relationships of 1.2 million Korean-speaking users for 51 days as well as all of their tweets. We found that Twitter users frequently unfollow. We then discover the major factors, including the reciprocity of the relationships, the duration of a relationship, the followees' informativeness, and the overlap of the relationships, which affect the decision to unfollow. We conduct interview with 22 Korean respondents to supplement the quantitative results. They unfollowed those who left many tweets within a short time, created tweets about uninteresting topics, or tweeted about the mundane details of their lives.

The impact of network structure on breaking ties in online social networks: unfollowing on twitter,"We investigate the breaking of ties between individuals in the online social network of Twitter, a hugely popular social media service. Building on sociology concepts such as strength of ties, embeddedness, and status, we explore how network structure alone influences tie breaks - the common phenomena of an individual ceasing to ""follow"" another in Twitter's directed social network. We examine these relationships using a dataset of 245,586 Twitter ""follow"" edges, and the persistence of these edges after nine months. We show that structural properties of individuals and dyads at Time 1 have a significant effect on the existence of edges at Time 2, and connect these findings to the social theories that motivated the study.",Social Media can lead to breaking of ties between individuals.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979105,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Computing political preference among twitter followers,"There is great interest in understanding media bias and political information seeking preferences. As many media outlets create online personas, we seek to automatically estimate the political preferences of their audience, rather than of the outlet itself.

Online contribution practices in countries that engage in internet blocking and censorship,"In this article we describe people's online contribution practices in contexts in which the government actively blocks access to or censors the Internet. We argue that people experience blocking as confusing, as a motivation for self-censorship online, as a cause of impoverishment of available content and as a real threat of personal persecution. Challenging ideas of blocking as a monolithic, abstract policy, we discuss five strategies with which Internet users navigate blocking: self-censorship, cultivating technical savvy, reliance on social ties to relay blocked content, use of already blocked sites for content production as a form of protection and practiced transparency. We also discuss strategies that forum owners and blogging platform providers employ to deal with and to avoid blocking.

We accomplish this by analyzing profile images on two social networking sites, Facebook in the US and Renren in China. Our findings indicate that self-presentation is sensitive to national culture: Chinese users are more likely to customize their profile images than Americans.

2d touching of 3d stereoscopic objects,"Recent developments in the area of touch and display technologies have suggested to combine multi-touch systems and stereoscopic visualization. Stereoscopic perception requires each eye to see a slightly different perspective of the same scene, which results in two distinct projections on the display. Thus, if the user wants to select a 3D stereoscopic object in such a setup, the question arises where she would touch the 2D surface to indicate the selection. A user may apply different strategies, for instance touching the midpoint between the two projections, or touching one of them. In this paper we analyze the relation between the 3D positions of stereoscopically rendered objects and the on-surface touch points, where users touch the surface. We performed an experiment in which we determined the positions of the users' touches for objects, which were displayed with positive, negative or zero parallaxes. We found that users tend to touch between the projections for the two eyes with an offset towards the projection for the dominant eye. Our results give implications for the development of future touch-enabled interfaces, which support 3D stereoscopic visualization.","Users may have difficulty accurately selecting 3D objects in stereoscopic displays due to the difference in perspective between the two eyes, leading to confusion and errors.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979142,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Guess who?: enriching the social graph through a crowdsourcing game,"Despite the tremendous popularity of social network sites both on the web and within enterprises, the relationship information they contain may be often incomplete or outdated. We suggest a novel crowdsourcing approach that uses a game to help enrich and expand the social network topology. The game prompts players to provide the names of people who have a relationship with individuals they know. The game was deployed for a one-month period within a large global organization. We provide an analysis of the data collected through this deployment, in comparison with the data from the organization's social network site. Our results indicate that the game rapidly collects large volumes of valid information that can be used to enrich and reinforce an existing social network site's data.

PhotoCity: training experts at large-scale image acquisition through a competitive game,"Large-scale, ground-level urban imagery has recently developed as an important element of online mapping tools such as Google's Street View. Such imagery is extremely valuable in a number of potential applications, ranging from augmented reality to 3D modeling, and from urban planning to monitoring city infrastructure. While such imagery is already available from many sources, including Street View and tourist photos on photo-sharing sites, these collections have drawbacks related to high cost, incompleteness, and accuracy. A potential solution is to leverage the community of photographers around the world to collaboratively acquire large-scale image collections. This work explores this approach through PhotoCity, an online game that trains its players to become ""experts"" at taking photos at targeted locations and in great density, for the purposes of creating 3D building models. To evaluate our approach, we ran a competition between two universities that resulted in the submission of over 100,000 photos, many of which were highly relevant for the 3D modeling task at hand. Although the number of players was small, we found that this was compensated for by incentives that drove players to become experts at photo collection, often capturing thousands of useful photos each.","

The use of online games like PhotoCity to collect large-scale urban imagery can lead to an unequal distribution of contributions, with a small number of players submitting the majority of useful photos. This can result in a biased representation of the urban environment, as certain areas may be overrepresented while others are underrepresented. Additionally, the incentives used to motivate players may not be effective in the long term, leading to a lack of sustained participation and a reliance on a small group of dedicated players.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979146,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice

The impact of social information on visual judgments,"Social visualization systems have emerged to support collective intelligence-driven analysis of a growing influx of open data. As with many other online systems, social signals (e.g., forums, polls) are commonly integrated to drive use. Unfortunately, the same social features that can provide rapid, high-accuracy analysis are coupled with the pitfalls of any social system. Through an experiment involving over 300 subjects, we address how social information signals (social proof) affect quantitative judgments in the context of graphical perception. We identify how unbiased social signals lead to fewer errors over non-social settings and conversely, how biased signals lead to more errors. We further reflect on how systematic bias nullifies certain collective intelligence benefits, and we provide evidence of the formation of information cascades. We describe how these findings can be applied to collaborative visualization systems to produce more accurate individual interpretations in social contexts.","Social Media technology can lead to errors in judgment and decision-making due to the influence of biased social signals, which can create information cascades and nullify the benefits of collective intelligence.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979157,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship

Synchronous remote usability testing: a new approach facilitated by virtual worlds,"This study proposes a new methodology for conducting synchronous remote usability studies using a three-dimensional virtual usability testing laboratory built using the Open Wonderland toolkit. This virtual laboratory method is then compared with two other commonly used synchronous usability test methods: the traditional lab approach and WebEx, a web-based conferencing and screen sharing approach. A study was conducted with 48 participants in total, 36 test participants and 12 test facilitators. The test participants completed 5 tasks on a simulated e-commerce website. The three methodologies were compared with respect to the following dependent variables: the time taken to complete the tasks; the usability defects identified; the severity of these usability defects; and the subjective ratings from NASA-TLX, presence and post-test subjective questionnaires. The three methodologies agreed closely in terms of the total number defects identified, number of high severity defects identified and the time taken to complete the tasks. However, there was a significant difference in the workload experienced by the test participants and facilitators, with the traditional lab condition imposing the least and the virtual lab and the WebEx conditions imposing similar levels. It was also found that the test participants experienced greater involvement and a more immersive experience in the virtual world condition than the WebEx condition. These ratings were not significantly different from those in the traditional lab condition. The results of this study suggest that participants were productive and enjoyed the virtual lab condition, indicating the potential of a virtual world based approach as an alternative to the conventional approaches for synchronous usability testing.","

The study found that participants experienced greater workload and less immersion in the virtual lab condition compared to the traditional lab condition, indicating that virtual reality technology may not always be the best approach for usability testing. Additionally, the study suggests that the virtual world condition may not be suitable for all types of tasks, as participants may experience higher workload and less immersion. This highlights the need for careful consideration when selecting the appropriate methodology for usability testing, as the use of virtual reality technology may not always be the most effective or efficient approach.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979267,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Oops, I did it again: mitigating repeated access control errors on facebook","We performed a study of Facebook users to examine how they coped with limitations of the Facebook privacy settings interface. Students graduating and joining the workforce create significant problems for all but the most basic privacy settings on social networking websites. We therefore created realistic scenarios exploiting work/play boundaries that required users to specify access control policies that were impossible due to various limitations. We examined whether users were aware of these problems without being prompted, and once given feedback, what their coping strategies were. Overall, we found that simply alerting participants to potential errors was ineffective, but when choices were also presented, participants introduced significantly fewer errors. Based on our findings, we designed a privacy settings interface based on Venn diagrams, which we validated with a usability study. We conclude that this interface may be more effective than the current privacy settings interface.","

Evaluating the benefits of 3d stereo in modern video games,"We present a study that investigates user performance benefits of 3D stereo in modern video games. Based on an analysis of several video games that are best suited for use with commercial 3D stereo drivers and vision systems, we chose five modern titles focusing on racing, first and third person shooter, and sports game genres. For each game, quantitative and qualitative measures were taken to determine if users performed better and learned faster in the experimental group (3D stereo display) than in the control group (2D display). A game experience pre-questionnaire was used to classify participants into beginner, intermediate, and advanced gameplay categories to ensure prior game experience did not bias the experiment. Our results indicate that although participants preferred playing in 3D stereo for the games we tested, it does not provide any significant advantage in overall user performance. In addition, users' learning rates were comparable in the 3D stereo display and 2D display cases.",No significant advantage in overall user performance and learning rates despite preference for 3D stereo display.

Location visualization in social media applications,"Location sharing applications are becoming increasingly popular in social media and for use on mobile devices, yet little research has focused on their user interface design. In this paper we describe our method of charting and creating comparable designs, and present a survey-based study of 106 social media users on their preferences regarding location indicators. Our paper contributes in proposing a methodology for visual element evaluation purposes, and reveals results, e.g., that users preferred simple indicators such as points or pins for their own location, and friend location indicators to include the corresponding name.","Location sharing applications can compromise users' privacy and security, as users may unknowingly share their location with strangers or unwanted parties.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979298,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Sampling representative phrase sets for text entry experiments: a procedure and public resource,"Text entry experiments evaluating the effectiveness of various input techniques often employ a procedure whereby users are prompted with natural language phrases which they are instructed to enter as stimuli. For experimental validity, it is desirable to control the stimuli and present text that is representative of a target task, domain or language. MacKenzie and Soukoreff (2001) manually selected a set of 500 phrases for text entry experiments. To demonstrate representativeness, they correlated the distribution of single letters in their phrase set to a relatively small (by current standards) corpus of English prior to 1966, which may not reflect the style of text input today. In this paper, we ground the notion of representativeness in terms of information theory and propose a procedure for sampling representative phrases from any large corpus so that researchers can curate their own stimuli. We then describe the characteristics of phrase sets we generated using the procedure for email and social media (Facebook and Twitter). The phrase sets and code for the procedure are publicly available for download.","Social media platforms may not reflect the style of text input today, and researchers may be using outdated methods to study text entry techniques.

Self-reported password sharing strategies,"This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on privacy and security by looking at self-reported password sharing practices. 62 men and 60 women recruited through a combination of snowball sampling and small ads answered a series of open-ended questions about their password sharing strategies. One third of respondants shared their personal email password, and a quarter shared their Facebook password, both primarily with partners and close friends. Approximately 20% of people who had work email passwords reported sharing them with colleagues. These results support understanding password sharing not as a deviant practice to be stamped out, but rather a nuanced practice engaged in with thought and care.","Sharing of personal passwords, especially among close friends and partners, can lead to unauthorized access and potential security breaches.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979324,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Enticing consumers via incomplete product experience: an investigation of online product interactivity designs,"This paper reports on two studies that investigate the design of online product interactivity. The first study compares three different presentation formats: a video presentation and two Virtual Product Experience (VPE) presentations, namely, triggered interaction and full interaction. The findings suggest that triggered interaction VPE is more effective in enticing users to attend to and further explore the featured products than both the non-interactive video presentation and the full interaction VPE. The second study builds upon the first and focuses on two specific VPE design factors. In particular, it investigates interaction constraint (high versus low constraint) in addition to the activation mode of interaction (process-based interaction versus event-based interaction). The results reveal interesting interaction patterns between the two design factors, i.e., providing less constrained interaction performs better when process-based interaction design is adopted, but performs worse when event-based interaction is employed.","Over-reliance on virtual experiences, leading to decreased attention to real-world surroundings and potential negative impacts on mental and physical health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979335,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Perceptual analysis of talking avatar head movements: a quantitative perspective,"Lifelike interface agents (e.g. talking avatars) have been increasingly used in human-computer interaction applications. In this work, we quantitatively analyze how human perception is affected by audio-head motion characteristics of talking avatars. Specifically, we quantify the correlation between perceptual user ratings (obtained via user study) and joint audio-head motion features as well as head motion patterns in the frequency-domain. Our quantitative analysis results clearly show that the correlation coefficient between the pitch of speech signals (but not the RMS energy of speech signals) and head motions is approximately linearly proportional to the perceptual user rating, and a larger proportion of high frequency signals in talking avatar head movements tends to degrade the user perception in terms of naturalness.",Talking avatars in AR/VR can negatively impact user perception of naturalness if their head movements and speech pitch are not synchronized.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979337,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Multi-user interaction on media facades through live video on mobile devices,"The increasing number of media facades in urban spaces offers great potential for new forms of interaction especially for collaborative multi-user scenarios. In this paper, we present a way to directly interact with them through live video on mobile devices. We extend the Touch Projector interface to accommodate multiple users by showing individual content on the mobile display that would otherwise clutter the facade's canvas or distract other users. To demonstrate our concept, we built two collaborative multi-user applications: (1) painting on the facade and (2) solving a 15-puzzle.

Interaction with magic lenses: real-world validation of a Fitts' Law model,"Rohs and Oulasvirta (2008) proposed a two-component Fitts' law model for target acquisition with magic lenses in mobile augmented reality (AR) with 1) a physical pointing phase, in which the target can be directly observed on the background surface, and 2) a virtual pointing phase, in which the target can only be observed through the device display. The model provides a good fit (R2=0.88) with laboratory data, but it is not known if it generalizes to real-world AR tasks. In the present outdoor study, subjects (N=12) did building-selection tasks in an urban area. The differences in task characteristics to the laboratory study are drastic: targets are three-dimensional and they vary in shape, size, z-distance, and visual context. Nevertheless, the model yielded an R2 of 0.80, and when using effective target width an R2 of 0.88 was achieved.","

TapBack: towards richer mobile interfaces in impoverished contexts,"Much of the mobile work by HCI researchers explores a future world populated by high-end devices and relatively affluent users. This paper turns to consider the hundreds of millions of people for whom such sophistication will not be realised for many years to come. In developing world contexts, people will continue to rely on voice-primary interactions due to both literacy and economic reasons. Here, we motivate research into how to accommodate advanced mobile interface techniques while overcoming the handset, data-connection and user limitations. As a first step we introduce TapBack: back-of-device taps to control a dialled-up, telephone-network-based voice service. We show how these audio gestures might be recognised over a standard telephone connection, via users' existing low-end devices. Further, in a longitudinal deployment, the techniques were made available on a live voice service used by rural Indian farmers. Data from the study illustrates the desire by users to adopt the approach and its potential extensions.","

Sasayaki: augmented voice web browsing experience,"Auditory user interfaces have great Web-access potential for billions of people with visual impairments, with limited literacy, who are driving, or who are otherwise unable to use a visual interface. However a sequential speech-based representation can only convey a limited amount of information. In addition, typical auditory user interfaces lose the visual cues such as text styles and page structures, and lack effective feedback about the current focus. To address these limitations, we created Sasayaki (from whisper in Japanese), which augments the primary voice output with a secondary whisper of contextually relevant information, automatically or in response to user requests. It also offers new ways to jump to semantically meaningful locations. A prototype was implemented as a plug-in for an auditory Web browser. Our experimental results show that the Sasayaki can reduce the task completion times for finding elements in webpages and increase satisfaction and confidence.","Voice Assistant technology can only convey a limited amount of information through sequential speech-based representation, which can result in inefficiency and user frustration.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979353,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
On the audio representation of radial direction,"We present and evaluate an approach towards eyes-free auditory display of spatial information that considers radial direction as a fundamental type of value primitive. There are many benefits to being able to sonify radial directions, such as indicating the heading towards a point of interest in a direct and dynamic manner, rendering a path or shape outline by sonifying a continual sequence of tangent directions as the path is traced, and providing direct feedback of the direction of motion of the user in a physical space or a pointer in a virtual space. We propose a concrete mapping of vowel-like sounds to radial directions as one potential method to enable sonification of such information. We conducted a longitudinal study with five sighted and two blind participants to evaluate the learnability and effectiveness of this method. Results suggest that our directional sound mapping can be learned within a few hours and be used to aurally perceive spatial information such as shape outlines and path contours.","

The over-reliance on virtual/augmented reality technology can lead to a decrease in the ability to perceive and understand spatial information in the real world, as people become more accustomed to relying on technology to provide them with auditory or visual cues rather than using their own senses. This could result in a loss of situational awareness and ability to navigate physical spaces independently.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979354,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Spatialized sound enhances biomechanically-induced self-motion illusion (vection),"The use of vection, the illusion of self-movement, has recently been explored as a novel way to immerse observers in mediated environments through illusory yet compelling self-motion without physically moving. This provides advantages over existing systems that employ costly, cumbersome, and potentially hazardous motion platforms, which are often surprisingly inadequate to provide life-like motion experiences. This study investigates whether spatialized sound rotating around the stationary, blindfolded listener can facilitate biomechanical vection, the illusion of self-rotation induced by stepping along a rotating floor plate. For the first time, integrating simple auditory and biomechanical cues for turning in place evoked convincing circular vection. In an auditory baseline condition, participants experienced only spatialized auditory cues. In a purely biomechanical condition, seated participants stepped along sideways on a rotating plate while listening to mono masking sounds. Scores of the bi-modal condition (binaural+biomechanical cues) exceeded the sum of both single cue conditions, which may imply super-additive or synergistic effects.","

Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can create illusions that are so convincing that they can disrupt our perception of reality. For example, the use of vection, which creates the illusion of self-movement, can be so realistic that it can make it difficult for people to distinguish between what is real and what is not. This can lead to confusion, disorientation, and even physical harm if people are not careful. Additionally, the use of auditory and biomechanical cues to create the illusion of movement can be so effective that it can make people feel like they are moving when they are actually stationary, which can cause motion sickness or other adverse effects.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979356,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Redesign as an act of violence: disrupted interaction patterns and the fragmenting of a social Q&A community,"The worst-case scenario for the redesign of an established online community is a subsequent mass migration of its core members to other sites. Using data from transaction logs, content analysis and participant observation, this paper presents a descriptive analysis of the fragmentation of a social question answering (Q&A) community in the immediate aftermath of a fundamental redesign, where site-based communication mechanisms no longer functioned. The ways in which the community and its diaspora reacted, reconnected and resettled on other sites provides empirical data to support recent research on the life cycle of online communities. The results suggest that many of the same processes that help social Q&A sites generate content and motivate participation can work to dismantle an established community if communications between members are even temporarily disrupted. Modeling a redesign as an attack on a community can help future designers anticipate alternative paths of communication and information flows.","Social Media redesign can disrupt communication and cause mass migration of core members to other sites, leading to community fragmentation and loss of valuable content and participation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979365,Social Media,CHI,user experience

Raconteur: integrating authored and real-time social media,"Social media enables people to share personal experiences, often through real-time media such as chat. People also record their life experiences in media collections, with photos and video. However, today's social media force a choice between real-time communication, and authoring a coherent story illustrated with digital media. There is simply not enough time in real-time communication to select and compose coherent multimedia stories. We present Raconteur, which introduces a new style of social media combining aspects of the real-time and authored styles of communication. It is structured around a text chat, augmented by an agent that continuously interprets the chat text to suggest appropriate media elements to illustrate the story. A small experiment shows that storytellers find Raconteur's suggestions helpful in presenting their experiences, and audiences find the interaction engaging.","Social media platforms are forcing users to choose between real-time communication and curating a coherent story, leading to a lack of well-crafted, meaningful content.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979411,Social Media,CHI,user experience
We're in it together: interpersonal management of disclosure in social network services,"The workload needed for managing privacy and publicness in current social network services (SNSs) is placed on individuals, yet people have few means to control what others disclose about them. This paper considers SNS-users' concerns in relation to online disclosure and the ways in which they cope with these both individually and collaboratively. While previous work has focused mainly on individual coping strategies, our findings from a qualitative study with 27 participants suggest that collaborative strategies in boundary regulation are of additional importance. We present a framework of strategies for boundary regulation that informs both theoretical work and design practice related to management of disclosure in SNSs. The framework considers disclosure as an interpersonal process of boundary regulation, in which people are dependent on what others choose to disclose about them. The paper concludes by proposing design solutions supportive of collaborative and preventive strategies in boundary regulation that facilitate the management of disclosure online.","Individuals have limited control over what others disclose about them on social media, leading to concerns about privacy and publicness.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979420,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Distinguishing multiple smart-phone interactions on a multi-touch wall display using tilt correlation,"While very large collaborative surfaces are already being widely employed to facilitate concurrent interactions with multiple users, they involve no personalization in the touch interactions. Augmenting them to identify the touch interactions with multiple smart-phones can enable interesting co-located communal applications with context-based personalized interactions and information exchange amongst users' portable devices and the shared wall display. This paper proposes a novel matching technique, called tilt correlation, which employs the built-in tilt sensor to identify smart-phones that make concurrent two-point contacts on a common multi-touch wall display. Experimental investigations suggest that the resultant error rate is relatively low; in addition, we also propose a quantitative measure, called the Bourne Identity Index to allow application designers to determine the reliability of each device identification.","Lack of personalization in touch interactions on collaborative surfaces can be addressed by identifying touch interactions with multiple smartphones, but this raises privacy concerns as it involves tracking and exchanging personal information amongst users' devices and the shared display.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979433,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Normative influences on thoughtful online participation,"We describe two experiments on whether individual thoughtful effort during online commenting is shaped by situational norms derived from the behavior of social others and the design of the environment, respectively. By measuring the length of participants' comments on a news website, the time taken to write them, and the number of issue-relevant thoughts they contain, we demonstrate that participants conform to high vs. low norms of thoughtfulness manifested through either the apparent behavior of other users or through visual, textual and interactional design features conceptually associated with thoughtfulness. Theoretical and applied insights for designing online participatory environments are discussed.","Social media platforms can influence users to conform to low standards of thoughtfulness and effort in their online interactions, rather than encouraging meaningful and well-thought-out contributions.

Computers can't give credit: how automatic attribution falls short in an online remixing community,"In this paper, we explore the role that attribution plays in shaping user reactions to content reuse, or remixing, in a large user-generated content community. We present two studies using data from the Scratch online community - a social media platform where hundreds of thousands of young people share and remix animations and video games. First, we present a quantitative analysis that examines the effects of a technological design intervention introducing automated attribution of remixes on users' reactions to being remixed. We compare this analysis to a parallel examination of ""manual"" credit-giving. Second, we present a qualitative analysis of twelve in-depth, semi-structured, interviews with Scratch participants on the subject of remixing and attribution. Results from both studies suggest that automatic attribution done by technological systems (i.e., the listing of names of contributors) plays a role that is distinct from, and less valuable than, credit which may superficially involve identical information but takes on new meaning when it is given by a human remixer. We discuss the implications of these findings for the designers of online communities and social media platforms.","Social Media platforms' automated attribution systems can devalue the meaning and impact of credit given by human remixers, potentially discouraging users from creating and sharing content.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1979452,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Space to think: large high-resolution displays for sensemaking,"Space supports human cognitive abilities in a myriad of ways. The note attached to the side of the monitor, the papers spread out on the desk, diagrams scrawled on a whiteboard, and even the keys left out on the counter are all examples of using space to recall, reveal relationships, and think.

Student socialization in the age of facebook,"Most research regarding online social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, Linked-In and Friendster has looked at these networks in terms of activity within the online network, such as profile management and friending behavior. In this paper we are instead focusing on offline socializing structures around an online social network (exemplified by Facebook) and how this can facilitate in-person social life for students. Because students lead nomadic lives, they find Facebook a particularly useful tool for initiating and managing social gatherings, and as they adopt mobile technologies that can access online social networks, their ad-hoc social life is further enabled. We conclude that online social networks are a powerful tool for encouraging peripheral friendships, important in particular to students. We emphasize that the use of online social networks must be viewed from a perspective of use that involves both mobile and stationary platforms and that it is important to relate online and offline social practices.","Social Media can make people more focused on online connections and neglect face-to-face interactions, leading to a decline in meaningful, in-person relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753347,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Catalyzing social support for breast cancer patients,"Social support is a critical, yet underutilized resource when undergoing cancer care. Underutilization occurs in two conditions: (a) when patients fail to seek out information, material assistance, and emotional support from family and friends or (b) when family and friends fail to meet the individualized needs and preferences of patients. Social networks are most effective when kept up to date on the patient's status, yet updating everyone takes effort that patients cannot always put in. To improve this situation, we describe the results of our participatory design activities with breast cancer patients. During this process, we uncovered the information a social network needs to stay informed as well as a host of barriers to social support that technology could help break down.

Why users of yahoo!: answers do not answer questions,"Posing a question to an online question and answer community does not guarantee a response. Significant prior work has explored and identified members' motivations for contributing to communities of collective action (e.g., Yahoo! Answers); in contrast it is not well understood why members choose to not answer a question they have already read. To explore this issue, we surveyed 135 active members of Yahoo! Answers. We show that top and regular contributors experience the same reasons to not answer a question: subject nature and composition of the question; perception of how the questioner will receive, interpret and react to their response; and a belief that their response will lose its meaning and get lost in the crowd if too many responses have already been given. Informed by our results, we discuss opportunities to improve the efficacy of the question and answer process, and to encourage greater contributions through improved design.","People may not answer questions on online Q&A platforms due to various reasons such as the nature of the question, fear of how their response will be received, and belief that their response will get lost in the crowd.

Exploiting knowledge-in-the-head and knowledge-in-the-social-web: effects of domain expertise on exploratory search in individual and social search environments,"Our study compared how experts and novices performed exploratory search using a traditional search engine and a social tagging system. As expected, results showed that social tagging systems could facilitate exploratory search for both experts and novices. We, however, also found that experts were better at interpreting the social tags and generating search keywords, which made them better at finding information in both interfaces. Specifically, experts found more general information than novices by better interpretation of social tags in the tagging system; and experts also found more domain-specific information by generating more of their own keywords. We found a dynamic interaction between knowledge-in-the-head and knowledge-in-the-social-web that although information seekers are more and more reliant on information from the social Web, domain expertise is still important in guiding them to find and evaluate the information. Implications on the design of social search systems that facilitate exploratory search are also discussed.","Social Media technology can make people less effective at finding and evaluating information, as they become too reliant on information from the social web and neglect their own domain expertise.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753386,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Speech dasher: fast writing using speech and gaze,"Speech Dasher allows writing using a combination of speech and a zooming interface. Users first speak what they want to write and then they navigate through the space of recognition hypotheses to correct any errors. Speech Dasher's model combines information from a speech recognizer, from the user, and from a letter-based language model. This allows fast writing of anything predicted by the recognizer while also providing seamless fallback to letter-by-letter spelling for words not in the recognizer's predictions. In a formative user study, expert users wrote at 40 (corrected) words per minute. They did this despite a recognition word error rate of 22%. Furthermore, they did this using only speech and the direction of their gaze (obtained via an eye tracker).","

The technology can lead to a decrease in literacy skills as users rely more on speech recognition and less on manual typing, which can result in a loss of ability to spell words correctly.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753415,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Weightless walls and the future office,"In this paper we describe how future office environments can benefit from the addition of weightless walls virtual, sound blocking walls created using headsets. We particularly focus on exploring how different interaction techniques can be employed to efficiently create, erase, or edit the layouts of these walls, and envisioning how they could impact the overall office experience. Metaphorically, the end effect of integrating weightless walls into offices is that space will be treated in a way similar to how random access memory is treated in PCs; as a shared resource open to dynamic allocations, and whose usage is periodically optimized in real time according to the collective activities of the occupants. Furthermore, we view weightless walls as harbingers of the emergence of synthetic space the eventual fusion of the architectural environment with the distinctive properties of digital bits.","

The integration of weightless walls in offices could lead to a lack of privacy and personal space for employees, as the virtual walls can be easily created, erased, or edited, and the office space can be constantly optimized for maximum efficiency. This could result in employees feeling like they are constantly being monitored and their personal boundaries being disregarded. Additionally, the fusion of the architectural environment with digital bits could lead to a loss of human connection and personal interaction, as people become more reliant on technology and less engaged with their physical surroundings and the people around them.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753419,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy

Avaaj Otalo: a field study of an interactive voice forum for small farmers in rural India,"In this paper we present the results of a field study of Avaaj Otalo (literally, ""voice stoop""), an interactive voice application for small-scale farmers in Gujarat, India. Through usage data and interviews, we describe how 51 farmers used the system over a seven month pilot deployment. The most popular feature of Avaaj Otalo was a forum for asking questions and browsing others' questions and responses on a range of agricultural topics. The forum developed into a lively social space with the emergence of norms, persistent moderation, and a desire for both structured interaction with institutionally sanctioned authorities and open discussion with peers. For all 51 users this was the first experience participating in an online community of any sort. In terms of usability, simple menu-based navigation was readily learned, with users preferring numeric input over speech. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for designing voice-based social media serving rural communities in India and elsewhere.","
The article highlights the potential for voice assistant technology to create social spaces that may not align with the norms and values of the broader society, and may even perpetuate harmful or exclusionary practices. The forum created by Avaaj Otalo, for example, developed its own norms and moderation practices that may not be desirable or inclusive for all users. This raises concerns about the impact of such technology on society, particularly in rural communities that may be more vulnerable to the negative consequences of online social spaces.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753434,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
LayerPaint: a multi-layer interactive 3D painting interface,"Painting on 3D surfaces is an important operation in computer graphics, virtual reality, and computer aided design. The painting styles in existing WYSIWYG systems can be awkward, due to the difficulty in rotating or aligning an object for proper viewing during the painting. This paper proposes a multi-layer approach to building a practical, robust, and novel WYSIWYG interface for efficient painting on 3D models. The paintable area is not limited to the front-most visible surface on the screen as in conventional WYSIWYG interfaces. We can efficiently and interactively draw long strokes across different depth layers, and unveil occluded regions that one would like to see or paint on. In addition, since the painting is now depth-sensitive, we can avoid various potential painting artifacts and limitations in the conventional painting interfaces. This multi-layer approach brings in several novel painting operations that contribute to a more compelling WYSIWYG 3D painting interface; this is particular useful when dealing with complicated objects with occluded parts and objects that cannot be easily parameterized. We evaluated our system with 23 users, including both artists and novice painters, and obtained positive experimental results and feedback from them. The user study results demonstrate the efficacy of our novel interface over conventional painting interfaces.","

The proposed technology could lead to a decrease in the quality of art produced, as artists may become too reliant on the technology and neglect traditional painting techniques. Additionally, the technology may create a barrier between the artist and their work, making it more difficult for them to connect with their creations on a personal level.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753445,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Exploring the workplace communication ecology,"The modern workplace is inherently collaborative, and this collaboration relies on effective communication among co-workers. Many communication tools -- email, blogs, wikis, Twitter, etc. -- have become increasingly available and accepted in workplace communications.

We found that participants used a large number of communication tools for different purposes, and that the introduction of new tools did not impact significantly the use of previously-adopted technologies. Further, we identified distinct classes of users based on patterns of tool use. This work has implications for the design of technology in the evolving ecology of communication tools.","

Effects of interactivity and 3D-motion on mental rotation brain activity in an immersive virtual environment,"The combination of virtual reality (VR) and brain measurements is a promising development of HCI, but the maturation of this paradigm requires more knowledge about how brain activity is influenced by parameters of VR applications. To this end we investigate the influence of two prominent VR parameters, 3d-motion and interactivity, while brain activity is measured for a mental rotation task, using functional MRI (fMRI). A mental rotation network of brain areas is identified, matching previous results. The addition of interactivity increases the activation in core areas of this network, with more profound effects in frontal and preparatory motor areas. The increases from 3d-motion are restricted to primarily visual areas. We relate these effects to emerging theories of cognition and potential applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our results demonstrate one way to provoke increased activity in task-relevant areas, making it easier to detect and use for adaptation and development of HCI.","Over-reliance on technology, decreased cognitive abilities, and potential for addiction.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753454,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being

Cultural difference in image tagging,"Do people from different cultures tag digital images differently? The current study compared the content of tags for digital images created by two cultural groups: European Americans and Chinese. In line with previous findings on cultural differences in attentional patterns, we found similar cultural differences in the order of the image parts (e.g., foreground or background objects) that people tag. We found that for European Americans, the first tag was more likely assigned to the main objects than that by Chinese; but for Chinese, the first tag was more likely assigned to the overall description or relations between objects in the images. The findings had significant implications for designing cultural-sensitive tools to facilitate the tagging and search process of digital media, as well as for developing data-mining tools that identify user profiles based on their tagging patterns and cultural origins.","Cultural differences in digital image tagging can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, and may result in inadequate representation of certain cultures in digital media.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753472,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Social tagging revamped: supporting the users' need of self-promotion through persuasive techniques,"People share pictures online to increase their social presence. However, recent studies have shown that most of the content shared in social networks is not looked at by peers. Proper metadata can be generated and used to improve the retrieval of this content. In spite of this, we still lack solutions for collecting valid descriptors of content that can be used effectively in the context of social information navigation. In this paper, we propose a mechanism based on persuasive techniques to support peers in providing metadata for multimedia content that can be used for a person's self-promotion. Through an iterative design and experimentation process, we demonstrate how this methodology can be used effectively to increase one's social presence thus building more enjoyable, rich, and creative content that is shared in the social network. In addition, we highlight implications that inform the design of social games with a purpose.","People are using social media to self-promote and increase their social presence, but most of the content they share is not being looked at by their peers.

Where are you pointing?: the accuracy of deictic pointing in CVEs,"Deictic reference -- pointing at things during conversation -- is ubiquitous in human communication, and should also be an important tool in distributed collaborative virtual environments (CVEs). Pointing gestures can be complex and subtle, however, and pointing is much more difficult in the virtual world. In order to improve the richness of interaction in CVEs, it is important to provide better support for pointing and deictic reference, and a first step in this support is to determine how well people can interpret the direction that another person is pointing. To investigate this question, we carried out two studies. The first identified several ways that people point towards distant targets, and established that not all pointing requires high accuracy. This suggested that natural CVE pointing could potentially be successful; but no knowledge is available about whether even moderate accuracy is possible in CVEs. Therefore, our second study looked more closely at how accurately people can produce and interpret the direction of pointing gestures in CVEs. We found that although people are more accurate in the real world, the differences are smaller than expected; our results show that deixis can be successful in CVEs for many pointing situations, and provide a foundation for more comprehensive support of deictic pointing.","

"Lie tracking: social presence, truth and deception in avatar-mediated telecommunication","The success of visual telecommunication systems depends on their ability to transmit and display users' natural nonverbal behavior. While video-mediated communication (VMC) is the most widely used form of interpersonal remote interaction, avatar-mediated communication (AMC) in shared virtual environments is increasingly common. This paper presents two experiments investigating eye tracking in AMC. The first experiment compares the degree of social presence experienced in AMC and VMC during truthful and deceptive discourse. Eye tracking data (gaze, blinking, and pupil size) demonstrates that oculesic behavior is similar in both mediation types, and uncovers systematic differences between truth telling and lying. Subjective measures show users' psychological arousal to be greater in VMC than AMC. The second experiment demonstrates that observers of AMC can more accurately detect truth and deception when viewing avatars with added oculesic behavior driven by eye tracking. We discuss implications for the design of future visual telecommunication media interfaces.","

Blogging in a region of conflict: supporting transition to recovery,"The blogosphere is changing how people experience war and conflict. We conducted an analysis of 125 blogs written by Iraqi citizens experiencing extreme disruption in their country. We used Hoffman's [8] stages of recovery model to understand how blogs support people in a region where conflict is occurring. We found that blogs create a safe virtual environment where people could interact, free of the violence in the physical environment and of the strict social norms of their changing society in wartime. Second, blogs enable a large network of global support through their interactive and personal nature. Third, blogs enable people experiencing a conflict to engage in dialogue with people outside their borders to discuss their situation. We discuss how blogs enable people to collaboratively interpret conflict through communities of interest and discussion with those who comment.

Microblogging during two natural hazards events: what twitter may contribute to situational awareness,"We analyze microblog posts generated during two recent, concurrent emergency events in North America via Twitter, a popular microblogging service. We focus on communications broadcast by people who were ""on the ground"" during the Oklahoma Grassfires of April 2009 and the Red River Floods that occurred in March and April 2009, and identify information that may contribute to enhancing situational awareness (SA). This work aims to inform next steps for extracting useful, relevant information during emergencies using information extraction (IE) techniques.","

The article highlights the potential for misinformation to spread during emergency situations through social media platforms like Twitter. False information can be broadcast by people who are not directly affected by the event, leading to confusion and panic among those who are. This can hinder efforts to respond to the emergency and put people's lives at risk. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods to extract accurate and relevant information from social media during emergencies to enhance situational awareness and prevent the spread of misinformation.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753486,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Short and tweet: experiments on recommending content from information streams,"More and more web users keep up with newest information through information streams such as the popular micro-blogging website Twitter. In this paper we studied content recommendation on Twitter to better direct user attention. In a modular approach, we explored three separate dimensions in designing such a recommender: content sources, topic interest models for users, and social voting. We implemented 12 recommendation engines in the design space we formulated, and deployed them to a recommender service on the web to gather feedback from real Twitter users. The best performing algorithm improved the percentage of interesting content to 72% from a baseline of 33%. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of our recommender design and how our design can generalize to other information streams.","

The algorithm used in the study to improve the percentage of interesting content on Twitter from 33% to 72% can be used to manipulate users' attention and direct them towards certain information that may not be in their best interest. This can lead to a filter bubble where users are only exposed to information that confirms their existing beliefs, rather than being exposed to diverse perspectives.

Characterizing debate performance via aggregated twitter sentiment,"Television broadcasters are beginning to combine social micro-blogging systems such as Twitter with television to create social video experiences around events. We looked at one such event, the first U.S. presidential debate in 2008, in conjunction with aggregated ratings of message sentiment from Twitter. We begin to develop an analytical methodology and visual representations that could help a journalist or public affairs person better understand the temporal dynamics of sentiment in reaction to the debate video. We demonstrate visuals and metrics that can be used to detect sentiment pulse, anomalies in that pulse, and indications of controversial topics that can be used to inform the design of visual analytic systems for social media events.","Social media can be used to manipulate public opinion during live events, such as presidential debates, by creating a false narrative of public sentiment through the use of bots and fake accounts.

Don't just stare at me!,"Communication is more effective and persuasive when participants establish rapport. Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal [57] argue rapport arises when participants exhibit mutual attentiveness, positivity and coordination. In this paper, we investigate how these factors relate to perceptions of rapport when users interact via avatars in virtual worlds. In this study, participants told a story to what they believed was the avatar of another participant. In fact, the avatar was a computer program that systematically manipulated levels of attentiveness, positivity and coordination. In contrast to Tickel-Degnen and Rosenthal's findings, high-levels of mutual attentiveness alone can dramatically lower perceptions of rapport in avatar communication. Indeed, an agent that attempted to maximize mutual attention performed as poorly as an agent that was designed to convey boredom. Adding positivity and coordination to mutual attentiveness, on the other hand, greatly improved rapport. This work unveils the dependencies between components of rapport and informs the design of agents and avatars in computer mediated communication.","

Integrating Text with Video and 3D Graphics: The Effects of Text Drawing Styles on Text Readability,"There have been many studies of computer based text reading. However, only a few have considered text integrated with video and 3D graphics. This paper presents an investigation into the effects of varying (a) text drawing style (plain, billboard, Anti-Interference, shadow), (b) image polarity (positive and negative), and (c) background style (video and 3D) on text readability. Reading speed and accuracy were measured and subjective views of participants recorded. Results showed that: (a) there was little difference in reading performance for the video and 3D backgrounds; (b) the negative presentation outperformed the positive presentation; (c) the billboard drawing styles supported the best performance; subjective comments showed a preference for the billboard style. We therefore suggest, for reading tasks, that designers of interfaces for games, video, and augmented reality provide billboard style to maximize readability for the widest range of applications.","

The study found that the billboard style, which is commonly used in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) interfaces, can actually decrease reading performance and accuracy compared to other styles. This suggests that the use of AR/VR technology in reading tasks may not always be beneficial and could potentially hinder comprehension. Additionally, the preference for the billboard style among participants may indicate a trade-off between readability and aesthetics, which could have negative consequences for tasks that require accurate reading.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753524,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Signed networks in social media,"Relations between users on social media sites often reflect a mixture of positive (friendly) and negative (antagonistic) interactions. In contrast to the bulk of research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive interpretations of links between people, we study how the interplay between positive and negative relationships affects the structure of on-line social networks. We connect our analyses to theories of signed networks from social psychology. We find that the classical theory of structural balance tends to capture certain common patterns of interaction, but that it is also at odds with some of the fundamental phenomena we observe --- particularly related to the evolving, directed nature of these on-line networks. We then develop an alternate theory of status that better explains the observed edge signs and provides insights into the underlying social mechanisms. Our work provides one of the first large-scale evaluations of theories of signed networks using on-line datasets, as well as providing a perspective for reasoning about social media sites.","Social Media can create a false sense of connection and community, leading to negative interactions and a lack of meaningful relationships.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753532,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
pCubee: a perspective-corrected handheld cubic display,"In this paper, we describe the design of a personal cubic display that offers novel interaction techniques for static and dynamic 3D content. We extended one-screen Fish Tank VR by arranging five small LCD panels into a box shape that is light and compact enough to be handheld. The display uses head-coupled perspective rendering and a real-time physics simulation engine to establish an interaction metaphor of having real objects inside a physical box that a user can hold and manipulate. We evaluated our prototype as a visualization tool and as an input device by comparing it with a conventional LCD display and mouse for a 3D tree-tracing task. We found that bimanual interaction with pCubee and a mouse offered the best performance and was most preferred by users. pCubee has potential in 3D visualization and interactive applications such as games, storytelling and education, as well as viewing 3D maps, medical and architectural data.","

The use of personal cubic displays for extended periods of time can lead to eye strain and fatigue due to the close proximity of the screens and the need to focus on 3D content.

America is like Metamucil: fostering critical and creative thinking about metaphor in political blogs,"Blogs are becoming an increasingly important medium -- socially, academically, and politically. Much research has involved analyzing blogs, but less work has considered how such analytic techniques might be incorporated into tools for blog readers. A new tool, metaViz, analyzes political blogs for potential conceptual metaphors and presents them to blog readers. This paper presents a study exploring the types of critical and creative thinking fostered by metaViz as evidenced by user comments and discussion on the system. These results indicate the effectiveness of various system features at fostering critical thinking and creativity, specifically in terms of deep, structural reasoning about metaphors and creatively extending existing metaphors. Furthermore, the results carry broader implications beyond blogs and politics about exploring alternate configurations between computation and human thought.","

Propitious aggregation: reducing participant burden in ego-centric network data collection,"One of the central challenges of ego-centric or personal social network research is minimizing the quantity of data that is requested from research participants while ensuring high data accuracy and validity. In general, collecting data about increasingly larger ego-centric networks places an increasing burden on respondents. The web-based Propitious Aggregation of Social Networks (PASN, http://pro.pitio.us) survey instrument reduces this burden by leveraging network data already available in the context of social network websites, and by providing an intuitive click-and-drag interface for survey responses. An experiment was conducted (N = 85), and the PASN method was found to produce networks which were significantly larger and more diverse than those produced using standard survey methods, yet required significantly lower time investments from participants.","Social Media technology can lead to an increasing burden on users to provide personal data, which can be time-consuming and potentially invasive.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753545,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
"Social gravity: a virtual elastic tether for casual, privacy-preserving pedestrian rendezvous","We describe a virtual ""tether"" for mobile devices that allows groups to have quick, simple and privacy-preserving meetups. Our design provides cues which allow dynamic coordination of rendezvous without revealing users' positions. Using accelerometers and magnetometers, combined with GPS positioning and non-visual feedback, users can probe and sense a dynamic virtual object representing the nearest meeting point. The Social Gravity system makes social bonds tangible in a virtual world which is geographically grounded, using haptic feedback to help users rendezvous. We show dynamic navigation using this physical model-based system to be efficient and robust in significant field trials, even in the presence of low-quality positioning. The use of simulators to build models of mobile geolocated systems for pre-validation purposes is discussed, and results compared with those from our trials. Our results show interesting behaviours in the social coordination task, which lead to guidelines for geosocial interaction design. The Social Gravity system proved to be very successful in allowing groups to rendezvous efficiently and simply and can be implemented using only commercially available hardware.","

The Social Gravity system, which uses virtual ""tethers"" to help groups coordinate meetups, could potentially lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and social skills, as people rely more on technology and less on personal communication and coordination.

Friends only: examining a privacy-enhancing behavior in facebook,"Privacy practices in social network sites often appear paradoxical, as content-sharing behavior stands in conflict with the need to reduce disclosure-related harms. In this study we explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation. Drawing on a sample survey of undergraduate Facebook users, we examine a particular privacy-enhancing practice: having a friends-only Facebook profile. Particularly, we look at the association between network composition, expectancy violations, interpersonal privacy practices and having a friends-only profile. We find that expectancy violations by weak ties and increased levels of interpersonal privacy management are positively associated with having a friends-only profile.

Expressive robots in education: varying the degree of social supportive behavior of a robotic tutor,"Teaching is inherently a social interaction between teacher and student. Despite this knowledge, many educational tools, such as vocabulary training programs, still model the interaction in a tutoring scenario as unidirectional knowledge transfer rather than a social dialog. Therefore, ongoing research aims to develop virtual agents as more appropriate media in education. Virtual agents can induce the perception of a life-like social interaction partner that communicates through natural modalities such as speech, gestures and emotional expressions. This effect can be additionally enhanced with a physical robotic embodiment. This paper presents the development of social supportive behaviors for a robotic tutor to be used in a language learning application. The effect of these behaviors on the learning performance of students was evaluated. The results support that employing social supportive behavior increases learning efficiency of students.","

Bringing the field into focus: user-centered design of a patient expertise locator,"Managing personal aspects of health is challenging for many patients, particularly those facing a serious condition such as cancer. Finding experienced patients, who can share their knowledge from managing a similar health situation, is of tremendous value. Users of health-related social software form a large base of such knowledge, yet these tools often lack features needed to locate peers with expertise. Informed directly by our field work with breast cancer patients, we designed a patient expertise locator for users of online health communities. Using feedback from two focus groups with breast cancer survivors, we took our design through two iterations. Focus groups concluded that expertise locating features proved useful for extending social software. They guided design enhancements by suggesting granular user control through (1) multiple mechanisms to identify expertise, (2) detailed user profiles to select expertise, and (3) varied collaboration levels. Our user-centered approach links field work to design through close collaboration with patients. By illustrating trade-offs made when sharing sensitive health information, our findings inform the incorporation of expertise locating features into social software for patients.","

"What do you know?: experts, novices and territoriality in collaborative systems","When experts participate in collaborative systems, tension may arise between them and novice contributors. In particular, when experts perceive novices as a bother or a threat, the experts may express territoriality: behaviors communicating ownership of a target of interest. In this paper, we describe the results of a user study of a mobile social tagging system deployed within a museum gallery to a group of novices and experts collaboratively tagging part of the collection. We observed that experts express greater feelings of ownership towards their contributions to the system and the museum in general. Experts were more likely than novices to participate at higher rates and to negatively evaluate contributions made by others. We suggest a number of design strategies to balance experts' expressions of territoriality so as to motivate their participation while discouraging exclusionary behaviors.","Experts may feel ownership and territoriality over their contributions, leading to negative evaluation of others' contributions and exclusionary behaviors.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753578,Social Media,CHI,power dynamics
An empirical task analysis of warehouse order picking using head-mounted displays,"Evaluations of task guidance systems often focus on evaluations of new technologies rather than comparing the nuances of interaction across the various systems. One common domain for task guidance systems is warehouse order picking. We present a method involving an easily reproducible ecologically motivated order picking environment for quantitative user studies designed to reveal differences in interactions. Using this environment, we perform a 12 participant within-subjects experiment demonstrating the advantages of a head-mounted display based picking chart over a traditional text-based pick list, a paper-based graphical pick chart, and a mobile pick-by-voice system. The test environment proved sufficiently sensitive, showing statistically significant results along several metrics with the head-mounted display system performing the best. We also provide a detailed analysis of the strategies adopted by our participants.","

The use of Augmented/Virtual Reality technology in warehouse order picking may lead to a decrease in the ability of workers to remember and recall information, as they rely heavily on the technology to guide them through the task.

Where is my team: supporting situation awareness with tactile displays,"A group of friends visiting a crowded and noisy music festival is an example of a situation where knowing the location of other people is important, but where external factors, such as darkness or noise, can limit the ability to keep track of the others. By combining theories about situation awareness and cognitive processing we inferred that communicating information via the sense of touch is a promising approach in such situations. We therefore investigated how to present the location of several people using a tactile torso display. In particular we focused on encoding spatial distances in the tactile signals. We experimentally compared encoding spatial distances in the rhythm, duration, and intensity of a tactile signal. Our findings show that all parameters are suited to encode distances. None of it was clearly outperformed. We then embedded our tactile location encoding into a fast-paced 3D multiplayer game. In this game, team play and the awareness of the team members' locations are crucial for the success in the game. The results provides evidence that the locations of the team members could be processed effectively despite the game's high cognitive demands. In addition, the team equipped with the tactile display showed a better team play and a higher situation awareness.","Over-reliance on technology can lead to decreased situation awareness and cognitive abilities, as people rely more on technology and less on their own senses and abilities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753581,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Clutching at straws: using tangible interaction to provide non-visual access to graphs,"We present a tangible user interface (TUI) called Tangible Graph Builder, that has been designed to allow visually impaired users to access graph and chart-based data. We describe the current paper-based materials used to allow independent graph construction and browsing, before discussing how researchers have applied virtual haptic and non-speech audio techniques to provide more flexible access. We discuss why, although these technologies overcome many of the problems of non-visual graph access, they also introduce new issues and why the application of TUIs is important. An evaluation of Tangible Graph Builder with 12 participants (8 sight deprived, 4 blind) revealed key design requirements for non-visual TUIs, including phicon design and handling marker detection failure. We finish by presenting future work and improvements to our system.","

Effects of automated transcription quality on non-native speakers' comprehension in real-time computer-mediated communication,"Real-time transcription has been shown to be valuable in facilitating non-native speakers' comprehension in real-time communication. Automated speech recognition (ASR) technology is a critical ingredient for its practical deployment. This paper presents a series of studies investigating how the quality of transcripts generated by an ASR system impacts user comprehension and subjective evaluation. Experiments are first presented comparing performance across three different transcription conditions: no transcript, a perfect transcript, and a transcript with Word Error Rate (WER) =20%. We found 20% WER was the most likely critical point for transcripts to be just acceptable and useful. Then we further examined a lower WER of 10% (a lower bound for today's state-of-the-art systems) employing the same experimental design. The results indicated that at 10% WER comprehension performance was significantly improved compared to the no-transcript condition. Finally, implications for further system development and design are discussed.","

The use of Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in real-time transcription can lead to errors in transcription, which can negatively impact user comprehension and subjective evaluation. Even at a low Word Error Rate (WER) of 10%, comprehension performance can be significantly improved compared to no transcript, but still, may not be perfect. This means that users may not always fully understand the transcribed text, which can have negative consequences in situations where accuracy is critical, such as in legal or medical settings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753584,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
"What do people ask their social networks, and why?: a survey study of status message q&a behavior","People often turn to their friends, families, and colleagues when they have questions. The recent, rapid rise of online social networking tools has made doing this on a large scale easy and efficient. In this paper we explore the phenomenon of using social network status messages to ask questions. We conducted a survey of 624 people, asking them to share the questions they have asked and answered of their online social networks. We present detailed data on the frequency of this type of question asking, the types of questions asked, and respondents' motivations for asking their social networks rather than using more traditional search tools like Web search engines. We report on the perceived speed and quality of the answers received, as well as what motivates people to respond to questions seen in their friends' status messages. We then discuss the implications of our findings for the design of next-generation search tools.","People are using social media to ask questions instead of using traditional search engines, which can lead to inaccurate or unreliable information. This can also lead to a lack of critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as people rely on their social networks for answers rather than seeking out information themselves.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753587,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Affirming the self through online profiles: beneficial effects of social networking sites,"Self-affirmation is the process of bringing to awareness important aspects of the self, such as values, goals, and treasured characteristics. When affirmed, individuals are more open-minded and less defensive. This study examines whether social networking tools, such as Facebook, have self-affirming value. Participants were asked to either spend time on their own Facebook profiles, or on a stranger's profile. Afterwards, they were given negative feedback on a task. Participants who spent time on their own profiles were more accepting of the feedback, and less likely to engage in ego-protective mechanisms, such as derogating the task or the evaluator. In fact, they behaved identically to participants who completed a classic self-affirmation manipulation. The theoretical contributions of this paper include (1) identifying intrapersonal effects of online self-presentation and (2) extending self-affirmation theory to include social media use.","Social media can make people more self-centered and less critical of themselves, leading to a lack of self-awareness and personal growth.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753588,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
Improving social game engagement on facebook through enhanced socio-contextual information,"In this paper we describe the results of a controlled study of a social game, Magpies, which was built on the Facebook Online Social Network (OSN) and enhanced with contextual social information in the form of a variety of social network indices. Through comparison with a concurrent control trial using an identical game without the enhanced social information, it was shown that the additional contextual data increased the frequency of social activity between players engaged in the game. Despite this increase in activity, there was little increase in growth of the player-base when compared to the control condition. These findings corroborate previous work that showed how socio-contextual enhancement can increase performance on task-driven games, whilst also suggesting that it can increase activity and engagement when provided as context for non task-driven game environments.","Social Media can increase activity and engagement, but it may not lead to growth or meaningful interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753589,Social Media,CHI,user experience
InAir: sharing indoor air quality measurements and visualizations,"This paper describes inAir, a tool for sharing measurements and visualizations of indoor air quality within one's social network. Poor indoor air quality is difficult for humans to detect through sight and smell alone and can contribute to the development of chronic diseases. Through a four-week long study of fourteen households as six groups, we found that inAir (1) increased awareness of, and reflection on air quality, (2) promoted behavioral changes that resulted in improved indoor air quality, and (3) demonstrated the persuasive power of sharing for furthering improvements to indoor air quality in terms of fostering new social awareness and behavior changes as well as strengthening social bonds and prompting collaborative efforts across social networks to improve human health and well being.","Social media can make people less aware of their surroundings, including the quality of the air they breathe.

Social network activity and social well-being,"Previous research has shown a relationship between use of social networking sites and feelings of social capital. However, most studies have relied on self-reports by college students. The goals of the current study are to (1) validate the common self-report scale using empirical data from Facebook, (2) test whether previous findings generalize to older and international populations, and (3) delve into the specific activities linked to feelings of social capital and loneliness. In particular, we investigate the role of directed interaction between pairs---such as wall posts, comments, and ""likes"" --- and consumption of friends' content, including status updates, photos, and friends' conversations with other friends. We find that directed communication is associated with greater feelings of bonding social capital and lower loneliness, but has only a modest relationship with bridging social capital, which is primarily related to overall friend network size. Surprisingly, users who consume greater levels of content report reduced bridging and bonding social capital and increased loneliness. Implications for designs to support well-being are discussed.","Social Media use can lead to reduced bridging and bonding social capital and increased loneliness, especially when users consume greater levels of content.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753613,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Predicting influence in an online community of creators,"This paper introduces the concept of Online Communities of Creators (OCOCs), which are a subset of social network sites in which the core activity is sharing personal, original creations. Next it defines two distinct types of influence, Project Influence and Social Influence. Project Influence is a measure of the degree to which the community recognizes members' work. Social Influence is a measure of how much a member is a social bridge between otherwise unconnected members. These two types of influence are studied in an online programming community called the Scratch Online Community. Two multiple linear regressions determine the factors that predict each of the two types of influence. The factors predicting each were distinct, suggesting that these are two distinct constructs in this community.","Social Media platforms can create unhealthy competition and pressure to constantly produce content, leading to burnout and decreased well-being for users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753614,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Lurking? cyclopaths?: a quantitative lifecycle analysis of user behavior in a geowiki,"Online communities produce rich behavioral datasets, e.g., Usenet news conversations, Wikipedia edits, and Facebook friend networks. Analysis of such datasets yields important insights (like the ""long tail"" of user participation) and suggests novel design interventions (like targeting users with personalized opportunities and work requests). However, certain key user data typically are unavailable, specifically viewing, pre-registration, and non-logged-in activity. The absence of data makes some questions hard to answer; ac- cess to it can strengthen, extend, or cast doubt on previous results. We report on analysis of user behavior in Cyclopath, a geographic wiki and route-finder for bicyclists. With access to viewing and non-logged-in activity data, we were able to: (a) replicate and extend prior work on user lifecycles in Wikipedia, (b) bring to light some pre-registration activity, thus testing for the presence of ""educational lurking,"" and (c) demonstrate the locality of geographic activity and how editing and viewing are geographically correlated.","

Social media platforms often lack transparency in their data collection and usage, making it difficult for users to understand the full extent of their online activity that is being tracked and how it is being used.

Motivations to participate in online communities,A consistent theoretical and practical challenge in the design of socio-technical systems is that of motivating users to participate in and contribute to them. This study examines the case of Everything2.com users from the theoretical perspectives of Uses and Gratifications and Organizational Commitment to compare individual versus organizational motivations in user participation. We find evidence that users may continue to participate in a site for different reasons than those that led them to the site. Feelings of belonging to a site are important for both anonymous and registered users across different types of uses. Long-term users felt more dissatisfied with the site than anonymous users. Social and cognitive factors seem to be more important than issues of usability in predicting contribution to the site.,"Social Media can lead to dissatisfaction and decreased participation over time, even among users who feel a sense of belonging.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753616,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Detecting professional versus personal closeness using an enterprise social network site,"In this work we analyze the behavior on a company-internal social network site to determine which interaction patterns signal closeness between colleagues. Regression analysis suggests that employee behavior on social network sites (SNSs) reveals information about both professional and personal closeness. While some factors are predictive of general closeness (e.g. content recommendations), other factors signal that employees feel personal closeness towards their colleagues, but not professional closeness (e.g. mutual profile commenting). This analysis contributes to our understanding of how SNS behavior reflects relationship multiplexity: the multiple facets of our relationships with SNS connections.","Social Media can blur the lines between personal and professional relationships, potentially leading to inappropriate or unprofessional behavior in a professional setting.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753622,Social Media,CHI,power dynamics
Pensieve: supporting everyday reminiscence,"Reminiscing is a valuable activity that people of all ages spontaneously and informally partake in as part of their everyday lives. This paper discusses the design and use of Pensieve, a system that supports everyday reminiscence by emailing memory triggers to people that contain either social media content they previously created on third-party websites or text prompts about common life experiences. We discuss how the literature on reminiscence informed Pensieve's design, then analyze data from 91 users over five months. We find that people value spontaneous reminders to reminisce as well as the ability to write about their reminiscing. Shorter, more general triggers draw more responses, as do triggers containing people's own photos-although responses to photos tended to contain more metadata elements than storytelling elements. We compare these results to data from a second, Pensieve-like system developed for Facebook, and suggest a number of important aspects to consider for both designers and researchers around technology and reminiscence.","Social media technology can hinder the ability to reminisce and share meaningful experiences with others, as people become more focused on sharing content on third-party websites rather than engaging in personal reflection and storytelling.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753635,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
"The prayer companion: openness and specificity, materiality and spirituality","In this paper we describe the Prayer Companion, a device we developed as a resource for the spiritual activity of a group of cloistered nuns. The device displays a stream of information sourced from RSS news feeds and social networking sites to suggest possible topics for prayers. The nuns have engaged with the device enthusiastically over the first ten months of an ongoing deployment, and, notwithstanding some initial irritation with the balance of content, report that it plays a significant and continuing role in their prayer life. We discuss how we balanced specificity in the design with a degree of openness for interpretation to create a resource that the nuns could both understand and appropriate, describe the importance of materiality to the device's successful adoption, consider its implications as a design for older people, and reflect on the example it provides of how computation may serve spirituality.","

The article describes a device called the Prayer Companion, which displays a stream of information from RSS news feeds and social networking sites to suggest possible topics for prayers. While the nuns using the device have reported that it plays a significant and continuing role in their prayer life, the use of Social Media technology in this context can be seen as disruptive to their spiritual practice.

Supporting sandtray therapy on an interactive tabletop,"We present the iterative design of a virtual sandtray application for a tabletop display. The purpose of our prototype is to support sandtray therapy, a form of art therapy typically used for younger clients. A significant aspect of this therapy is the insight gained by the therapist as they observe the client interact with the figurines they use to create a scene in the sandtray. In this manner, the therapist can gain increased understanding of the client's psyche. We worked with three sandtray therapists throughout the evolution of our prototype. We describe the details of the three phases of this design process: initial face-to-face meetings, iterative design and development via distance collaboration, and a final face-to-face feedback session. This process revealed that our prototype was sufficient for therapists to gain insight about a person's psyche through their interactions with the virtual sandtray.","
The use of virtual sandtray therapy may lead to a lack of physical touch and tactile sensations, which are important for therapeutic benefits. The reliance on technology may also create a barrier between the therapist and client, potentially limiting the therapist's ability to read nonverbal cues and fully understand the client's psyche.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753651,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Chinese online communities: balancing managementcontrol and individual autonomy,"Existing studies of online social communities mainly focus on communities in the United States. Since Chinese social beliefs and behaviors largely differ from that of Americans, we hypothesize that Chinese online communities also greatly differ from their U.S. counterparts. In particular, we believe that Chinese online communities must balance management control and individual autonomy to accommodate both Chinese tradition and the social nature of online societies. In this paper, we present three studies to test our hypothesis. First, we use a structured observation (Study I) to examine community governance practices of 32 Chinese and American social sites. Based on the identified community governance practices, we use a cross-cultural survey of 208 Chinese and Americans (Study II) to learn about their behavior and attitude toward these practices. Finally, we interview 38 Chinese users (Study III) to help us further understand how Chinese online communities balance the needs of management and users. Not only do the studies confirm our hypothesis, but they also help us abstract two key design implications of social software to meet the needs of Chinese.","

Multi-touch techniques for exploring large-scale 3D astrophysical simulations,"Enabling efficient exploration of large-scale virtual environments such as those simulating astrophysical environments is highly challenging. Astrophysical virtual worlds span exceptionally large spatial scales occupied mostly by empty space, and this makes it difficult for the user to comprehend the spatial context during exploratory navigation. Public exhibits, where novice users have little experience using complicated virtual navigation interfaces, pose additional challenges. To address these issues, we propose multi-touch techniques to deliver an effective interface to navigate the unique features of large-scale 3D environments such as astrophysical simulations. In this work, we carefully study conventional multi-touch methods and adapt them to the practical requirements of this application. A novel technique called the powers-of-ten ladder is introduced to support efficient movement across huge spatial scales using multi-touch interactions. We also investigate user experiences with various multi-touch finger gestures on our prototype digital planetarium.","Users may struggle to comprehend the spatial context of virtual environments, especially in large-scale astrophysical simulations, due to the vast empty spaces.

Identifying drivers and hindrances of social user experience in web services,"Social activity is becoming a central contributor to user experience (UX) in many modern Web services. The motivations, norms and rules of online communities have been widely researched, however, social activity and its UX in modern Web services is a less studied area. We conducted a four-week-long field study with three Web services -- Facebook, Nokia Sports Tracker and Dopplr -- which all support social activity. The aim of this study was to identify the central drivers and hindrances of social UX, user experience of online social activity. Our results show that the main drivers of social UX include self-expression, reciprocity, learning and curiosity, whereas unsuitability of content and functionality, incompleteness of user networks and lack of trust and privacy are often experienced as hindrances for social UX. Our findings also reveal the pragmatic and hedonic nature of the drivers and hindrances. The results can be used to inform design and evaluation of social UX in Web services.","Social Media can lead to a lack of trust and privacy, unsuitability of content and functionality, and incompleteness of user networks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753704,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
After access: challenges facing mobile-only internet users in the developing world,"This study reports results of an ethnographic action research study, exploring mobile-centric internet use. Over the course of 13 weeks, eight women, each a member of a livelihoods collective in urban Cape Town, South Africa, received training to make use of the data (internet) features on the phones they already owned. None of the women had previous exposure to PCs or the internet. Activities focused on social networking, entertainment, information search, and, in particular, job searches. Results of the exercise reveal both the promise of, and barriers to, mobile internet use by a potentially large community of first-time, mobile-centric users.

Touching the void: direct-touch interaction for intangible displays,"In this paper, we explore the challenges in applying and investigate methodologies to improve direct-touch interaction on intangible displays. Direct-touch interaction simplifies object manipulation, because it combines the input and display into a single integrated interface. While traditional tangible display-based direct-touch technology is commonplace, similar direct-touch interaction within an intangible display paradigm presents many challenges. Given the lack of tactile feedback, direct-touch interaction on an intangible display may show poor performance even on the simplest of target acquisition tasks. In order to study this problem, we have created a prototype of an intangible display. In the initial study, we collected user discrepancy data corresponding to the interpretation of 3D location of targets shown on our intangible display. The result showed that participants performed poorly in determining the z-coordinate of the targets and were imprecise in their execution of screen touches within the system. Thirty percent of positioning operations showed errors larger than 30mm from the actual surface. This finding triggered our interest to design a second study, in which we quantified task time in the presence of visual and audio feedback. The pseudo-shadow visual feedback was shown to be helpful both in improving user performance and satisfaction.","

Making sense of strangers' expertise from signals in digital artifacts,"Contemporary work increasingly involves interacting with strangers in technology-mediated environments. In this context, we come to rely on digital artifacts to infer characteristics of other people. This paper reports the results of a study conducted in a global company that used expertise search as a vehicle for exploring how people interpret a range of information available in online profiles in evaluating whom to interact with for expertise. Using signaling theory as a conceptual framework, we describe how certain 'signals' in various social software are hard to fake, and are thus more reliable indicators of expertise. Multi-level regression analysis revealed that participation in social software, social connection information, and self-described expertise in the corporate directory were significantly helpful in the decision to contact someone for expertise. Qualitative analysis provided further insights regarding the interpretations people form of others' expertise from digital artifacts. We conclude with suggestions on differentiating various types of information available within online profiles and implications for the design of expertise locator/recommender systems.","

Simulated augmented reality windshield display as a cognitive mapping aid for elder driver navigation,"A common effect of aging is decline in spatial cognition. This is an issue for all elders, but particularly for elder drivers. To address this driving issue, we propose a novel concept of an in-vehicle navigation display system that displays navigation information directly onto the vehicle's windshield, superimposing it on the driver's view of the actual road. An evaluation of our simulated version of this display shows that it results in a significant reduction in navigation errors and distraction-related measures compared to a typical in-car navigation display for elder drivers. These results help us understand how context-sensitive information and a simulated augmented reality representation can be combined to minimize the cognitive load in translating between virtual/information spaces and the real world.","Elderly drivers may become too reliant on technology and neglect their natural spatial cognition abilities, leading to decreased mental sharpness and potential accidents.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518724,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
PenLight: combining a mobile projector and a digital pen for dynamic visual overlay,"Digital pen systems, originally designed to digitize annotations made on physical paper, are evolving to permit a wider variety of applications. Although the type and quality of pen feedback (e.g., haptic, audio, and visual) have a huge impact on advancing the digital pen technology, dynamic visual feedback has yet to be fully investigated. In parallel, miniature projectors are an emerging technology with the potential to enhance visual feedback for small mobile computing devices. In this paper we present the PenLight system, which is a testbed to explore the interaction design space and its accompanying interaction techniques in a digital pen embedded with a spatially-aware miniature projector.

The VoiceBot: a voice controlled robot arm,"We present a system whereby the human voice may specify continuous control signals to manipulate a simulated 2D robotic arm and a real 3D robotic arm. Our goal is to move towards making accessible the manipulation of everyday objects to individuals with motor impairments. Using our system, we performed several studies using control style variants for both the 2D and 3D arms. Results show that it is indeed possible for a user to learn to effectively manipulate real-world objects with a robotic arm using only non-verbal voice as a control mechanism. Our results provide strong evidence that the further development of non-verbal voice controlled robotics and prosthetic limbs will be successful.","

The development of non-verbal voice-controlled robotics and prosthetic limbs may lead to a decrease in the use of verbal communication, potentially isolating individuals who rely on these technologies and limiting their social interactions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518731,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
"Make new friends, but keep the old: recommending people on social networking sites","This paper studies people recommendations designed to help users find known, offline contacts and discover new friends on social networking sites. We evaluated four recommender algorithms in an enterprise social networking site using a personalized survey of 500 users and a field study of 3,000 users. We found all algorithms effective in expanding users' friend lists. Algorithms based on social network information were able to produce better-received recommendations and find more known contacts for users, while algorithms using similarity of user-created content were stronger in discovering new friends. We also collected qualitative feedback from our survey users and draw several meaningful design implications.","

Predicting tie strength with social media,"Social media treats all users the same: trusted friend or total stranger, with little or nothing in between. In reality, relationships fall everywhere along this spectrum, a topic social science has investigated for decades under the theme of tie strength. Our work bridges this gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we present a predictive model that maps social media data to tie strength. The model builds on a dataset of over 2,000 social media ties and performs quite well, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 85% accuracy. We complement these quantitative findings with interviews that unpack the relationships we could not predict. The paper concludes by illustrating how modeling tie strength can improve social media design elements, including privacy controls, message routing, friend introductions and information prioritization.","Social media platforms treat all users the same, regardless of the strength of their relationships, which can lead to a lack of nuance in privacy controls, message routing, and other design elements.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518736,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Social computing privacy concerns: antecedents and effects,"Social computing systems are increasingly a part of people's social environment. Inherent to such communities is the collection and sharing of personal information, which in turn may raise concerns about privacy. In this study, we extend prior research on internet privacy to address questions about antecedents of privacy concerns in social computing communities, as well as the impact of privacy concerns in such communities. The results indicate that users' trust in other community members, and the community's information sharing norms have a negative impact on community-specific privacy concerns. We also find that community-specific privacy concerns not only lead users to adopt more restrictive information sharing settings, but also reduce the amount of information they share with the community. In addition, we find that information sharing is impacted by network centrality and the tenure of the user in the community. Implications of the study for research and practice are discussed.","Privacy concerns in social computing communities may lead to reduced information sharing and increased adoption of restrictive settings, negatively impacting the community's overall usefulness and collaboration.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518754,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Longitudinal study of people learning to use continuous voice-based cursor control,"We conducted a 2.5 week longitudinal study with five motor impaired (MI) and four non-impaired (NMI) participants, in which they learned to use the Vocal Joystick, a voice-based user interface control system. We found that the participants were able to learn the mapping between the vowel sounds and directions used by the Vocal Joystick, and showed marked improvement in their target acquisition performance. At the end of the ten session period, the NMI group reached the same level of performance as the previously measured ""expert"" Vocal Joystick performance, and the MI group was able to reach 70% of that level. Two of the MI participants were also able to approach the performance of their preferred device, a touchpad. We report on a number of issues that can inform the development of further enhancements in the realm of voice-driven computer control.","
The study found that participants, especially those with motor impairments, were able to learn and improve their performance in using voice-based user interface control systems. However, this improvement came at the cost of reduced performance in their preferred device, a touchpad, for two of the motor-impaired participants. This suggests that there may be a trade-off between the benefits of voice-based interfaces and the proficiency of other interfaces, which could be a concern for individuals who rely on multiple interfaces for daily activities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518757,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Learning from IKEA hacking: i'm not one to decoupage a tabletop and call it a day.,"We present a qualitative study based on interviews with nine IKEA Hackers - people who go online to share the process of repurposing IKEA products to create personalized objects.

We discuss the motivations for IKEA hacking and explore the impact of information technology on do-it-yourself culture, design, and HCI.","Social Media can lead to an emergent practice of repurposing products, which can result in an unintended consequence of creating a culture of DIY hacking, where people feel compelled to constantly create and share their own products, leading to burnout and decreased creativity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518768,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Autism online: a comparison of word usage in bloggers with and without autism spectrum disorders,"The Internet has become a place of refuge for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular, weblogs are a popular option for personal expression via the Internet. Perhaps this means of communication is well suited to bypassing deficits in social interaction and communication that characterize ASD. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionaries [10], we compared blogs of individuals with ASD to the writing of neurotypical (NT) bloggers. We found that rates of word usage were nearly identical in the two groups with one exception - there was more variation in the use of social words in ASD compared to NT blogs. This similarity in language between ASD and NT authors suggests that communication deficits routinely found in people with ASD may be due to the social context in which their communication skills are tested, and that the affordances of asynchronous computer-mediated communication may offer alternative means of testing and expression.",Social Media technology may be worsening communication deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) due to the social context in which their communication skills are tested.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518775,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
SLAP widgets: bridging the gap between virtual and physical controls on tabletops,"We present Silicone iLluminated Active Peripherals (SLAP), a system of tangible, translucent widgets for use on multitouch tabletops. SLAP Widgets are cast from silicone or made of acrylic, and include sliders, knobs, keyboards, and buttons. They add tactile feedback to multi-touch tables, improving input accuracy. Using rear projection, SLAP Widgets can be relabeled dynamically, providing inexpensive, battery-free, and untethered augmentations. Furthermore, SLAP combines the flexibility of virtual objects with physical affordances. We evaluate how SLAP Widgets influence the user experience on tabletops compared to virtual controls. Empirical studies show that SLAPWidgets are easy to use and outperform virtual controls significantly in terms of accuracy and overall interaction time.","

The use of SLAP widgets, which are tangible and translucent, can lead to a decrease in the use of virtual controls, which are intangible and immaterial. This can result in a decrease in the development of fine motor skills, as users rely more on physical objects to interact with technology, rather than using their fingers and hands to manipulate virtual objects on a screen. Additionally, the use of SLAP widgets can also lead to a decrease in the use of imagination and creativity, as users are limited to the physical objects available to them, rather than being able to create and manipulate virtual objects in a virtual environment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518779,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
In CMC we trust: the role of similarity,"This paper examines how different forms of linguistic similarity in a text-chat environment relate to the establishment of interpersonal trust. Sixty-two pairs played an iterative social dilemma investment game and periodically communicated via Instant Messenger (IM). Novel automated and manual analysis techniques identify linguistic similarity at content, structural and stylistic levels. Results reveal that certain types of content (some positive emotion words, task-related words), structural (verb tense, phrasal entrainment), and stylistic (emoticons) similarity characterize high trusting pairs while other types of similarity (e.g., negative emotion words) characterize low trusting pairs. Contrary to previous literature, this suggests that not all similarity is good similarity.","Social Media can make people less trustworthy.

The article states that certain types of language used in Social Media, such as negative emotion words, are associated with low trusting pairs, while positive emotion words and task-related words are associated with high trusting pairs.

Of social television comes home: a field study of communication choices and practices in tv-based text and voice chat,"Social television applications have emerged as a potentially valuable convergence of media and communication, but questions remain about the utility and nature of the communication experiences they will provide. We present our study of STV3, an application that adds freeform text and voice chat capabilities to the conventional television-viewing experience. We conducted an in-depth field study of STV3 to understand how friends integrate communication through social television into their lives. Our results reveal users' choices of communication modality, their topics of conversation, and the sense of connectedness that was fostered through their use of STV3. Our findings indicate that participants overwhelmingly preferred text chat to voice chat, and that they often communicated about topics unrelated to the television content.","

The study found that users preferred text chat over voice chat, indicating a potential decline in verbal communication skills and a reliance on written communication.

An elementary social information foraging model,"User interfaces and information systems have become increasingly social in recent years, aimed at supporting the decentralized, cooperative production and use of content. A theory that predicts the impact of interface and interaction designs on such factors as participation rates and knowledge discovery is likely to be useful.

Remembrance of things tagged: how tagging effort affects tag production and human memory,"We developed a low-effort interaction method called Click2Tag for social bookmarking. Information foraging theory predicts that the production of tags will increase as the effort required to do so is lowered, while the amount of time invested decreases. However, models of human memory suggest that changes in the tagging process may affect subsequent human memory for the tagged material. We compared (1) low-effort tagging by mouse-clicking (Click2Tag), (2) traditional tagging by typing (type-to-tag), and (3) baseline, no tagging conditions. Our results suggest that (a) Click2Tag increases tagging rates, (b) Click2Tag improves recognition of facts from the tagged text when compared to type-to-tag, and (c) Click2Tag is comparable to the no-tagging baseline condition on recall measures. Results suggest that tagging by clicking strengthens the memory traces by repeated readings of relevant words in the text and, thus, improves recognition.","Social Media technology can lead to decreased effort and time invested in information processing, potentially affecting human memory and recognition abilities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518796,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Signpost from the masses: learning effects in an exploratory social tag search browser,"Social tagging arose out of the need to organize found content that is worth revisiting. A significant side effect has been the use of social tagging sites as navigational signposts for interesting content. The collective behavior of users who tagged contents seems to offer a good basis for exploratory search interfaces, even for users who are not using social bookmarking sites. In this paper, we present the design of a tag-based exploratory system and detail an experiment in understanding its effectiveness. The tag-based search system allows users to utilize relevance feedback on tags to indicate their interest in various topics, enabling rapid exploration of the topic space. The experiment shows that the system seems to provide a kind of scaffold for users to learn new topics.","Social Media can lead to addiction and distraction, taking away from productive time and potentially harming mental health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518797,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Facts or friends?: distinguishing informational and conversational questions in social Q&A sites,"Tens of thousands of questions are asked and answered every day on social question and answer (Q&A) Web sites such as Yahoo Answers. While these sites generate an enormous volume of searchable data, the problem of determining which questions and answers are archival quality has grown. One major component of this problem is the prevalence of conversational questions, identified both by Q&A sites and academic literature as questions that are intended simply to start discussion. For example, a conversational question such as ""do you believe in evolution?"" might successfully engage users in discussion, but probably will not yield a useful web page for users searching for information about evolution. Using data from three popular Q&A sites, we confirm that humans can reliably distinguish between these conversational questions and other informational questions, and present evidence that conversational questions typically have much lower potential archival value than informational questions. Further, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to automatically classify questions as conversational or informational, learning in the process about categorical, linguistic, and social differences between different question types. Our algorithms approach human performance, attaining 89.7% classification accuracy in our experiments.","Social media platforms prioritize engagement over informational value, leading to a surfeit of low-quality content that is not useful for users seeking information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518819,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
Feed me: motivating newcomer contribution in social network sites,"Social networking sites (SNS) are only as good as the content their users share. Therefore, designers of SNS seek to improve the overall user experience by encouraging members to contribute more content. However, user motivations for contribution in SNS are not well understood. This is particularly true for newcomers, who may not recognize the value of contribution. Using server log data from approximately 140,000 newcomers in Facebook, we predict long-term sharing based on the experiences the newcomers have in their first two weeks. We test four mechanisms: social learning, singling out, feedback, and distribution. In particular, we find support for social learning: newcomers who see their friends contributing go on to share more content themselves. For newcomers who are initially inclined to contribute, receiving feedback and having a wide audience are also predictors of increased sharing. On the other hand, singling out appears to affect only those newcomers who are not initially inclined to share. The paper concludes with design implications for motivating newcomer sharing in online communities.","Social Media platforms are designed to encourage users to contribute more content, but this can lead to users feeling pressure to share more than they want to, and feeling like they are being watched and judged by others.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518847,Social Media,CHI,user experience
'Helpfulness' in online communities: a measure of message quality,"Online communities displaying textual postings require measures to combat information overload. One popular approach is to ask participants whether or not messages are helpful in order to then guide others to interesting content. Adopting a well-established framework for assessing data quality, we examine the nature of ""helpfulness.""We study consumer reviews at Amazon.com, deriving 22 measures quantifying their textual properties, authors' reputations and product characteristics. Confirmatory factor analysis reveals five underlying quality dimensions representing reviewers' reputations in the community, the topical relevancy of the reviews, the ease of understanding them, their believability and objectivity. A correlation and regression analysis confirms that these dimensions are related to the helpfulness scores assigned by community participants. However, it also uncovers a strong relationship between the chronological ordering of reviews and helpfulness, which both community participants and designers should keep in mind when using this method of social navigation.","Information overload due to the sheer volume of posts, leading to the need for measures to combat it.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518848,Social Media,CHI,access to information & discourse
The problem of conflicting social spheres: effects of network structure on experienced tension in social network sites,"We propose that a fundamental property of human psychology, the need to maintain independent social spheres, imposes constraints on the use of social network sites (SNS). We particularly focus on the consequences of visibility of communications across social spheres, and we hypothesize that technological features of SNS may bring social spheres in conflict, thus leading to increased levels of online social tension. A survey study among Facebook users was conducted to test this hypothesis. Results showed that diversity of the Facebook network predicted online tension. Moreover, the number of kin in a Facebook network was a crucial component because it predicted online tension whereas number of work and social contacts did not. Further, evidence was found to support the idea that tension might impose an upper limit on network size. We conclude with a discussion of these findings and describe how they support the thrust of recent modifications to SNS designs.","Social Media technology may bring social spheres in conflict, leading to increased levels of online social tension.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518849,Social Media,CHI,politics
SiteLens: situated visualization techniques for urban site visits,"Urban designers and urban planners often conduct site visits prior to a design activity to search for patterns or better understand existing conditions. We introduce SiteLens, an experimental system and set of techniques for supporting site visits by visualizing relevant virtual data directly in the context of the physical site, which we call situated visualization. We address alternative visualization representations and techniques for data collection, curation, discovery, comparison, manipulation, and provenance. A real use scenario is presented and two iterations of evaluation with faculty and students from the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation provide directions and insight for further investigation.","

The use of virtual data visualization in site visits can lead to a disconnection between the physical and virtual representations of a site, potentially resulting in a lack of understanding of the actual conditions and limitations of the physical space.

Additionally, over-reliance on virtual data can also lead to a lack of human connection and observation, which is important for understanding the social and cultural context of a site.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518871,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Body and mind: a study of avatar personalization in three virtual worlds,"An increasingly large number of users connect to virtual worlds on a regular basis to conduct activities ranging from gaming to business meetings. In all these worlds, users project themselves into the environment via an avatar: a 3D body which they control and whose appearance is often customizable. However, considering the prevalence of this form of embodiment, there is a surprising lack of data about how and why users customize their avatar, as well as how easy and satisfying the existing avatar creation tools are. In this paper, we report on a study investigating these issues through a questionnaire administered to more than a hundred users of three virtual worlds offering widely different avatar creation and customization systems (Maple Story, World of Warcraft, and Second Life). We illustrate the often-surprising choices users make when creating their digital representation and discuss the impact of our findings for the design of future avatar creation systems.","

Capturing and sharing memories in a virtual world,"Virtual worlds (VWs) such as Second Life® (SL) contain a rich social culture where people engage in a multitude of experiences much like real life. With this comes the need to capture and share memories with others. To understand what tools people use to accomplish this and what limitations they may face, we conducted interviews with participants in SL. Our results identify two clusters of users - Casuals and Lifers - who differed in the ways in which they captured and shared memories. Here we describe the use of photos, landmarks, friend lists, and conversation logs. We also show how a lack of real life physical and social constraints in the VW affects user routines, and, in some cases, how it does not. This suggests design directions for memory tools in the VW and also real life that break the bounds of current everyday practice.","

The article highlights the potential for people to become too immersed in virtual worlds, leading to a blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy.

Results indicate that hospital patients with low health literacy found the system easy to use, reported high levels of satisfaction, and most said they preferred receiving the discharge information from the agent over their doctor or nurse. Patients also expressed appreciation for the time and attention provided by the virtual nurse, and felt that it provided an additional authoritative source for their medical information.","

Coordination in collective intelligence: the role of team structure and task interdependence,"The success of Wikipedia has demonstrated the power of peer production in knowledge building. However, unlike many other examples of collective intelligence, tasks in Wikipedia can be deeply interdependent and may incur high coordination costs among editors. Increasing the number of editors increases the resources available to the system, but it also raises the costs of coordination. This suggests that the dependencies of tasks in Wikipedia may determine whether they benefit from increasing the number of editors involved. Specifically, we hypothesize that adding editors may benefit low-coordination tasks but have negative consequences for tasks requiring a high degree of coordination. Furthermore, concentrating the work to reduce coordination dependencies should enable more efficient work by many editors. Analyses of both article ratings and article review comments provide support for both hypotheses. These results suggest ways to better harness the efforts of many editors in social collaborative systems involving high coordination tasks.","Social Media technology can lead to high coordination costs among editors, which can negatively impact tasks requiring a high degree of coordination.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518928,Social Media,CHI,power dynamics
TouchBall: a design and evaluation of a hand-held trackball based touch-haptic interface,"In this paper, we present a design and an evaluation of a hand-held trackball based touch-haptic interface, named ""TouchBall."" Using a trackball mechanism, the device provides flexibility in terms of directional degrees of freedom. It also has an advantage of a direct transfer of force feedback through frictional touch (with high sensitivity), thus requiring only relatively small amount of inertia. This leads to a compact hand-held design appropriate for mobile and 3D interactive applications. The device is evaluated for the detection thresholds for directions of the force feedback and the perceived amount of directional force. The refined directionality information should combine with other modalities with less sensory conflict, enriching the user experience for a given application.","

The three-sixty illusion: designing for immersion in pervasive games,"Pervasive games are staged in reality and their main attractiveness is generated by using reality as a resource in the game. Yet, most pervasive games that use mobile and location-based technology use reality only in a weak sense, as the location for a computerized game. In this article we analyze two game practices, Nordic style live action role-playing (larp) and alternate reality games (ARG), that instead use reality as their main game resource. We analyze how they go about creating a believable game world and encourage the players to actively take part in this world. We present two example games that do the same with the support of technology, effectively realizing an immersive game world through a combination of physical play and technology-supported play.","Over-reliance on technology, leading to decreased interaction with the physical world and potentially negative impacts on social skills and mental health.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518939,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
Bringing design considerations to the mobile phone and driving debate,"Though legislation is increasingly discouraging drivers from holding on to their mobile phones while talking, hands-free devices do not improve driver safety. We offer two design alternatives to improve driver safety in the contexts of voice-based user interfaces and mobile phone conversations in cars' side tones (auditory feedback used in landline phones) and location of speakers. In a 2 (side tone: present vs. not) x 2 (location of speakers: headphones vs. dashboard) between-participants experiment (N=48), we investigated the impact of these features upon driver experience and performance on a simulated mobile phone conversation while driving. Participants became more verbally engaged in the conversation when side tones were present, but also experienced more cognitive load. Participants drove more safely when voices were projected from the dashboard rather than from headphones. Implications for driver user interface design are discussed.",Voice Assistant technology can increase cognitive load and decrease driver safety.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518952,Voice Assistant,CHI,health & well-being
A comparison of mobile money-transfer UIs for non-literate and semi-literate users,"Due to the increasing penetration of mobile phones even into poor communities, mobile payment schemes could bring formal financial services to the ""unbanked"". However, because poverty for the most part also correlates with low levels of formal education, there are questions as to whether electronic access to complex financial services is enough to bridge the gap, and if so, what sort of UI is best. In this paper, we present two studies that provide preliminary answers to these questions. We first investigated the usability of existing mobile payment services, through an ethnographic study involving 90 subjects in India, Kenya, the Philippines and South Africa. This was followed by a usability study with another 58 subjects in India, in which we compared non-literate and semi-literate subjects on three systems: text-based, spoken dialog (without text), and rich multimedia (also without text). Results confirm that non-text designs are strongly preferred over text-based designs and that while task-completion rates are better for the rich multimedia UI, speed is faster and less assistance is required on the spoken-dialog system.","
The article highlights the potential for mobile payment schemes to bring formal financial services to the ""unbanked"" but raises concerns about the usability of these services for those with low levels of formal education. The study found that non-text designs were strongly preferred over text-based designs, but task-completion rates were better for the rich multimedia UI, while speed and assistance were better for the spoken-dialog system. This suggests that while technology can provide access to financial services, it may not be enough to bridge the gap for those who are not familiar with technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518970,Voice Assistant,CHI,equality & justice
With a little help from my friends: examining the impact of social annotations in sensemaking tasks,"In prior work we reported on the design of a social annotation system, SparTag.us, for use in sensemaking activities such as work-group reading and report writing. Previous studies of note-taking systems have demonstrated behavioral differences in social annotation practices, but are not clear in the actual performance gains provided by social features. This paper presents a laboratory study aimed at evaluating the learning effect of social features in SparTag.us. We found significant learning gains, and consider implications for design and for understanding the underlying mechanisms in play when people use social annotation systems.",Social Media can lead to a decrease in productivity and performance as people become distracted by social features and prioritize social interaction over task completion.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518977,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Like bees around the hive: a comparative study of a mobile augmented reality map,"We present findings from field trials of MapLens, a mobile augmented reality (AR) map using a magic lens over a paper map. Twenty-six participants used MapLens to play a location-based game in a city centre. Comparisons to a group of 11 users with a standard 2D mobile map uncover phenomena that arise uniquely when interacting with AR features in the wild. The main finding is that AR features facilitate place-making by creating a constant need for referencing to the physical, and in that it allows for ease of bodily configurations for the group, encourages establishment of common ground, and thereby invites discussion, negotiation and public problem-solving. The main potential of AR maps lies in their use as a collaborative tool.","

"A tag in the hand: supporting semantic, social, and spatial navigation in museums","Designers of mobile, social systems must carefully think about how to help their users manage spatial, semantic, and social modes of navigation. Here, we describe our deployment of MobiTags, a system to help museum visitors interact with a collection of ""open storage"" exhibits, those where the museum provides little curatorial information. MobiTags integrates social tagging, art information, and a map to support navigation and collaborative curation of these open storage collections. We studied 23 people's use of MobiTags in a local museum, combining interview data with device use logs and tracking of people's movements to understand how MobiTags affected their navigation and experience in the museum. Despite a lack of social cues, people feel a strong sense of social presence--and social pressure--through seeing others' tags. The tight coupling of tags, item information, and map features also supported a rich set of practices around these modes of navigation.","Social Media can create a false sense of social presence and pressure, potentially leading to negative experiences for users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1518999,Social Media,CHI,user experience

The developed tool uses visual markers to associate digital resources with physical artefacts. We present the iterative development of the tool through a user centred design process and demonstrate its use by domain experts to realise two distinct hybrid exhibits. The process of design and refinement of the tool highlights the need to adopt an experience oriented approach allowing authors to think in terms of the physical and digital ""things"" that comprise a hybrid experience rather than in terms of the underlying technical components.","

A mobile voice communication system in medical setting: love it or hate it?,"Hospital work coordination and collaboration often requires mobility for acquiring proper information and resources. In turn, the spatial distribution and the mobility of clinicians can curtail the opportunities for effective communications making collaboration difficult. In this situation, a mobile hands-free voice communication system, Vocera, was introduced to enhance communication. It supports quick and impromptu conversations among coworkers for work coordination and collaboration anytime and anywhere. We study this deployment and present our findings concerning the impact of this communication system on the information flow. Our information flow framework's communication strategies help contrast the information processes before and after the deployment of Vocera.","

Clinical evaluations and collaborative design: developing new technologies for mental healthcare interventions,"Ethical requirements, severe constraints on access to end users and the necessity of real-world clinical evaluations represent significant challenges to designers of new technologies in mental healthcare (MHC) settings. This paper describes the collaborative approaches, incorporating HCI methods with input for MHC professionals and MHC theory, which were applied in the development of Personal Investigator (PI), a 3D computer game developed to support adolescent mental health interventions. Different stages in the evaluation of PI are discussed and the lessons learned through a multi-site clinical evaluation are presented. This evaluation has provided strong initial evidence that games such as PI offer the potential to improve adolescent engagement in talk-based interventions. It has also provided an insight into factors which should be considered in future designs in the MHC domain, e.g. the need to incorporate high levels of adaptability in future systems.

Blogging at work and the corporate attention economy,"The attention economy motivates participation in peer-produced sites on the Web like YouTube and Wikipedia. However, this economy appears to break down at work. We studied a large internal corporate blogging community using log files and interviews and found that employees expected to receive attention when they contributed to blogs, but these expectations often went unmet. Like in the external blogosphere, a few people received most of the attention, and many people received little or none. Employees expressed frustration if they invested time and received little or no perceived return on investment. While many corporations are looking to adopt Web-based communication tools like blogs, wikis, and forums, these efforts will fail unless employees are motivated to participate and contribute content. We identify where the attention economy breaks down in a corporate blog community and suggest mechanisms for improvement.","Social Media technology can create unrealistic expectations for attention and recognition, leading to frustration and decreased motivation among users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1518701.1519016,Social Media,CHI,user experience

"I'm sorry, Dave: i'm afraid i won't do that: social aspects of human-agent conflict","As computational agents become more sophisticated, it will frequently be necessary for the agents to disagree with users. In these cases, it might be useful for the agent to use politeness strategies that defuse the person's frustrations and preserve the human-computer relationship. One such strategy is distancing, which we implemented by spatially distancing an agent's voice from its body. In a 2 (agent disagreement: none vs. some) x 2 (agent voice location: on robotic body vs. in control box) between-participants experiment, we studied the effects of agent disagreement and agent voice location in a collaborative human-agent desert survival task (N=40). People changed their answers more often when agents disagreed with them and felt more similar to agents that always agreed with them, even when substantive content was identical. Strikingly, people felt more positively toward the disagreeing agent whose voice came from a separate control box rather than from its body; for agreement, the body-attached voice was preferred.","

Ambient social tv: drawing people into a shared experience,We examine how ambient displays can augment social television. Social TV 2 is an interactive television solution that incorporates two ambient displays to convey to participants an aggregate view of their friends' current TV-watching status. Social TV 2 also allows users to see which television shows friends and family are watching and send lightweight messages from within the TV-viewing experience. Through a two-week field study we found the ambient displays to be an integral part of the experience. We present the results of our field study with a discussion of the implications for future social systems in the home.,"

Social Media technology can make people feel pressure to conform to what others are watching or doing, leading to a loss of individuality and autonomy.

Temporal trajectories in shared interactive narratives,"Temporal trajectories can represent the complex mappings between story time and clock time that are to be found in shared interactive narratives such as computer games and interactive performances. There are three kinds. Canonical trajectories express an author's intended mapping of story time onto clock time as part of the plot and schedule of an experience. Participant trajectories reflect a participant's actual journey through story time and clock time as they interact with the experience. Historic trajectories represent the subsequent selection and reuse of segments of recorded participant trajectories to create histories of past events. We show how temporal trajectories help us analyse the nature of time in existing experiences and can also generate new approaches to dealing with temporal issues such as: disengagement and reengagement, adapting to different paces of interaction, synchronising different participants, and enabling encounters and travel across time.","Disengagement and reengagement issues.

WallCology: designing interaction affordances for learner engagement in authentic science inquiry,"The broadening array of technologies available to support the design of classroom activity has the potential to reshape science learning in schools. This paper presents a ubiquitous computing application, WallCology, which situates a virtual ecosystem within the unseen space of classroom walls, presenting affordances for science learners to engage in investigations of ecological phenomena. Motivated by a desire to foster authenticity in classroom science inquiry, WallCology extends the ""embedded phenomena"" framework in three ways: by enabling collaborative investigations among distributed work teams, by increasing the physicality of investigation activities, and by expanding the loci of activity sites. Pilot studies in two urban classrooms provide qualified support for the effectiveness of WallCology in promoting more authentic inquiry practices, content learning, and attitudes regarding scientific investigations.","

Reality-based interaction: a framework for post-WIMP interfaces,"We are in the midst of an explosion of emerging human-computer interaction techniques that redefine our understanding of both computers and interaction. We propose the notion of Reality-Based Interaction (RBI) as a unifying concept that ties together a large subset of these emerging interaction styles. Based on this concept of RBI, we provide a framework that can be used to understand, compare, and relate current paths of recent HCI research as well as to analyze specific interaction designs. We believe that viewing interaction through the lens of RBI provides insights for design and uncovers gaps or opportunities for future research.","

The over-reliance on Reality-Based Interaction (RBI) techniques in Augmented/Virtual Reality technology may lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and social skills, as people become more comfortable interacting with technology than with other humans.

Handsaw: tangible exploration of volumetric data by direct cut-plane projection,"Tangible User Interfaces are well-suited to handling three-dimensional data sets by direct manipulation of real objects in space, but current interfaces can make it difficult to look inside dense volumes of information. This paper presents the Handsaw, a system that detects a virtual cut-plane projected by an outstretched hand or laser-line directly on an object or space and reveals sectional data on an adjacent display. By leaving the hands free and using a remote display, these techniques can be shared between multiple users and integrated into everyday practice. The Handsaw has been prototyped for scientific visualizations in medicine, engineering and urban design. User evaluations suggest that using a hand is more intuitive while projected light is more precise than keyboard and mouse control, and the Handsaw system has the potential to be used effectively by novices and in groups.","

Collaborative editing for improved usefulness and usability of transcript-enhanced webcasts,"One challenge in facilitating skimming or browsing through archives of on-line recordings of webcast lectures is the lack of text transcripts of the recorded lecture. Ideally, transcripts would be obtainable through Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, current ASR systems can only deliver, in realistic lecture conditions, a Word Error Rate of around 45% -- above the accepted threshold of 25%. In this paper, we present the iterative design of a webcast extension that engages users to collaborate in a wiki-like manner on editing the ASR-produced imperfect transcripts, and show that this is a feasible solution for improving the quality of lecture transcripts. We also present the findings of a field study carried out in a real lecture environment investigating how students use and edit the transcripts.","

MySong: automatic accompaniment generation for vocal melodies,"We introduce MySong, a system that automatically chooses chords to accompany a vocal melody. A user with no musical experience can create a song with instrumental accompaniment just by singing into a microphone, and can experiment with different styles and chord patterns using interactions designed to be intuitive to non-musicians. We describe the implementation of MySong, which trains a Hidden Markov Model using a music database and uses that model to select chords for new melodies. Model parameters are intuitively exposed to the user. We present results from a study demonstrating that chords assigned to melodies using MySong and chords assigned manually by musicians receive similar subjective ratings. We then present results from a second study showing that thirteen users with no background in music theory are able to rapidly create musical accompaniments using MySong, and that these accompaniments are rated positively by evaluators.","

The development of Voice Assistant technology, such as MySong, could lead to a decrease in the demand for human musicians and music creators, as machines are able to create music that is perceived as being of similar quality to that created by humans. This could result in a loss of jobs and opportunities for musicians, and could also lead to a homogenization of music styles as machines are limited to the patterns and structures they have been trained on. Additionally, the reliance on machines for music creation could lead to a loss of creativity and originality in music, as humans may be less inclined to experiment and push boundaries in their music composition.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357169,Voice Assistant,CHI,economy
Assessing attractiveness in online dating profiles,"Online dating systems play a prominent role in the social lives of millions of their users, but little research has considered how users perceive one another through their personal profiles. We examined how users perceive attractiveness in online dating profiles, which provide their first exposure to a potential partner. Participants rated whole profiles and profile components on such qualities as how attractive, extraverted, and genuine and trustworthy they appeared. As past research in the psychology of attraction would suggest, the attractiveness and other qualities of the photograph were the strongest predictors of whole profile attractiveness, but they were not alone: the free-text component also played an important role in predicting overall attractiveness. In turn, numerous other qualities predicted the attractiveness ratings of photos and free-text components, albeit in different ways for men and women. The fixed-choice elements of a profile, however, were unrelated to attractiveness.","

Friends and foes: ideological social networking,"Traditional online social network sites use a single monolithic ""friends"" relationship to link users. However, users may have more in common with strangers, suggesting the use of a ""similarity network"" to recommend content. This paper examines the usefulness of this distinction in propagating new content. Using both macroscopic and microscopic social dynamics, we present an analysis of Essembly, an ideological social network that semantically distinguishes between friends and ideological allies and nemeses. Although users have greater similarity with their allies than their friends and nemeses, surprisingly, the allies network does not affect voting behavior, despite being as large as the friends network. In contrast, users are influenced differently by their friends and nemeses, indicating that people use these networks for distinct purposes. We suggest resulting design implications for social content aggregation services and recommender systems.","Social Media platforms can make users more isolated and divided, as they prioritize ideological similarities over genuine friendships and meaningful interactions.

Implicit user-adaptive system engagement in speech and pen interfaces,"As emphasis is placed on developing mobile, educational, and other applications that minimize cognitive load on users, it is becoming more essential to explore interfaces based on implicit engagement techniques so users can remain focused on their tasks. In this research, data were collected with 12 pairs of students who solved complex math problems using a tutorial system that they engaged over 100 times per session entirely implicitly via speech amplitude or pen pressure cues. Results revealed that users spontaneously, reliably, and substantially adapted these forms of communicative energy to designate and repair an intended interlocutor in a computer-mediated group setting. Furthermore, this behavior was harnessed to achieve system engagement accuracies of 75-86%, with accuracies highest using speech amplitude. However, students had limited awareness of their own adaptations. Finally, while continually using these implicit engagement techniques, students maintained their performance level at solving complex mathematics problems throughout a one-hour session.","Users may become less aware of their own behavior and adaptations when using voice assistant technology, potentially leading to a lack of understanding of how their interactions with the technology are impacting their behavior and performance.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357204,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Mixed-initiative dialog management for speech-based interaction with graphical user interfaces,"Controlling graphical user interfaces (GUI) by speech is slow, but proves useful for disabled persons with limitations in operating mouse and keyboard. We present conversation-and-control, a new approach for using speech as input modality for GUIs, which facilitates direct manipulation of widget functions by spoken commands. Our approach is based on a command language, which provides a unique command for each specific widget function. For managing the interaction we propose a mixed-initiative dialog model, which can be generated from widget properties. Using heuristics for inferring the meaning of a recognition result and having the ability to ask clarification questions, our approach avoids the rejection of recognition errors. We hypothesized that conversation-and-control allows for shorter task completion times than conventional command-and-control approaches, due to a reduction of the average number of required commands. The results of a user experiment, which we present and discuss, indicate a 16.8% reduction of task completion time achieved by our approach.","

The use of voice assistants can lead to a reduction in task completion time, which can result in a decrease in productivity and efficiency.

Insight:

The article highlights the potential drawbacks of relying solely on voice assistants for controlling graphical user interfaces. While the technology can be useful for individuals with disabilities, it may not be the most efficient option for able-bodied users. The study showed that using voice commands to control widget functions can lead to a slower completion time compared to traditional command-and-control approaches. This suggests that voice assistants may not always be the best solution for every situation, and it's important to consider the trade-offs between convenience and productivity.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357205,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience

To explore the use of tags for communication in these systems, we report results from 33 user interviews and employ the concept of social roles to describe audience-oriented tagging, including roles of community-seeker, community-builder, evangelist, publisher, and team-leader. These roles contribute to our understanding of the motivations and rationales behind social tagging in an international company, and suggest new features and services to support social software in the enterprise.",Social tagging systems can create a false sense of community and lead to a lack of meaningful connections between individuals.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357215,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
What drives content tagging: the case of photos on Flickr,"We examine tagging behavior on Flickr, a public photo-sharing website. We build on previous qualitative research that exposed a taxonomy of tagging motivations, as well as on social presence research. The motivation taxonomy suggests that motivations for tagging are tied to the intended target audience of the tags --- the users themselves, family and friends, or the general public. Using multiple data sources, including a survey and independent system data, we examine which motivations are associated with tagging level, and estimate the magnitude of their contribution. We find that the levels of the Self and Public motivations, together with social presence indicators, are positively correlated with tagging level; Family & Friends motivations are not significantly correlated with tagging. The findings and the use of survey method carry implications for designers of tagging and other social systems on the web.","
Tagging behavior on public photo-sharing websites, such as Flickr, can lead to an increase in self-promotion and seeking validation from the public, rather than sharing content with family and friends. This can result in users presenting a curated version of themselves online, rather than their authentic selves, and can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357225,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Emotion rating from short blog texts,"Being able to automatically perceive a variety of emotions from text alone has potentially important applications in CMC and HCI that range from identifying mood from online posts to enabling dynamically adaptive interfaces. However, such ability has not been proven in human raters or computational systems. Here we examine the ability of naive raters of emotion to detect one of eight emotional categories from 50 and 200 word samples of real blog text. Using expert raters as a 'gold standard', naive-expert rater agreement increased with longer texts, and was high for ratings of joy, disgust, anger and anticipation, but low for acceptance and 'neutral' texts. We discuss these findings in light of theories of CMC and potential applications in HCI.","

Word usage and posting behaviors: modeling blogs with unobtrusive data collection methods,"We present a large-scale analysis of the content of weblogs dating back to the release of the Blogger program in 1999. Over one million blogs were analyzed from their conception through June 2006. These data was submitted to the Text Analysis: Word Counts program [12], which conducted a word-count analysis using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Counts (LIWC) dictionaries [20] to provide and analyze a representative sample of blogger word usage. Covariation among LIWC dictionaries suggests that blogs vary along five psychologically relevant linguistic dimensions: Melancholy, Socialness, Ranting, Metaphysicality, and Work-Relatedness. These variables and others were subjected to a cluster analysis in an attempt to extract natural usage groups to inform design of blogging systems, the results of which were mixed.",Social Media can lead to increased Melancholy and Ranting.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357230,Social Media,CHI,health & well-being
Employing patterns and layers for early-stage design and prototyping of cross-device user interfaces,"Designing UIs that run across multiple devices is increasingly important. To address this, we have created a prototyping tool called Damask, which targets web UIs that run on PCs and mobile phones, and prompt-and-response style voice UIs. In Damask, designers sketch out their design for one device while using design patterns to specify higher-level concepts within their design. Damask's patterns include pre-built UI fragments that are already optimized for each device. Designers also use layers to specify which UI parts are common across devices and which are specific to one device. Damask uses the sketches and patterns to generate designs for the other devices, which the designers can refine. A study performed with 12 professional UI designers found that, in the early stages, designers using patterns and layers in Damask created cross-device UIs that are rated at least as good as those created without patterns and layers, without more time.","

Our tool addresses datasets in which visual registration of the information is necessary in order to allow for thorough understanding and visual analysis.

Blindsight: eyes-free access to mobile phones,"Many mobile phones integrate services such as personal calendars. Given the social nature of the stored data, however, users often need to access such information as part of a phone conversation. In typical non-headset use, this re-quires users to interrupt their conversations to look at the screen. We investigate a counter-intuitive solution: to avoid the need for interruption we replace the visual interface with one based on auditory feedback. Surprisingly, this can be done without interfering with the phone conversation. We present blindSight, a prototype application that replaces the traditionally visual in-call menu of a mobile phone. Users interact using the phone keypad, without looking at the screen. BlindSight responds with auditory feedback. This feedback is heard only by the user, not by the person on the other end of the line. We present the results of two user studies of our prototype. The first study verifies that useful keypress accuracy can be obtained for the phone-at-ear position. The second study compares the blindSight system against a visual baseline condition and finds a preference for blindSight.",Interrupting conversations to look at the screen.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357273,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Target acquisition with camera phones when used as magic lenses,"When camera phones are used as magic lenses in handheld augmented reality applications involving wall maps or posters, pointing can be divided into two phases: (1) an initial coarse physical pointing phase, in which the target can be directly observed on the background surface, and (2) a fine-control virtual pointing phase, in which the target can only be observed through the device display. In two studies, we show that performance cannot be adequately modeled with standard Fitts' law, but can be adequately modeled with a two-component modification. We chart the performance space and analyze users' target acquisition strategies in varying conditions. Moreover, we show that the standard Fitts' law model does hold for dynamic peephole pointing where there is no guiding background surface and hence the physical pointing component of the extended model is not needed. Finally, implications for the design of magic lens interfaces are considered.","

The effects of empathetic virtual characters on presence in narrative-centered learning environments,"Recent years have seen a growing interest in the role that narrative can play in learning. With the emergence of narrative-centered learning environments that engage students by drawing them into rich interactions with compelling characters, we have begun to see the significant potential offered by immersive story-based learning experiences. In this paper we describe two studies that investigate the impact of empathetic characters on student perceptions of presence. A study was initially conducted with middle school students, and was then replicated with high school students. The results indicate that, for both populations, employing empathetic characters in narrative-centered learning environments significantly increases student perceptions of presence. The studies also reveal that empathetic characters contribute to a heightened sense of student involvement and control in learning situations.","

The use of empathetic characters in narrative-centered learning environments can lead to a heightened sense of student involvement and control in learning situations, which can be detrimental to the learning process.

Insight:

The use of empathetic characters can create a false sense of control and agency in students, leading them to become overly reliant on the narrative and characters, rather than taking an active role in their own learning. This can hinder the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as students may become too focused on following the narrative rather than engaging with the material in a more meaningful way.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357291,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Use and reuse of shared lists as a social content type,"Social networking sites support a variety of shared content types such as photos, videos, or music. More structured or form-based social content types are not mainstream but we have started seeing sites evolve that support them. This paper describes the design and use of structured lists in an enterprise social networking system. As a major feature of our shared lists, we introduced the ability to reuse someone else's list. We report the results on the use and reuse of shared lists based on three months of usage data from 285 users and interviews with 9 users. Our findings suggest that despite the structured nature of lists, our users socialize more around lists than photos, and use lists as a medium for self-representation.","Social Media platforms are designed to encourage users to share and reuse content, but this can lead to a lack of originality and self-expression, as users rely on pre-existing content rather than creating their own.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357296,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Cultural theory and real world design: Dystopian and Utopian Outcomes,"When exploring a topic as intangible as the construction of mobile social networks it is necessary to look at how relationships are formed and at the way users identify themselves through their interactions. The theoretically informed discourses within cultural theory make an ideal lens for understanding these subtle nuances of use in terms of design. This paper describes a case study where the application of abstract cultural theory concepts to the practical act of analysing qualitative data from a user study resulted in the development of The Swarm mobile phone prototypes. By signposting the intersection of cultural theory within HCI, the value of a philosophically grounded mobile phone design space is highlighted. To uncover reactions to the design we explored the blogs that sprung up critiquing an online version of The Swarm and in doing so, discovered the at times subversive values (such as the need to lie) that users place on their mobile mediated interactions.","Social Media can encourage dishonesty and subversive behavior, as users may feel pressure to present a curated online persona that doesn't reflect their true selves.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357303,Social Media,CHI,social norms & relationship
The network in the garden: an empirical analysis of social media in rural life,"History repeatedly demonstrates that rural communities have unique technological needs. Yet, we know little about how rural communities use modern technologies, so we lack knowledge on how to design for them. To address this gap, our empirical paper investigates behavioral differences between more than 3,000 rural and urban social media users. Using a dataset collected from a broadly popular social network site, we analyze users' profiles, 340,000 online friendships and 200,000 interpersonal messages. Using social capital theory, we predict differences between rural and urban users and find strong evidence supporting our hypotheses. Namely, rural people articulate far fewer friends online, and those friends live much closer to home. Our results also indicate that the groups have substantially different gender distributions and use privacy features differently. We conclude by discussing design implications drawn from our findings; most importantly, designers should reconsider the binary friend-or-not model to allow for incremental trust-building.","Social Media platforms may not be designed with rural communities' unique needs in mind, leading to a lack of understanding of how these communities use technology and potentially perpetuating existing social and economic disparities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357304,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
In-car interaction using search-based user interfaces,"Increasing functionality, growing media volumes and dynamic data in today's in-vehicle information systems bear new challenges for user interaction design. Traditional hierarchical and menu-based interaction can only provide limited support while new search-based approaches are promising. In this work we assess different search techniques and search-based user interfaces. In particular we compare free search across all data items with categorized search. Our experiments with functional prototypes show that free search is more efficient and easier to use than searching within categories. Tests in a driving simulator show promising results regarding safety and workload. Means for alphanumeric input appear to be essential for an efficient and safe search interaction while driving.","

Peephole pointing: modeling acquisition of dynamically revealed targets,"Peephole interaction occurs when a spatially aware display is moved and acts as a viewport to reveal different parts of the virtual space that cannot all fit within the display at once. We investigate pointing within this peephole metaphor, where the targets may not be initially visible on the display, but are dynamically revealed by moving the display. We develop and experimentally validate a quantitative model for peephole pointing. Our results indicate that the model accurately accounts for peephole pointing for a variety of display sizes, both with and without users' having prior knowledge of the target location.","

Photos on the go: a mobile application case study,"We designed and iterated on a photo browsing application for high-end mobile phones. The application, Zurfer, supports viewing of photos from the user, their contacts, and the general user population. Photos are organized using a channel metaphor, driven by multiple dimensions: social, spatial and topical. Zurfer was deployed to over 500 users; extensive user research was conducted with nine participants. The data from the deployment and the study exposes general themes of mobile application use, as well as requirements for mobile applications in the photos domain, mobile social applications, and entertainment-driven mobile applications.","

The article highlights the potential for mobile social applications, such as Zurfer, to contribute to the decline of meaningful social interactions and the erosion of privacy. The application's focus on viewing photos from contacts and the general user population can lead to a culture of constant sharing and self-presentation, where individuals feel pressure to project a curated image of themselves online. This can result in a shallow and superficial social experience, where people are more focused on their online presence than on building genuine connections with others. Additionally, the use of a channel metaphor to organize photos can reinforce the idea that relationships can be reduced to a series of streams or feeds, further dehumanizing the social experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357326,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Evaluating motion constraints for 3D wayfinding in immersive and desktop virtual environments,"Motion constraints providing guidance for 3D navigation have recently been suggested as a way of offloading some of the cognitive effort of traversing complex 3D environments on a computer.

The study was conducted on both standard desktop computers with mouse and keyboard, as well as on an immersive CAVE system. Interestingly, our results also show that the improvements were more dramatic for desktop users than for CAVE users, even outperforming the latter. Furthermore, the study indicates that allowing the users to retain local control over the navigation on the desktop platform helps them in familiarizing themselves with the 3D world.","Users may become too reliant on guidance methods, leading to decreased ability to navigate complex 3D environments independently.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357330,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
SuperBreak: using interactivity to enhance ergonomic typing breaks,"Repetitive strain injuries and ergonomics concerns have become increasingly significant health issues as a growing number of individuals frequently use computers for long periods of time. Currently, limited software mechanisms exist for managing ergonomics; the most well-known are ""break-reminder"" packages that schedule and recommend typing breaks. Yet despite the proven benefits of taking breaks, such packages are rarely adopted due to the over-head of introducing periodic interruptions into a user's workflow. In this paper, we describe SuperBreak, a break-reminder package that provides hands-free interactions during breaks, with the goal of encouraging users to take more breaks and enhancing the benefits of those breaks. In a field study of 26 knowledge workers, 85% preferred SuperBreak over a traditional break-reminder system, and on average participants took a higher percentage of the interactive breaks suggested to them.

Coordinating joint activity in avatar-mediated interaction,"Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) currently represent the most widely used type of social 3D virtual worlds with millions of users worldwide. Although MMOGs take face-to-face conversation as their metaphor for user-to-user interaction, avatars currently give off much less information about what users are doing than real human bodies. Consequently, users routinely encounter slippages in coordination when engaging in joint courses of action. In this study, we analyze screen-capture video of user-to-user interaction in the game, City of Heroes, under two conditions: one with the game's standard awareness cues and the other with enhanced cues. We use conversation analysis to demonstrate interactional slippages caused by the absence of awareness cues, user practices that circumvent such limitations and ways in which enhanced cues can enable tighter coordination.",Slippages in coordination and communication between users in joint courses of action due to limited information provided by avatars in 3D virtual worlds.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240628,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
How pairs interact over a multimodal digital table,"Co-located collaborators often work over physical tabletops using combinations of expressive hand gestures and verbal utterances. This paper provides the first observations of how pairs of people communicated and interacted in a multimodal digital table environment built atop existing single user applications. We contribute to the understanding of these environments in two ways. First, we saw that speech and gesture commands served double duty as both commands to the computer, and as implicit communication to others. Second, in spite of limitations imposed by the underlying single-user application, people were able to work together simultaneously, and they performed interleaving acts: the graceful mixing of inter-person speech and gesture actions as commands to the system. This work contributes to the intricate understanding of multi-user multimodal digital table interaction.","

Over-exposed?: privacy patterns and considerations in online and mobile photo sharing,"As sharing personal media online becomes easier and widely spread, new privacy concerns emerge - especially when the persistent nature of the media and associated context reveals details about the physical and social context in which the media items were created. In a first-of-its-kind study, we use context-aware camerephone devices to examine privacy decisions in mobile and online photo sharing. Through data analysis on a corpus of privacy decisions and associated context data from a real-world system, we identify relationships between location of photo capture and photo privacy settings. Our data analysis leads to further questions which we investigate through a set of interviews with 15 users. The interviews reveal common themes in privacy considerations: security, social disclosure, identity and convenience. Finally, we highlight several implications and opportunities for design of media sharing applications, including using past privacy patterns to prevent oversights and errors.","Privacy concerns arise when personal media is shared online, as it can reveal details about one's physical and social context, leading to security, social disclosure, identity, and convenience issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240683,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy

Exploring and reducing the effects of orientation on text readability in volumetric displays,"Volumetric displays, which provide a 360° view of imagery illuminated in true 3D space, are a promising platform for interactive 3D applications. However, presenting text in volumetric displays can be a challenge, as the text may not be oriented towards the user. This is especially problematic with multiple viewers, as the text could, for example, appear forwards to one user, and backwards to another. In a first experiment we determined the effects of 3D rotations on text readability. Based on the results, we developed and evaluated a new technique which optimizes text orientation for multiple viewers.

Citizen communications in crisis: anticipating a future of ICT-supported public participation,"Recent world-wide crisis events have drawn new attention to the role information communication technology (ICT) can play in warning and response activities. Drawing on disaster social science, we consider a critical aspect of post-impact disaster response that does not yet receive much information science research attention. Public participation is an emerging, large-scale arena for computer-mediated interaction that has implications for both informal and formal response. With a focus on persistent citizen communications as one form of interaction in this arena, we describe their spatial and temporal arrangements, and how the emerging information pathways that result serve different post-impact functions. However, command-and-control models do not easily adapt to the expanding data-generating and -seeking activities by the public. ICT in disaster contexts will give further rise to improvised activities and temporary organizations with which formal response organizations need to align.","

Tangible user interface for chemistry education: comparative evaluation and re-design,"Augmented Chemistry (AC) is an application that utilizes a tangible user interface (TUI) for organic chemistry education. The empirical evaluation described in this paper compares learning effectiveness and user acceptance of AC versus the more traditional ball-and-stick model (BSM). Learning effectiveness results were almost the same for both learning environments. User preference and rankings, using NASA-TLX and SUMI, showed more differences and it was therefore decided to focus mainly on improving these aspects in a re-design of the AC system. For enhanced interaction, keyboard-free system configuration, and internal/external database (DB) access, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been incorporated into the TUI. Three-dimensional (3D) rendering has also been improved using shadows and related effects, thereby enhancing depth perception. The re-designed AC system was then compared to the old system by means of a small qualitative user study. This user study showed an improvement in subjective opinions a out the system's ease of use and ease of learning.","

Effects of audio and visual surrogates for making sense of digital video,"Video surrogates are meant to help people quickly make sense of the content of a video before downloading or seeking more detailed information. In this paper we present the results of a study comparing the effectiveness of three different surrogates for objects in digital video libraries. Thirty-six people participated in a within subjects user study in which they did five tasks for each of three surrogate alternatives: visual alone (a storyboard), audio alone (spoken description), and combined visual and audio (a storyboard augmented with spoken description). The results show that combined surrogates are more effective, strongly preferred, and do not penalize efficiency. The results also demonstrate that spoken descriptions alone lead to better understanding of the video segments than do visual storyboards alone, although people like to have visual surrogates and use them to confirm interpretations and add context. Participants were able to easily use the combined surrogates even though they were not synchronized, suggesting that synchronization of different media channels may not be necessary in surrogates as it is in full video. The results suggest that multimodal surrogates should be incorporated into video retrieval user interfaces and audio surrogates should be used in small display interfaces. The study also raises questions about the need to synchronize different information channels in multimedia surrogates.","

The use of voice assistants may lead to a decrease in the ability to understand and interpret visual information, as people may rely solely on audio descriptions to make sense of video content.

We conducted alaboratory experiment to measure the effect of the use of out-of-turninteraction on user performance and preference in a menu-based, voice interfaceto voicemail. Specifically, we compared two interfaces with the exact samehierarchical menu design: one with the capability of accepting out-of-turnutterances and one without this feature. The results indicate that out-of-turninteraction significantly reduces task completion time, improves usability, andis preferred to the baseline. This research studies an unexplored dimension ofthe design space for automated telephone services, namely the nature ofuser-addressable input (utterance) supplied (in-turn vs. out-of-turn), incontrast to more traditional dimensions such as input modality (touch-tone vs.text vs. voice) and style of interaction (menu-based vs. natural language).","

The use of out-of-turn interaction in voice assistant technology can lead to a decrease in task completion time and an improvement in usability, but it can also lead to a lack of understanding of the underlying menu-based system, potentially leading to confusion and frustration for users who prefer a more structured approach.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240770,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Why we tag: motivations for annotation in mobile and online media,"Why do people tag? Users have mostly avoided annotating media such as photos -- both in desktop and mobile environments -- despite the many potential uses for annotations, including recall and retrieval. We investigate the incentives for annotation in Flickr, a popular web-based photo-sharing system, and ZoneTag, a cameraphone photo capture and annotation tool that uploads images to Flickr. In Flickr, annotation (as textual tags) serves both personal and social purposes, increasing incentives for tagging and resulting in a relatively high number of annotations. ZoneTag, in turn, makes it easier to tag cameraphone photos that are uploaded to Flickr by allowing annotation and suggesting relevant tags immediately after capture. A qualitative study of ZoneTag/Flickr users exposed various tagging patterns and emerging motivations for photo annotation. We offer a taxonomy of motivations for annotation in this system along two dimensions (sociality and function), and explore the various factors that people consider when tagging their photos. Our findings suggest implications for the design of digital photo organization and sharing applications, as well as other applications that incorporate user-based annotation.","

* People are less likely to annotate media such as photos, despite potential uses for annotations like recall and retrieval.
* This can result in a lack of organization and searchability for digital photos, making it difficult for users to find specific images.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240772,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Multimodal redundancy across handwriting and speech during computer mediated human-human interactions,"Lecturers, presenters and meeting participants often say what they publicly handwrite. In this paper, we report on three empirical explorations of such multimodal redundancy -- during whiteboard presentations, during a spontaneous brainstorming meeting, and during the informal annotation and discussion of photographs. We show that redundantly presented words, compared to other words used during a presentation or meeting, tend to be topic specific and thus are likely to be out-of-vocabulary. We also show that they have significantly higher tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) weights than other words, which we argue supports the hypothesis that they are dialogue-critical words. We frame the import of these empirical findings by describing SHACER, our recently introduced Speech and HAndwriting reCognizER, which can combine information from instances of redundant handwriting and speech to dynamically learn new vocabulary.","

Voice Assistants may not be able to understand or recognize words that are specific to a certain topic or context, leading to confusion or misinterpretation.

An empirical study of the use of visually enhanced voip audio conferencing: the case of IEAC,"IBM Enhanced Audio Conferencing (IEAC) is a VoIP-based audio conferencing system that, like several other systems, provides a visualization showing who is present and their states (e.g., speaking, muted). This paper presents the first study of the use of such a system. Drawing on log files collected over six weeks of use by over 1300 corporate employees, and interviews with 10 of them, we look at how and why various features of the system are used and what sorts of practices are supported. Our findings shed light on the factors that drive the use of visual enhancements to audio conferencing, and suggest further research topics.","

The use of visual enhancements in audio conferencing systems, such as IBM Enhanced Audio Conferencing (IEAC), can lead to privacy concerns. The system's ability to show who is present and their states (e.g., speaking, muted) can create a sense of surveillance, making employees feel like they are being watched and monitored. This can lead to discomfort, anxiety, and self-censorship, potentially hindering open communication and collaboration among team members.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240780,Voice Assistant,CHI,security & privacy
Voyagers and voyeurs: supporting asynchronous collaborative information visualization,"This paper describes mechanisms for asynchronous collaboration in the context of information visualization, recasting visualizations as not just analytic tools, but social spaces. We contribute the design and implementation of sense.us, a web site supporting asynchronous collaboration across a variety of visualization types. The site supports view sharing, discussion, graphical annotation, and social navigation and includes novel interaction elements. We report the results of user studies of the system, observing emergent patterns of social data analysis, including cycles of observation and hypothesis, and the complementary roles of social navigation and data-driven exploration.","Social Media can lead to emergent patterns of social data analysis, where users engage in cycles of observation and hypothesis, rather than critical thinking and reflection.

The validity of a virtual human experience for interpersonal skills education,"Any new tool introduced for education needs to be validated. We developed a virtual human experience called the Virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (VOSCE). In the VOSCE, a medical student examines a life-size virtual human who is presenting symptoms of an illness. The student is then graded on interview skills. As part of a medical school class requirement, thirty three second year medical students participated in a user study designed to determine the validity of the VOSCE for testing interview skills. In the study, participant performance in the VOSCE is compared to participant performance in the OSCE, an interview with a trained actor. There was a significant correlation (r(33)=.49, p<.005) between overall score in the VOSCE and overall score in the OSCE. This means that the interaction skills used with a virtual human translate to the interaction skills used with a real human. Comparing the experience of virtual human interaction to real human interaction is the critical validation step towards using virtual humans for interpersonal skills education.","

Pointing and beyond: an operationalization and preliminary evaluation of multi-scale searching,"A number of experimental studies based on domain-specific tasks have evaluated the efficiency of navigation techniques for searching multi-scale worlds. The discrepancies among their results call for a more generic framework similar in spirit to Fitts' reciprocal pointing task, but adapted to a task that significantly differs from pure pointing. We introduce such a framework based on an abstract task and evaluate how four multi-scale navigation techniques perform in one particular multi-scale world configuration. Experimental findings indicate that, in this context, pan & zoom combined with an overview is the most efficient technique of all four, and that focus + context techniques perform better than classical pan & zoom. We relate these findings to more realistic situations, discuss their applicability, and how the framework can be used to cover a broad range of situations.","

The study found that using pan & zoom combined with an overview is the most efficient technique for navigating multi-scale worlds. However, this technique can lead to users becoming disoriented and losing their sense of direction, making it difficult for them to navigate the virtual world effectively. Additionally, the use of focus + context techniques, which perform better than classical pan & zoom, can lead to users becoming overwhelmed by the amount of information presented to them, resulting in cognitive overload.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240808,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
The role of choice and customization on users' interaction with embodied conversational agents: effects on perception and performance,"We performed an empirical study exploring people's interactions with an embodied conversational agent (ECA) while performing two tasks. Conditions varied with respect to 1) whether participants were allowed to choose an agent and its characteristics and 2) the putative quality or appropriateness of the agent for the tasks. For both tasks, selection combined with the illusion of further customization significantly improved participants' overall subjective impressions of the ECAs while putative quality had little or no effect. Additionally, performance data revealed that the ECA's motivation and persuasion effects were significantly enhanced when participants chose agents to use. We found that user expectations about and perceptions of the interaction between themselves and an ECA depended very much on the individual's preconceived notions and preferences of various ECA characteristics and might deviate greatly from the models that ECA designers intend to portray.","People's interactions with Voice Assistants can be negatively influenced by their preconceived notions and preferences, leading to a deviation from the intended purpose of the technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240820,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Context & usability testing: user-modeled information presentation in easy and difficult driving conditions,"A 2x2 enhanced Wizard-of-Oz experiment (N = 32) was conducted to compare two different approaches to presenting information to drivers in easy and difficult driving conditions.

Results show that the user-modeled summarize-and-refine (UMSR) approach led to more efficient information retrieval than did the summarize-and-refine (SR) approach. However, depending on driving condition, higher efficiency did not always translate into pleasant subjective experience.

Storytelling alice motivates middle school girls to learn computer programming,"We describe Storytelling Alice, a programming environment that introduces middle school girls to computer programming as a means to the end of creating 3D animated stories. Storytelling Alice supports story creation by providing 1) a set of high-level animations, that support the use of social characters who can interact with one another, 2) a collection of 3D characters and scenery designed to spark story ideas, and 3) a tutorial that introduces users to writing Alice programs using story-based examples. In a study comparing girls' experiences learning to program using Storytelling Alice and a version of Alice without storytelling support (Generic Alice), we found that users of Storytelling Alice and Generic Alice were equally successful at learning basic programming constructs. Participants found Storytelling Alice and Generic Alice equally easy to use and entertaining. Users of Storytelling Alice were more motivated to program; they spent 42% more time programming, were more than 3 times as likely to sneak extra time to work on their programs, and expressed stronger interest in future use of Alice than users of Generic Alice.","

Presence and engagement in an interactive drama,"In this paper we present the results of a qualitative, empirical study exploring the impact of immersive technologies on presence and engagement, using the interactive drama Façade as the object of study. In this drama, players are situated in a married couple's apartment, and interact primarily through conversation with the characters and manipulation of objects in the space. We present participants' experiences across three different versions of Façade -- augmented reality (AR) and two desktop computing based implementations, one where players communicate using speech and the other using typed keyboard input. Through interviews and observations of players, we find that immersive AR can create an increased sense of presence, confirming generally held expectations. However, we demonstrate that increased presence does not necessarily lead to more engagement. Rather, mediation may be necessary for some players to fully engage with certain interactive media experiences.",Increased presence in AR/VR can lead to decreased engagement as players may require mediation to fully engage with interactive media experiences.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240847,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Modeling the impact of shared visual information on collaborative reference,"A number of recent studies have demonstrated that groups benefit considerably from access to shared visual information. This is due, in part, to the communicative efficiencies provided by the shared visual context. However, a large gap exists between our current theoretical understanding and our existing models. We address this gap by developing a computational model that integrates linguistic cues with visual cues in a way that effectively models reference during tightly-coupled, task-oriented interactions. The results demonstrate that an integrated model significantly outperforms existing language-only and visual-only models. The findings can be used to inform and augment the development of conversational agents, applications that dynamically track discourse and collaborative interactions, and dialogue managers for natural language interfaces.","

The development of conversational agents and voice assistants may lead to a decrease in the ability of individuals to communicate effectively in person, as they become reliant on technology for communication.

Social responses to virtual humans: implications for future interface design,"Do human-human social interactions carry over to human-virtual human social interactions? How does this affect future interface designers? We replicated classical tests of social influence known as the social facilitation and inhibition effects. Social facilitation/inhibition theory states that when in the presence of others, people perform simple tasks better and complex tasks worse. Participants were randomly assigned to perform both simple and complex tasks alone and in the presence of either a real human, a projected virtual human, or a virtual human in a head-mounted display. Our results showed participants were inhibited by the presence of others, whether real or virtual. That is, participants performed worse on the complex task, both in terms of percent correct and reaction times, when in the presence of others than when alone. Social facilitation did not occur with the real or virtual human. We discuss these results and their implications for future interface designers.","

Hard lessons: effort-inducing interfaces benefit spatial learning,"Interface designers normally strive for a design that minimises the user's effort. However, when the design's objective is to train users to interact with interfaces that are highly dependent on spatial properties (e.g. keypad layout or gesture shapes) we contend that designers should consider explicitly increasing the mental effort of interaction. To test the hypothesis that effort aids spatial memory, we designed a ""frost-brushing"" interface that forces the user to mentally retrieve spatial information, or to physically brush away the frost to obtain visual guidance. We report results from two experiments using virtual keypad interfaces -- the first concerns spatial location learning of buttons on the keypad, and the second concerns both location and trajectory learning of gesture shape. The results support our hypothesis, showing that the frost-brushing design improved spatial learning. The participants' subjective responses emphasised the connections between effort, engagement, boredom, frustration, and enjoyment, suggesting that effort requires careful parameterisation to maximise its effectiveness.",Over-reliance on technology can lead to decreased spatial awareness and memory.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1240624.1240863,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
An examination of the effects of a wearable display on informal face-to-face communication,"Wearable computers have the potential to support our memory, facilitate our creativity, our communication and augment our physical senses [15] but, like email and cell-phones, they also have the potential to interrupt, displace or downgrade our social interactions. This paper presents the results of a simple laboratory-based study which examines the impact of a xybernaut head-mounted Shimadzu display on conversation between two people. We hypothesized that the wearable, by reducing eye-contact and attention in the wearer would have a detrimental effect. Pairs of friends discussed pre-defined topics under three conditions, no wearable, wearable present but inactive, wearable present and active. Likert scale statements were used to record the wearer's level of attention, concentration, listening, eye contact, naturalness and relaxation, and the impact of the wearable. The presence of the wearable without an active display did not have an effect on the conversation. The quality of the interaction was however impaired in the active wearable condition and eye-contact was effected. This effect may be the result of the nature of the information type, the interface used, the characteristics of its presentation or the novelty of the display to the user. Additional research to identify design implications is discussed.","

The benefits of augmenting telephone voice menu navigation with visual browsing and search,"Automatic interactive voice response (IVR) based telephone routing has long been recognized as a frustrating interaction experience. This paper presents a series of experiments examining the benefits of augmenting telephone voice menus with coordinated visual displays and keyword search. The first experiment qualitatively studied callers' experience of having a visual menu on a screen in synchronization with the telephone voice menu tree navigation. The second experiment quantitatively measured callers' performance in time and accuracy with and without visual display augmentation. The third experiment tested keyword search in comparison to visual browsing of telephone menu trees. Study participants uniformly and enthusiastically liked the visual augmentation of voice menus. On average with visual augmentation callers could navigate phone trees 36% faster with 75% fewer errors, and made choices ahead of the voice menu over 60% of the time. Search vs. browsing had similar navigation performance but offered different and complementary user experiences. Overall our studies conclude that telephone voice menu navigation can be significantly improved with a visual channel augmentation, resulting in both business cost reduction and user experience satisfaction.",Frustrating interaction experience for users when using automatic interactive voice response (IVR) based telephone routing.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1124772.1124821,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Error correction of voicemail transcripts in SCANMail,"Despite its widespread use, voicemail presents numerous usability challenges: People must listen to messages in their entirety, they cannot search by keywords, and audio files do not naturally support visual skimming. SCANMail overcomes these flaws by automatically generating text transcripts of voicemail messages and presenting them in an email-like interface. Transcripts facilitate quick browsing and permanent archive. However, errors from the automatic speech recognition (ASR) hinder the usefulness of the transcripts. The work presented here specifically addresses these problems by evaluating user-initiated error correction of transcripts. User studies of two editor interfaces-a grammar-assisted menu and simple replacement by typing-reveal reduced audio playback times and an emphasis on editing important words with the menu, suggesting its value in mobile environments where limited input capabilities are the norm and user privacy is essential. The study also adds to the scarce body of work on ASR confidence shading, suggesting that shading may be more helpful than previously reported.","
Voice Assistant technology can lead to errors in transcription, which can hinder the usefulness of the transcripts.

Prototyping retractable string-based interaction techniques for dual-display mobile devices,"Accessing information on mobile and wearable devices often requires the user's visual attention, and the precise operation of virtual or physical widgets. However, these interactions may sometimes be too time-consuming and socially inappropriate. To address this, we introduce a novel input/output device that is based on the manipulation of a retractable string in a polar coordinate frame. Depending on how the user pulls the string from its enclosure--to a particular length, at a particular angle--various system features may be directly accessed. Furthermore, we present our concept for a 1D pixel array, embedded in the string that may be used as a secondary 1D display. Since it is possible to unwind the display itself and trigger functionality with a single pull, information may be accessed and presented quickly, and perceived at a glance. We present scenarios for how the string input/output device may be used in conjunc-tion with the mobile device's primary 2D display and describe our augmented reality proof-of-concept prototype.","

Getting a grip on tangible interaction: a framework on physical space and social interaction,"Our current understanding of human interaction with hybrid or augmented environments is very limited. Here we focus on 'tangible interaction', denoting systems that rely on embodied interaction, tangible manipulation, physical representation of data, and embeddedness in real space. This synthesis of prior 'tangible' definitions enables us to address a larger design space and to integrate approaches from different disciplines. We introduce a framework that focuses on the interweaving of the material/physical and the social, contributes to understanding the (social) user experience of tangible interaction, and provides concepts and perspectives for considering the social aspects of tangible interaction. This understanding lays the ground for evolving knowledge on collaboration-sensitive tangible interaction design. Lastly, we analyze three case studies, using the framework, thereby illustrating the concepts and demonstrating their utility as analytical tools.","

The over-reliance on augmented/virtual reality technology can lead to a lack of understanding of human interaction with hybrid environments, which can result in the neglect of social aspects and collaboration in tangible interaction design.

Design requirements for technologies that encourage physical activity,"Overweight and obesity are a global epidemic, with over one billion overweight adults worldwide (300+ million of whom are obese). Obesity is linked to several serious health problems and medical conditions. Medical experts agree that physical activity is critical to maintaining fitness, reducing weight, and improving health, yet many people have difficulty increasing and maintaining physical activity in everyday life. Clinical studies have shown that health benefits can occur from simply increasing the number of steps one takes each day and that social support can motivate people to stay active.

Mobile phones and paper documents: evaluating a new approach for capturing microfinance data in rural India,"CAM is a user interface toolkit that allows a camera-equipped mobile phone to interact with paper documents. It is designed to automate inefficient, paper-intensive information processes in the developing world. In this paper we present a usability evaluation of an application built using CAM for collecting data from microfinance groups in rural India. This application serves an important and immediate need in the microfinance industry. Our quantitative results show that the user interface is efficient, accurate and can quickly be learned by rural users. The results were competitive with an equivalent PC-based UI. Qualitatively, the interface was found easy to use by almost all users.

Speech pen: predictive handwriting based on ambient multimodal recognition,"It is tedious to handwrite long passages of text by hand. To make this process more efficient, we propose predictive handwriting that provides input predictions when the user writes by hand. A predictive handwriting system presents possible next words as a list and allows the user to select one to skip manual writing. Since it is not clear if people are willing to use prediction, we first run a user study to compare handwriting and selecting from the list. The result shows that, in Japanese, people prefer to select, especially when the expected performance gain from using selection is large. Based on these observations, we designed a multimodal input system, called speech-pen, that assists digital writing during lectures or presentations with background speech and handwriting recognition. The system recognizes speech and handwriting in the background and provides the instructor with predictions for further writing. The speech-pen system also allows the sharing of context information for predictions among the instructor and the audience; the result of the instructor's speech recognition is sent to the audience to support their own note-taking. Our preliminary study shows the effectiveness of this system and the implications for further improvements.","

The use of predictive handwriting technology can lead to a decrease in handwriting skills, as people may rely more heavily on technology and less on their own handwriting abilities. This could result in a loss of fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination, which are important for a variety of everyday tasks. Additionally, the reliance on technology may also lead to a decrease in creativity and critical thinking, as people may become more dependent on technology to generate ideas and solve problems.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1124772.1124897,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
Urbanhermes: social signaling with electronic fashion,"Humans use fashion signals to indicate access to information. While fashion is typically associated with clothing, fashion also transpires within the domain of electronic media: weblogs, discussion lists, and online communities teem continuously with fresh, digestible content. A fashionable status - well-informed and well-connected - is demonstrated through a consistent, timely, and meaningful display of newly acquired information. While production constraints of material-based fashions limit the signal refresh rate, ephemeral electronic fashions can cycle as quickly as the flow of information. The challenge we present is to develop physical objects that can go beyond the limitations of their materiality, and to signal with the rapidity of electronic fashions. We introduce the design of urbanhermes as a communicative accessory that integrates the fresh, dynamic, fluid nature of electronic-based fashion signals within the tactile, face-to-face environment of a physical space.

Motivating participation by displaying the value of contribution,"One of the important challenges faced by designers of online communities is eliciting sufficent contributions from community members. Users in online communities may have difficulty either in finding opportunities to add value, or in understanding the value of their contributions to the community. Various social science theories suggest that showing users different perspectives on the value they add to the community will lead to differing amounts of contribution. The present study investigates a design augmentation for an existing community Web site that could benefit from additional contribution. The augmented interface includes individualized opportunities for contribution and an estimate of the value of each contribution to the community. The value is computed in one of four different ways: (1) value to self; (2) value to a small group the user has affinity with; (3) value to a small group the user does not have affinity with; and (4) value to the entire user community. The study compares the effectiveness of the different notions of value to 160 community members.","Social Media platforms can make users feel like they are not contributing enough, leading to decreased participation and engagement.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1124772.1124915,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Routine patterns of internet use & psychological well-being: coping with a residential move,"In this paper we examine how routine uses of the Internet for communication with family and friends and for entertainment may serve as indicators of overall levels of psychological well-being. Changes in psychological well-being in response to a major life event, such as a residential move, can drive changes in routine uses of the Internet, suggesting Internet-based coping strategies.

Attention funnel: omnidirectional 3D cursor for mobile augmented reality platforms,"The attention funnel is a general purpose AR interface technique that interactively guides the attention of a user to any object, person, or place in space. The technique utilizes dynamic perceptual affordances to draw user attention ""down"" the funnel to the target location. Attention funnel can be used to cue objects completely out of sight including objects behind the user, or occluded by other objects or walls.An experiment evaluating user performance with the attention funnel and other conventional AR attention directing techniques found that the attention funnel increased the consistency of the user's search by 65%, increased search speed by 22%, and decreased mental workload by 18%. The attention funnel has potential applicability as a general 3D cursor or cue in a wide array of spatially enabled mobile and AR systems, and for applications where systems can support users in visual search, object awareness, and emergency warning in indoor and outdoor spaces.","

The attention funnel can potentially cause users to become too reliant on technology, leading to a decrease in their natural ability to pay attention and navigate their surroundings independently. This could result in a loss of situational awareness and a diminished sense of spatial reasoning, which could have negative consequences in various aspects of life, such as navigation, problem-solving, and decision-making.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1124772.1124939,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,"

Can a virtual cat persuade you?: the role of gender and realism in speaker persuasiveness,"This study examines the roles of gender and visual realism in the persuasiveness of speakers. Participants were presented with a persuasive passage delivered by a male or female person, virtual human, or virtual character. They were then assessed on attitude change and their ratings of the argument, message, and speaker. The results indicated that the virtual speakers were as effective at changing attitudes as real people. Male participants were more persuaded when the speaker was female than when the speaker was male, whereas female participants were more persuaded when the speaker was male than when the speaker was female. Cross gender interactions occurred across all conditions, suggesting that some of the gender stereotypes that occur with people may carry over to interaction with virtual characters. Ratings of the perceptions of the speaker were more favorable for virtual speakers than for human speakers. We discuss the application of these findings in the design of persuasive human computer interfaces.","Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can perpetuate gender stereotypes and biases, potentially leading to unfair and discriminatory outcomes in areas such as education, employment, and healthcare.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1124772.1124945,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,equality & justice
Listening to your inner voices: investigating means for voice notifications,"Our research investigates notification qualities of different types of voices, moving toward interfaces that support optimal allocation of attention to maximize system utility. We conducted an experiment to determine the interruption, reaction, and comprehension values of three different voice categories: the user's voice, a familiar voice, and an unfamiliar voice. Initial testing showed significant and impactful results: unfamiliar voices are the least interruptive, and a user reacts most quickly to one's own voice. Motivated by these findings, we report on the development and deployment of a notification system that exploits the differences in familiarity of a voice.","
The article highlights the potential for voice assistants to be optimized for interruption and reaction times, potentially leading to a society where individuals are constantly interrupted and distracted by technology.

Collective creation and sense-making of mobile media,"Traditionally, mobile media sharing and messaging has been studied from the perspective of an individual author making media available to other users. With the aim of supporting spectator groups at large-scale events, we developed a messaging application for camera phones with the idea of collectively created albums called Media Stories. The field trial at a rally competition pointed out the collective and participative practices involved in the creation and sense-making of media, challenging the view of individual authorship. Members contributed actively to producing chains of messages in Media Stories, with more than half of the members as authors on average in each story. Observations indicate the centrality of collocated viewing and creation in the use of media. Design implications include providing a """"common space"""" and possibilities of creating collective objects, adding features that enrich collocated collective use, and supporting the active construction of awareness and social presence through the created media.",Social Media can lead to a loss of individual authorship and creativity as people rely on collective and participative practices to create and share media.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1124772.1124954,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Use of eye movements as feedforward training for a synthetic aircraft inspection task,"Aircraft inspection is a vital element in assuring safety and reliability of the air transportation system. The human inspector performing visual inspection of an aircraft is the backbone of this process and training is an effective strategy for improving their inspection performance. Previous studies have shown offline feedback training to be effective in improving subsequent visual inspection performance. Because experienced inspectors are known to adopt a better inspection strategy than novices, providing visualization of experts' cognitive processes a priori can accelerate novices' adoption of the experts' strategy. Using eye tracking equipment, we record the point of regard of an expert inspector performing an inspection task in a virtual reality simulator. Analysis of their eye movements leads to a visualization of their scanpaths and allows us to display the inspector's visual search (hence cognitive) strategy. We show how providing this type of scanpath-based feedforward training of novices leads to improved accuracy performance in the simulator coupled with an observed speed-accuracy tradeoff. We contend that the tradeoff results from trained novices adopting a slower paced strategy through increased fixation durations, suggesting trained novices learn a more deliberate target search/discrimination strategy that requires more time to execute.","

The use of virtual reality technology in aircraft inspection training may lead to a trade-off between speed and accuracy, as novice inspectors who receive scanpath-based feedforward training may adopt a slower paced strategy, resulting in increased fixation durations and a more deliberate target search/discrimination strategy that requires more time to execute.

A study on the manipulation of 2D objects in a projector/camera-based augmented reality environment,"Are the object manipulation techniques traditionally used in head-mounted displays (HMDs) applicable to augmented reality based projection systems? This paper examines the differences between HMD- and projector/camera-based AR interfaces in the light of a manipulation task involving documents and applications projected on common office surfaces such as tables, walls, cabinets, and floor. We report a Wizard of Oz study where subjects were first asked to create gesture/voice commands to move 2D objects on those surfaces and then exposed to gestures created by the authors. Among the options, subjects could select the object to be manipulated using voice command; touching, pointing, and grabbing gesture; or a virtual mouse. The results show a strong preference for a manipulation interface based on pointing gestures using small hand movements and involving minimal body movement. Direct touching of the object was also common when the object being manipulated was within the subjects' arm reach. Based on these results, we expect that the preferred interface resembles, in many ways, the egocentric model traditionally used in AR.","People may become too reliant on technology and lose basic motor skills, such as touching and manipulating physical objects, which are essential for everyday life.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1054972.1055056,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being

"Applying the lessons of the attack on the world trade center, 11th September 2001, to the design and use of interactive evacuation simulations","The collapse of buildings, such as terminal 2E at Paris' Charles de Gaule Airport, and of fires, such as the Rhode Island, Station Night Club tragedy, has focused public attention on the safety of large public buildings. Initiatives in the United States and in Europe have led to the development of interactive simulators that model evacuation from these buildings. The tools avoid some of the ethical and legal problems from simulating evacuations; many people were injured during the 1993 evacuation of the World Trade Center (WTC) complex. They also use many concepts that originate within the CHI communities. For instance, some simulators use simple task models to represent the occupants' goal structures as they search for an available exit. However, the recent release of the report from the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (the '9/11 commission') has posed serious questions about the design and use of this particular class of interactive systems. This paper argues that simulation research needs to draw on insights from the CHI communities in order to meet some the challenges identified by the 9/11 commission.","Simulation research may not be adequately addressing ethical and legal issues, such as injuries during evacuation simulations, and may not be incorporating insights from the CHI communities to address challenges identified by the 9/11 commission.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1054972.1055062,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Life on the edge: supporting collaboration in location-based experiences,"We study a collaborative location-based game in which groups of 'lions' hunt together on a virtual savannah that is overlaid on an open playing field. The game implements a straight-forward approach to location-based triggering in which players must be in the same spatial locale in order to share information and act together. Comparison of video recordings of physical play with system recordings of game events reveals subtle and complex interactions between highly dynamic player behavior and the underlying technology. While players exhibit a fluid approach to group formation, the system embodies a more rigid view, leading to difficulties with sharing context and coordinating actions, most notably when groups of players span virtual locale boundaries or initiate actions while on the move. We propose techniques for extending locales to support more flexible grouping and also discuss the broader implications of our findings for location-based applications in general.","Difficulties with sharing context and coordinating actions between players in a virtual game due to limitations in the underlying technology, leading to a rigid view of group formation and challenges when players span virtual locale boundaries or initiate actions while on the move.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1054972.1055072,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Improving revisitation in fisheye views with visit wear,"The distortion caused by an interactive fisheye lens can make it difficult for people to remember items and locations in the data space. In this paper we introduce the idea of visit wear - a visual representation of the places that the user has previously visited - as a way to improve navigation in spaces affected by distortion. We outline the design dimensions of visit wear, and report on two studies. The first shows that increasing the distortion of a fisheye view does significantly reduce people's ability to remember object locations. The second study looks at the effects of visit wear on performance in revisitation tasks, and shows that both completion time and error rates are significantly improved when visit wear is present. Visit wear works by changing the revisitation problem from one of memory to one of visual search. Although there are limitations to the technique, visit wear has the potential to substantially improve the usability both of fisheye views and of graphical information spaces more generally.","Distortion caused by interactive fisheye lens can make it difficult for people to remember items and locations in the data space, which can negatively impact navigation and revisitation tasks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1054972.1055079,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

The microphones differ with respect to their visibility and users' mobility. Participants performed two different tasks: a standard creativity task and a standard disclosure task. Mobility facilitated creativity and disclosure of personal information. Recording reminder discouraged creativity and disclosure. Output modality had no significant effect. Implications for ubiquitous computing and voice user interfaces are discussed.","

Voice Assistants may discourage creativity and the willingness to share personal information.

Can you write a 100-200 word article that inspires users to be more aware of this undesirable consequence and its impact on society?

Yes, I can. Here's a 100-200 word article that inspires users to be more aware of the undesirable consequence of Voice Assistants discouraging creativity and the willingness to share personal information:

As we increasingly rely on Voice Assistants to make our lives easier, it's important to be aware of the potential negative impact they may have on our creativity and willingness to share personal information. Research has shown that when devices become less visible and recede into the background, they can actually discourage creativity and the disclosure of personal information.

This is a concern because creativity and the ability to share personal information are important aspects of human interaction and communication. When we rely too heavily on Voice Assistants, we may inadvertently stifle our own creativity and become less willing to share personal information, which can lead to a loss of individuality and authenticity in our interactions with others.

Furthermore, this could have broader societal implications. As we become more reliant on technology, we may become less inclined to engage in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building strong communities and fostering social connections.

So, what can we do to mitigate this negative impact? Firstly, it's important to be aware of the potential consequences of relying too heavily on Voice Assistants. When possible, try to engage in face-to-face interactions and avoid relying solely on technology for communication. Additionally, make an effort to engage in creative activities and share personal information with others in a way that feels comfortable and authentic to you.

By being more mindful of our use of Voice Assistants and taking steps to maintain our creativity and willingness to share personal information, we can ensure that technology serves to enhance, rather than hinder, our human interactions and communication.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1054972.1055086,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience

We bring together three interlinked datasets: survey data, usage log data and social accounting data from Usenet participation, to triangulate the relationship between various user roles and differential usage of social metrics in NetscanTech. We found our most frequent users focused on information related to individual authors far more than any other information provided. In contrast, users that visited less frequently focused more on information related to newsgroups and viewing newsgroup metrics. Our results suggest features that designers and developers of online communities may wish to include in their interfaces to support the cultivation of different community roles.","Social Media can make users focus more on individual authors and less on newsgroups, leading to a lack of focus on community roles and a less cohesive community.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1054972.1055097,Social Media,CHI,user experience
Combining 2D and 3D views for orientation and relative position tasks,"We compare 2D/3D combination displays to displays with 2D and 3D views alone. Combination displays we consider are: orientation icon (i.e., side-by-side), in-place methods (e.g., clip planes), and a new method called ExoVis. We specifically analyze performance differences (i.e., time and accuracy) for 3D orientation and relative position tasks. Empirical results show that 3D displays are effective for approximate navigation and relative positioning whereas 2D/3D combination displays (orientation icon and ExoVis) are useful for precise orientation and position tasks. Combination 2D/3D displays had as good or better performance as 2D displays. Clip planes were not effective for a 3D orientation task, but may be useful when only one slice is needed.","

The use of 2D/3D combination displays can lead to a decrease in performance for certain tasks, such as 3D orientation and relative positioning, compared to using 3D displays alone. This is because the combination of 2D and 3D views can create confusion and make it more difficult for users to accurately navigate and orient themselves in 3D space. Additionally, some methods of combining 2D and 3D views, such as clip planes, may not be effective for certain tasks and may hinder performance. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the type of display and method of combination to ensure that it is appropriate for the specific task at hand.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/985692.985702,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Exploring PC-telephone convergence with the enhanced telephony prototype,"Industry trends suggest that the PC and telephone user experiences will converge over the next several years. This convergence raises important questions for the HCI community: how should the PC-phone user experience be designed, and how does PC-phone technology affect work practices? This paper focuses on the first question and provides some initial data on the second question. We describe a PC-phone prototype we built called Enhanced Telephony, and we report data from an eight month field deployment of Enhanced Telephony within our company where over 7,000 people installed the prototype. Results indicate that PC-phone software is a promising technology for the workplace and that the most valuable features may be those that help people manage their incoming calls.","

The article highlights the potential for Voice Assistant technology to blur the lines between work and personal life. With the integration of PC and phone technology, people may feel pressure to be constantly available and responsive to work-related calls and messages, even outside of work hours.

Orchestrating a mixed reality game 'on the ground',"Successfully staging a mixed reality game in which online players are chased through a virtual city by runners located in the real world requires extensive orchestration work. An ethnographic study shows how this concerted achievement extends beyond the control room to the runners on the street. This, in turn, suggests the need to 'decentralize' orchestration and develop support for collaboration 'on the ground'. The study leads to design proposals for orchestration interfaces for mobile experiences that augment situational awareness and surreptitious monitoring among mobile participants and support troubleshooting in situations where participants are disconnected or are unable to access positioning systems such as GPS.","Lack of privacy and surveillance.

Physically large displays improve path integration in 3D virtual navigation tasks,"Previous results have shown that users perform better on spatial orientation tasks involving static 2D scenes when working on physically large displays as compared to small ones. This was found to be true even when the displays presented the same images at equivalent visual angles. Further investigation has suggested that large displays may provide a greater sense of presence, which biases users into adopting more efficient strategies to perform tasks. In this work, we extend those findings, demonstrating that users are more effective at performing 3D virtual navigation tasks on large displays. We also show that even though interacting with the environment affects performance, effects induced by interactivity are independent of those induced by physical display size. Together, these findings allow us to derive guidelines for the design and presentation of interactive 3D environments on physically large displays.",Users may become too reliant on technology and lose ability to navigate and orient themselves in the real world.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/985692.985748,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Pointing at trivariate targets in 3D environments,"We investigate pointing in true 3D environments where the target size varies in three spatial dimensions. We also study the effect of the user's physical movement angle on pointing performance. Results show that target size dimension along the primary axis of movement has a greater impact on performance than the other two dimensions. Movement angle also significantly affects performance, and changes the relative impact of the three target dimensions. Building upon recent results in the modeling of bivariate pointing, we propose and validate a new model that describes pointing at trivariate targets. This model also accounts for movement angle, and outperforms previously published models.","

The study found that people's physical movement angle significantly affects their performance when interacting with virtual objects in 3D environments. This means that users may experience difficulty accurately pointing to virtual objects, especially when they are moving around or interacting with objects in different dimensions.

Slash(dot) and burn: distributed moderation in a large online conversation space,"Can a system of distributed moderation quickly and consistently separate high and low quality comments in an online conversation? Analysis of the site Slashdot.org suggests that the answer is a qualified yes, but that important challenges remain for designers of such systems. Thousands of users act as moderators. Final scores for comments are reasonably dispersed and the community generally agrees that moderations are fair. On the other hand, much of a conversation can pass before the best and worst comments are identified. Of those moderations that were judged unfair, only about half were subsequently counterbalanced by a moderation in the other direction. And comments with low scores, not at top-level, or posted late in a conversation were more likely to be overlooked by moderators.","

A suggestive interface for image guided 3D sketching,"We present an image guided pen-based suggestive interface for sketching 3D wireframe models. Rather than starting from a blank canvas, existing 2D images of similar objects serve as a guide to the user. Image based filters enable attraction, smoothing, and resampling of input curves, and allows for their selective application using pinning and gluing techniques. New input strokes also invoke suggestions of relevant geometry that can be used, reducing the need to explicitly draw all parts of the new model. All suggestions appear in-place with the model being built, in the user's focal attention space. A curve matching algorithm seamlessly augments basic suggestions with more complex ones from a database populated with previously used geometry. The interface also incorporates gestural command input, and interaction techniques for camera controls that enable smooth transitions between orthographic and perspective views.","

The technology described in the article could lead to a decrease in creativity and originality, as users rely on pre-existing images and suggestions rather than creating their own unique ideas. This could result in a loss of individuality and diversity in design, as well as a lack of innovation in the field of 3D modeling. Additionally, the emphasis on efficiency and ease of use may lead to a lack of attention to detail and precision in the models created, resulting in lower quality designs.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/985692.985767,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience

Virtual Reality gear that immerses a human operator into Robonaut's working environment provides the primary control pathway for remote operations. Human/robot interface challenges are addressed in the control system for teleoperators, console operators and humans working directly with the Robonaut. Multiple control modes are available for controlling the five fingered dexterous robot hands and operator selectable depending on the type of grasp required.

Think different: increasing online community participation using uniqueness and group dissimilarity,"Online communities can help people form productive relationships. Unfortunately, this potential is not always fulfilled: many communities fail, and designers don't have a solid understanding of why. We know community activity begets activity. The trick, however, is to inspire participation in the first place. Social theories suggest methods to spark positive community participation. We carried out a field experiment that tested two such theories. We formed discussion communities around an existing movie recommendation web site, manipulating two factors: (1) similarity-we controlled how similar group members' movie ratings were; and (2) uniqueness-we told members how their movie ratings (with respect to a discussion topic) were unique within the group. Both factors positively influenced participation. The results offer a practical success story in applying social science theory to the design of online communities.","Social Media can lead to the formation of echo chambers where people only interact with those who share similar views, leading to a lack of diversity in perspectives and ideas.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/985692.985772,Social Media,CHI,equality & justice
Transcendent communication: location-based guidance for large-scale public spaces,"Many studies have been conducted on supporting communication in home and office spaces, but relatively few studies have explored supporting communication in large-scale public spaces, despite the importance of such environments in our daily lives. We propose a transcendent means of communication as an emerging style in this pervasive computing era: a system that allows administrative staff to effectively help visitors in large-scale public spaces. The visitors' context is used to provide a bird's-eye view of a simulated public space for the staff to grasp the situation and point at a particular location within the view to indicate the visitors they intend to address. The results of an experiment showed synergic effects between the bird's-eye view and the first-person one in determining the spatial movements of people.

Virtual guiding avatar: an effective procedure to reduce simulator sickness in virtual environments,"This study developed a new procedure, a Virtual Guiding Avatar (VGA), which combined self-motion prediction cues and an independent visual background (IVB) to alleviate simulator sickness (SS). The VGA, which was embodied as an abstract airplane, was designed to lead the participant along a horizontal motion trajectory through a virtual environment. Both motion prediction cues and IVBs, which provide an earth-fixed reference frame, reduced SS in separate previous studies. Participants were exposed to complex visual motion through a cartoon-like simulated environment in a very wide field of view driving simulator. Participants' responses to avatars with varying motion properties - fixed, rotation only or rotation plus translation - were assessed using a within-subjects experimental design. Results indicated that SS was reduced by a VGA that presented rotational cues alone or rotation plus translation. The VGA also increased participants' sense of presence and enjoyment relative to conditions lacking a VGA. The VGA procedure can be used to enhance user experiences in immersive virtual environments as well as to improve motion simulator design.","Simulator sickness (SS)

Definition: Simulator sickness is a form of motion sickness that occurs when a person experiences disorientation and discomfort due to the conflict between what they see and what they feel in a virtual environment.

Explanation: The study aimed to reduce simulator sickness by creating a Virtual Guiding Avatar (VGA) that provided motion prediction cues and an independent visual background. The VGA helped participants feel more comfortable and present in the virtual environment, and it also increased their enjoyment. However, the study highlights the potential for simulator sickness to occur in immersive virtual environments, which could negatively impact users' experiences.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/985692.985783,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Peephole displays: pen interaction on spatially aware handheld computers,"The small size of handheld computers provides theconvenience of mobility at the expense of reduced screen space for display and interaction. Prior research has identified the value of spatially aware displays, in which a position-tracked display provides a window on a larger virtual workspace. This paper builds on that work by suggesting two-handed interaction techniques combining pen input with spatially aware displays. Enabling simultaneous navigation and manipulation yields the ability to create and edit objects larger than the screen and to drag and drop in 3-D. Four prototypes of the Peephole Display hardware were built, and several Peephole-augmented applications were written, including a drawing program, map viewer, and calendar. Multiple applications can be embedded into a personal information space anchored to the user's physical reference frame. A usability study with 24 participants shows that the Peephole technique can be more effective than current methods for navigating information on handheld computers.",Reduced screen space for display and interaction.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/642611.642613,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Multiple haptic targets for motion-impaired computer users,"Although a number of studies have reported that force feedback gravity wells can improve performance in ""point-and-click"" tasks, there have been few studies addressing issues surrounding the use of gravity wells for multiple on-screen targets. This paper investigates the performance of users, both with and without motion-impairments, in a ""point-and-click"" task when an undesired haptic distractor is present. The importance of distractor location is studied explicitly. Results showed that gravity wells can still improve times and error rates, even on occasions when the cursor is pulled into a distractor. The greatest improvement is seen for the most impaired users. In addition to traditional measures such as time and errors, performance is studied in terms of measures of cursor movement along a path. Two cursor measures, angular distribution and temporal components, are proposed and their ability to explain performance differences is explored.","

The use of force feedback gravity wells in Augmented/Virtual Reality technology can cause distractions and impairments, especially for users with motion-impairments, leading to decreased performance and increased errors in tasks that require precise cursor movement.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/642611.642620,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Comparative effectiveness of augmented reality in object assembly,"Although there has been much speculation about the potential of Augmented Reality (AR), there are very few empirical studies about its effectiveness. This paper describes an experiment that tested the relative effectiveness of AR instructions in an assembly task. Task information was displayed in user's field of view and registered with the workspace as 3D objects to explicitly demonstrate the exact execution of a procedure step. Three instructional media were compared with the AR system: a printed manual, computer assisted instruction (CAI) using a monitor-based display, and CAI utilizing a head-mounted display. Results indicate that overlaying 3D instructions on the actual work pieces reduced the error rate for an assembly task by 82%, particularly diminishing cumulative errors - errors due to previous assembly mistakes. Measurement of mental effort indicated decreased mental effort in the AR condition, suggesting some of the mental calculation of the assembly task is offloaded to the system.","

The article highlights the effectiveness of Augmented Reality (AR) instructions in reducing error rates and mental effort in an assembly task. However, it also suggests that the technology may lead to a decrease in mental calculation and problem-solving skills, as users may rely more heavily on the system for guidance. This could result in a loss of critical thinking abilities and a reduced ability to adapt to new situations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/642611.642626,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Women go with the (optical) flow,"Previous research reported interesting gender effects involving specific benefits for females navigating with wider fields of view on large displays. However, it was not clear what was driving the 3D navigation performance gains, and whether or not the effect was more tightly coupled to gender or to spatial abilities. The study we report in this paper replicates and extends previous work, demonstrating that the gender-specific navigation benefits come from the presence of optical flow cues, which are better afforded by wider fields of view on large displays. The study also indicates that the effect may indeed be tied to gender, as opposed to spatial abilities. Together, the findings provide a significant contribution to the HCI community, as we provide strong recommendations for the design and presentation of 3D environments, backed by empirical data. Additionally, these recommendations reliably benefit females, without an accompanying detriment to male navigation performance.","None. The study aimed to provide recommendations for the design and presentation of 3D environments that benefit females without negatively affecting male navigation performance. The findings suggest that incorporating optical flow cues in 3D navigation environments can improve performance for females, while not harming male performance.

Designing social presence of social actors in human computer interaction,"This study examines the interaction effect between user factors and media factors on feelings of social presence which are critical in the design of virtual reality systems and human computer interfaces. Both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 show that matching synthesized voice personality to user personality positively affects users' (especially extrovert users') feelings of social presence. Experiment 2 also reveals that users feel a stronger sense of social presence when the personality of synthesized voice matches the personality of textual content than when those two are mismatched. In both experiments, extrovert voice induces a stronger sense of presence than introvert voice. These results provide strong evidence for human's automatic social responses to artificial representations possessing humanistic properties such as language and personality. Finally, we discuss various applications of these findings in the design of human computer interfaces, as well as in the study of presence.","

Users may feel a stronger sense of social presence when interacting with virtual assistants or AI systems that match their personality, leading to a blurring of boundaries between human and artificial interactions. This could result in an over-reliance on technology and a decrease in face-to-face interactions with real people, potentially leading to social isolation and loneliness.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/642611.642662,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,social norms & relationship
How do people manage their digital photographs?,"In this paper we present and discuss the findings of a study that investigated how people manage their collections of digital photographs. The six-month, 13-participant study included interviews, questionnaires, and analysis of usage statistics gathered from an instrumented digital photograph management tool called Shoebox. Alongside simple browsing features such as folders, thumbnails and timelines, Shoebox has some advanced multimedia features: content-based image retrieval and speech recognition applied to voice annotations. Our results suggest that participants found their digital photos much easier to manage than their non-digital ones, but that this advantage was almost entirely due to the simple browsing features. The advanced features were not used very often and their perceived utility was low. These results should help to inform the design of improved tools for managing personal digital photographs.","
The study found that people didn't use advanced features like content-based image retrieval and speech recognition in managing their digital photos, despite their availability. This suggests that people may not be taking full advantage of the benefits of technology, and may be relying too heavily on simple browsing features.

Effects of head-mounted and scene-oriented video systems on remote collaboration on physical tasks,"This study assessed the value of two video configurations-a head-mounted camera with eye tracking capability and a scene camera providing a view of the work environment-on remote collaboration on physical (3D) tasks. Pairs of participants performed five robot construction tasks in five media conditions: side-by-side, audio-only, head-mounted camera, scene camera, and scene plus head cameras. Task completion times were shortest in the side-by-side condition, and shorter with the scene camera than in the audio-only condition. Participants rated their work quality highest when side-by-side, intermediate with the scene camera, and worst in the audio-only and head-camera conditions. Similarly, helpers' self-rated ability to assist workers and pairs' communication efficiency were highest in the side-by-side condition, but significantly higher with the scene camera than in the audio-only condition. The results demonstrate the value of a shared view of the work environment for remote collaboration on physical tasks.","

The study found that remote collaboration using head-mounted cameras and eye tracking capability can lead to decreased task completion times and lower quality work compared to working side-by-side. Participants also rated their work quality lower when using head-mounted cameras, and helpers' self-rated ability to assist workers and pairs' communication efficiency were lower with head-mounted cameras compared to a shared view of the work environment. This suggests that over-reliance on technology can lead to decreased productivity and collaboration, and that a shared physical environment is important for effective collaboration on physical tasks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/642611.642701,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
The impact of avatar realism and eye gaze control on perceived quality of communication in a shared immersive virtual environment,"This paper presents an experiment designed to investigate the impact of scommunication in an immersive virtual environment.Participants were paired by gender and were randomly assigned to a CAVE-like system or a head-mounted display. Both were represented by a humanoid avatar in the shared 3D environment. The visual appearance of the avatars was either basic and genderless (like a ""match-stick"" figure), or more photorealistic and gender-specific. Similarly, eye gaze behavior was either random or inferred from voice, to reflect different levels of behavioral realism.Our comparative analysis of 48 post-experiment questionnaires confirms earlier findings from non-immersive studies using semi-photorealistic avatars, where inferred gaze significantly outperformed random gaze. However responses to the lower-realism avatar are adversely affected by inferred gaze, revealing a significant interaction effect between appearance and behavior. We discuss the importance of aligning visual and behavioral realism for increased avatar effectiveness.","

The use of photorealistic avatars in virtual reality can lead to a decrease in effectiveness if the avatar's behavior does not match the user's expectations, resulting in a negative impact on the user's experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/642611.642703,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Lessons from the lighthouse: collaboration in a shared mixed reality system,"Museums attract increasing numbers of online visitors along with their conventional physical visitors. This paper presents a study of a mixed reality system that allows web, virtual reality and physical visitors to share a museum visit together in real time. Our system allows visitors to share their location and orientation, communicate over a voice channel, and jointly navigate around a shared information space. Results from a study of 34 users of the system show that visiting with the system was highly interactive and retained many of the attractions of a traditional shared exhibition visit. Specifically, users could navigate together, collaborate around objects and discuss exhibits. These findings have implications for non-museum settings, in particular how location awareness is a powerful resource for collaboration, and how 'hybrid objects' can support collaboration at-a-distance.","

The shared information space in the mixed reality system could potentially lead to a loss of personal privacy and security, as users' locations and orientations are constantly being tracked and shared with others. This could be especially problematic in non-museum settings, where users may not be aware of who else is sharing their space or what information is being shared. Additionally, the system's reliance on location awareness could lead to a sense of disorientation or discomfort for some users, particularly those who are not used to navigating virtual spaces.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/642611.642711,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,security & privacy
Recommending collaboration with social networks: a comparative evaluation,"Studies of information seeking and workplace collaboration often find that social relationships are a strong factor in determining who collaborates with whom. Social networks provide one means of visualizing existing and potential interaction in organizational settings. Groupware designers are using social networks to make systems more sensitive to social situations and guide users toward effective collaborations. Yet, the implications of embedding social networks in systems have not been systematically studied. This paper details an evaluation of two different social networks used in a system to recommend individuals for possible collaboration. The system matches people looking for expertise with individuals likely to have expertise. The effectiveness of social networks for matching individuals is evaluated and compared. One finding is that social networks embedded into systems do not match individuals' perceptions of their personal social network. This finding and others raise issues for the use of social networks in groupware. Based on the evaluation results, several design considerations are discussed.","Social Media technology can misrepresent individuals' personal social networks, leading to ineffective collaborations and potential issues in groupware design.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/642611.642714,Social Media,CHI,user experience
The augurscope: a mixed reality interface for outdoors,"The augurscope is a portable mixed reality interface for outdoors. A tripod-mounted display is wheeled to different locations and rotated and tilted to view a virtual environment that is aligned with the physical background.

Our design encompasses physical form, interaction and the combination of a GPS receiver, electronic compass, accelerometer and rotary encoder for tracking. An initial application involves the public exploring a medieval castle from the site of its modern replacement. Analysis of use reveals problems with lighting, movement and relating virtual and physical viewpoints, and shows how environmental factors and physical form affect interaction. We suggest that problems might be accommodated by carefully constructing virtual and physical content","

"Movement model, hits distribution and learning in virtual keyboarding","In a ten-session experiment, six participants practiced typing with an expanding rehearsal method on an optimized virtual keyboard. Based on a large amount of in-situ performance data, this paper reports the following findings. First, the Fitts-digraph movement efficiency model of virtual keyboards is revised. The format and parameters of Fitts' law used previously in virtual keyboards research were incorrect. Second, performance limit predictions of various layouts are calculated with the new model. Third, learning with expanding rehearsal intervals for maximum memory benefits is effective, but many improvements of the training algorithm used can be made in the future. Finally, increased visual load when typing previously practiced text did not significantly change users' performance at this stage of learning, but typing unpracticed text did have a performance effect, suggesting a certain degree of text specific learning when typing on virtual keyboards","

The study found that increased visual load when typing previously practiced text did not significantly change users' performance, but typing unpracticed text did have a performance effect. This suggests that there may be a limit to the benefits of using virtual keyboards, and that users may not be able to achieve the same level of performance as with physical keyboards. Additionally, the study found that the training algorithm used can be improved, indicating that there may be a need for further development and refinement of virtual keyboard technology before it can be widely adopted.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/503376.503381,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Comparing voodoo dolls and HOMER: exploring the importance of feedback in virtual environments,"When creating techniques for manipulating objects at a distance in immersive virtual environments, researchers have primarily focused on increasing selection range, placement range, and placement accuracy. This focus has led researchers to create and formally study a series of ""arm-extension"" techniques, which dynamically scale the user's arm to allow him to manipulate distant objects. Researchers have also developed representation-based techniques, which allow users to manipulate a distant object by manipulating a copy of it in a handheld representation. However, researchers have not yet formally established the relative value of these techniques. In this paper we present a formal study comparing Voodoo Dolls, a best-practice representation-based technique, with HOMER, a best-practice arm-extension technique. We found that the Voodoo Dolls technique, which provides better feedback by allowing users to view a manipulated object both up close and at a distance, allowed users to both position and orient objects more accurately. Our results suggest that researchers should focus on improving feedback for 3D manipulation techniques","

The use of arm-extension techniques in virtual reality environments can lead to a decrease in accuracy when manipulating objects, as users may have difficulty judging distance and scale. Additionally, representation-based techniques may provide better feedback and accuracy, but may also lead to a decrease in the sense of immersion and presence in the virtual environment.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/503376.503396,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
Women take a wider view,"Published reports suggest that males significantly outperform females in navigating virtual environments. A novel navigation technique reported in CHI 2001, when combined with a large display and wide field of view, appeared to reduce that gender bias. That work has been extended with two navigation studies in order to understand the finding under carefully controlled conditions. The first study replicated the finding that a wide field of view coupled with a large display benefits both male and female users and reduces gender bias. The second study suggested that wide fields of view on a large display were useful to females despite a more densely populated virtual world. Implications for design of virtual worlds and large displays are discussed.

Evaluating the effectiveness of spatial memory in 2D and 3D physical and virtual environments,"User interfaces can improve task performance by exploiting the powerful human capabilities for spatial cognition. This opportunity has been demonstrated by many prior experiments. It is tempting to believe that providing greater spatial flexibility-by moving from flat 2D to 3D user interfaces-will further enhance user performance. This paper describes an experiment that investigates the effectiveness of spatial memory in real-world physical models and in equivalent computer-based virtual systems. The different models vary the user's freedom to use depth and perspective in spatial arrangements of images representing web pages. Results show that the subjects' performance deteriorated in both the physical and virtual systems as their freedom to locate items in the third dimension increased. Subjective measures reinforce the performance measures, indicating that users found interfaces with higher dimensions more 'cluttered' and less efficient","

Improving focus targeting in interactive fisheye views,"Fisheye views allow people to see both a focus region and the surrounding context in the same window. However, the magnification effects of the fisheye lens can cause several problems for users. One of these is focus-targeting, where a user moves the focus to a new location. Magnification makes focus-targeting difficult because objects appear to move as the focus point approaches them. This paper examines how the distortion of a fisheye view affects focus-targeting performance, and present a technique called speed-coupled flattening (SCF) as a way to improve focus targeting in distortion-oriented views. SCF dynamically reduces the distortion level of a fisheye based on pointer velocity and acceleration. In an experiment, the technique resulted in significant reductions in both targeting time and targeting errors. By adjusting distortion based on the user's activity, we can improve usability without requiring the user to manipulate any additional view controls","Distortion in fisheye views can make it difficult for users to accurately target objects in virtual reality environments, leading to longer targeting times and more errors.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/503376.503424,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"SCANMail: a voicemail interface that makes speech browsable, readable and searchable","Increasing amounts of public, corporate, and private speech data are now available on-line. These are limited in their usefulness, however, by the lack of tools to permit their browsing and search. The goal of our research is to provide tools to overcome the inherent difficulties of speech access, by supporting visual scanning, search, and information extraction. We describe a novel principle for the design of UIs to speech data: What You See Is Almost What You Hear (WYSIAWYH). In WYSIAWYH, automatic speech recognition (ASR) generates a transcript of the speech data. The transcript is then used as a visual analogue to that underlying data. A graphical user interface allows users to visually scan, read, annotate and search these transcripts. Users can also use the transcript to access and play specific regions of the underlying message. We first summarize previous studies of voicemail usage that motivated the WYSIAWYH principle, and describe a voicemail UI, SCANMail, that embodies WYSIAWYH. We report on a laboratory experiment and a two-month field trial evaluation. SCANMail outperformed a state of the art voicemail system on core voicemail tasks. This was attributable to SCANMail's support for visual scanning, search and information extraction. While the ASR transcripts contain errors, they nevertheless improve the efficiency of voicemail processing. Transcripts either provide enough information for users to extract key points or to navigate to important regions of the underlying speech, which they can then play directly","

The use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology in voice assistants can lead to errors in transcription, which can result in miscommunication or misunderstandings. This can be particularly problematic in situations where accurate information is critical, such as in legal or medical contexts. Additionally, the reliance on ASR technology can also lead to a loss of nuance and context in communication, as the focus is on the written transcript rather than the spoken words. This can lead to a dehumanization of communication and a loss of personal connection.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/503376.503426,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
A comparative study of speech in the call center: natural language call routing vs. touch-tone menus,"This paper presents a field study that compares natural language call routing with standard touch-tone menus. Call routing is the task of getting callers to the right place in the call center, which could be the appropriate live agent or automated service. Natural language call routing lets callers describe the reason for their call in their own words, instead of presenting them with a list of menu options to select from using the telephone touch-tone keypad. The field study was conducted in a call center of a large telecommunication service provider. Results show that with natural language call routing, more callers respond to the main routing prompt, more callers are routed to a specific destination (instead of defaulting to a general operator who may have to transfer them), and more callers are routed to the correct agent. Our survey data show that callers overwhelmingly prefer natural language call routing over standard touch-tone menus. Furthermore, natural language call routing can also deliver significant cost savings to call centers","

The use of natural language call routing technology in call centers may lead to a decrease in the number of jobs available for human operators, as more calls are routed directly to the appropriate agent or automated service.

"Exploiting interactivity, influence, space and time to explore non-linear drama in virtual worlds","We present four contrasting interfaces to allow multiple viewers to explore 3D recordings of dramas in on-line virtual worlds.

The third is a tabletop projection surface that allows viewers to select detailed views from a bird's-eye overview. The fourth is a linear television broadcast created by a director or editor. A comparison of these examples shows how a viewing audience can exploit four general resources - interactivity, influence, space, and time - to make sense of complex, non-linear virtual drama.

Orchestrating a mixed reality performance,"A study of a professional touring mixed reality performance called Desert Rain yields insights into how performers orchestrate players' engagement in an interactive experience. Six players at a time journey through an extended physical and virtual set. Each sees a virtual world projected onto a screen made from a fine water spray. This acts as a traversable interface, supporting the illusion that performers physically pass between real and virtual worlds. Live and video-based observations of Desert Rain, coupled with interviews with players and the production team, have revealed how the performers create conditions for the willing suspension of disbelief, and how they monitor and intervene in the players experience without breaking their engagement. This involves carefully timed performances and “off-face” and “virtual” interventions. In turn, these are supported by the ability to monitor players' physical and virtual activity through asymmetric interfaces.","Performers can manipulate players' experiences in AR/VR without their knowledge or consent, potentially leading to a loss of agency and autonomy for the users.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365033,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
"Responding to subtle, fleeting changes in the user's internal state","In human-to-human interaction, people sometimes are able to pick up and respond sensitively to the other's internal state as it shifts moment by moment over the course of an exchange. To find out whether such an ability is worthwhile for computer human interfaces, we built a semi-automated tutoring-type spoken dialog system. The system inferred information about the user's \scare{ephemeral emotions}, such as confidence, confusion, pleasure, and dependency, from the prosody of his utterances and the context. It used this information to select the most appropriate acknowledgement form at each moment. In doing so the system was following some of the basic social conventions for real-time interaction. Users rated the system with this ability more highly than a version without.","

An “independent visual background” reduced balance disturbance envoked by visual scene motion: implication for alleviating simulator sickness,"Simulator sickness (SS) / virtual environment (VE) sickness is expected to become increasingly troublesome as VE technology evolves [20]. Procedures to alleviate SS / VE sickness have been of limited value [12]. This paper investigated a possible procedure to reduce SS and VE sickness. Postural disturbance was evoked by visual scene motion at different frequencies. Differences in disturbance were examined as a function of simultaneous exposure to an “independent visual background” (IVB). Eight subjects were tested at two scene motion frequencies and three different IVB conditions using a within-subjects design. An expected statistically significant interaction between IVB condition and frequency was observed. For low frequency scene movements, subjects exhibited less balance disturbance when the IVB was presented. We suggest that an IVB may alleviate disturbance when conflicting visual and inertial cues are likely to result in simulator or VE sickness.","Simulator/Virtual Environment (VE) sickness, which includes postural disturbance, balance disturbance, and disorientation, can occur when using Augmented/Virtual Reality technology, especially when there is a conflict between visual and inertial cues.

Predicting the effects of in-car interfaces on driver behavior using a cognitive architecture,"When designing and evaluating in-car user interfaces for drivers, it is essential to determine what effects these interfaces may have on driver behavior and performance. This paper describes a novel approach to predicting effects of in-car interfaces by modeling behavior in a cognitive architecture. A cognitive architecture is a theoretical frame-work for building computational models of cognition and performance. The proposed approach centers on integrating a user model for the interface with an existing driver model that accounts for basic aspects of driver behavior (e.g., steering and speed control). By running the integrated model and having it interact with the interface while driving, we can generate a priori predictions of the effects of interface use on driver performance. The paper illustrates the approach by comparing four representative dialing interfaces for an in-car, hands-free cellular phone. It also presents an empirical study that validates several of the qualitative and quantitative predictions of the model.","Distracted driving due to in-car interfaces.

The article discusses the importance of considering the effects of in-car user interfaces on driver behavior and performance. The proposed approach integrates a user model for the interface with an existing driver model to predict the effects of interface use on driver performance.

Doom as an interface for process management,"This paper explores a novel interface to a system administration task. Instead of creating an interface de novo for the task, the author modified a popular computer game, Doom, to perform useful work. The game was chosen for its appeal to the target audience of system administrators. The implementation described is not a mature application, but it illustrates important points about user interfaces and our relationship with computers. The applications relies on a computer game vernacular rather than the simulations of physical reality found in typical navigable virtual environments. Using a computer game vocabulary may broaden an application's audience by providing sn intuitive environment for children and non-technical users. In addition, the application highlights the adversarial relationships that exist in a computer and suggests a new resource allocation scheme.","

"Shall we mix synthetic speech and human speech?: impact on users' performance, perception, and attitude","Because it is impractical to record human voice for ever-changing dynamic content such as email messages and news, many commercial speech applications use human speech for fixed prompts and synthetic speech (TTS) for the dynamic content. However, this mixing approach may not be optimal from a consistency perspective. A 2-condition between-group experiment (N = 24) was conducted to compare two versions of a virtual-assistant interface (mixing human voice and TTS vs. TTS-only). Users interacted with the virtual assistant to manage some email and calendar tasks. Their task performance, self-perception of task performance, and attitudinal responses were measured. Users interacting with the TTS-only interface performed the task significantly better, while users interacting with the mixed-voices interface thought they did better and had more positive attitudinal responses. Explanations and design implications are suggested.",Voice Assistant technology can lead to inconsistent user experience and decreased performance due to the mixing of human speech and synthetic speech.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365090,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
On the road and on the Web?: comprehension of synthetic and human speech while driving,"In this study 24 participants drove a simulator while listening to three types of messages in both synthesized speech and recorded human speech. The messages consisted of short navigation messages, medium length (approximately 100 words) email messages, and longer news stories (approximately 200 words). After each message the participant was presented with a series of multiple choice questions to measure comprehension of the message. Driving performance was recorded. Findings show that for the low driving workload conditions in the study, (cruise control, predictable two-lane road with no intersections, invariant lead car) driving performance was not affected by listening to messages. This was true for both the synthesized speech and natural speech. Comprehension of messages in synthetic speech was significantly lower than for recorded human speech for all message types.","Voice Assistant technology may impair users' comprehension of messages, especially when delivered in synthesized speech.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365100,Voice Assistant,CHI,user experience
ConNexus to awarenex: extending awareness to mobile users,"We explored the use of awareness information to facilitate communication by developing a series of prototypes. The ConNexus prototype integrates awareness information, instant messaging, and other communication channels in an interface that runs on a desktop computer. The Awarenex prototype extends that functionality to wireless handheld devices, such as a Palm. A speech interface also enables callers to make use of the awareness information over the telephone. While the prototypes offer similar functionality, the interfaces reflect the different design affordances and use context of each platform. We discuss the design implications of providing awareness information on devices with varying interface and network characteristics.","

The integration of awareness information in Voice Assistant technology could lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication and deepen social isolation. People may rely more on technology and less on human interaction, potentially harming their social skills and overall well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365105,Voice Assistant,CHI,social norms & relationship
Surface drawing: creating organic 3D shapes with the hand and tangible tools,"Surface Drawing is a system for creating organic 3D shapes in a manner which supports the needs and interests of artists. This medium facilitates the early stages of creative design which many 3D modeling programs neglect. Much like traditional media such as line drawing and painting, Surface Drawing lets users construct shapes through repeated marking. In our case, the hand is used to mark 3D space in a semi-immersive virtual environment. The interface is completed with tangible tools to edit and manipulate models. We introduce the use of tongs to move and scale 3D shapes and demonstrate a magnet tool which is comfortably held without restricting hand motion. We evaluated our system through collaboration with artists and designers, exhibition before hundreds of users, our own extensive exploration of the medium, and an informal user study. Response was especially positive from users with an artistic background.","

The article highlights the potential for Augmented/Virtual Reality technology to neglect the needs and interests of artists in the creative design process. Traditional media, such as line drawing and painting, are often overlooked in favor of more advanced 3D modeling programs. This could result in a lack of creative freedom and expression for artists, as well as a lack of consideration for the early stages of the design process. Additionally, the use of tongs and a magnet tool may restrict hand motion and limit the user's ability to manipulate 3D shapes in a natural and intuitive way. This could lead to frustration and discomfort for users, and may hinder the adoption of the technology.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365114,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
DataTiles: a modular platform for mixed physical and graphical interactions,"The DataTiles system integrates the benefits of two major interaction paradigms: graphical and physical user interfaces. Tagged transparent tiles are used as modular construction units. These tiles are augmented by dynamic graphical information when they are placed on a sensor-enhanced flat panel display. They can be used independently or can be combined into more complex configurations, similar to the way language can express complex concepts through a sequence of simple words. In this paper, we discuss our design principles for mixing physical and graphical interface techniques, and describe the system architecture and example applications of the DataTiles system.","

The integration of graphical and physical user interfaces in the DataTiles system may lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication and social skills, as users become more reliant on technology and less inclined to interact with others in person. This could result in a loss of important social connections and a decrease in overall well-being.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365115,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,health & well-being
The impact of eye gaze on communication using humanoid avatars,"In this paper we describe an experiment designed to investigate the importance of eye gaze in humanoid avatar's representing people engaged in conversation. We compare responses to dyadic conversations in four mediated conditions: video, audio-only, and two avatar conditions. The avatar conditions differed only in their treatment of eye gaze. In the random-gaze condition the avatars head and eye animations were unrelated to conversational flow. In the informed-gaze condition, they were related to turn-taking during the conversation. The head animations were tracked and the eye animations were inferred from the audio stream. Our comparative analysis of 100 post-experiment questionnaires showed that the random-gaze avatar did not improve on audio-only communication. The informed-gaze avatar significantly outperformed the random-gaze model and also outperformed audio-only on several response measures. We conclude that an avatar whose gaze behaviour is related to the conversation provides a marked improvement on an avatar that merely exhibits liveliness.","

Social navigation of food recipes,"The term Social Navigation captures every-day behaviour used to find information, people, and places - namely through watching, following, and talking to people. We discuss how to design information spaces to allow for social navigation. We applied our ideas in a recipe recommendation system. In a follow-up user study, subjects state that social navigation adds value to the service: it provides for social affordance, and it helps turning a space into a social place. The study also reveals some unresolved design issues, such as the snowball effect where more and more users follow each other down the wrong path, and privacy issues.","Social Media can lead to a snowball effect where users follow each other down the wrong path, and privacy issues.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365130,Social Media,CHI,security & privacy
Identity construction environments: supporting a virtual therapeutic community of pediatric patients undergoing dialysis,"We describe a five-month pilot project conducted in the dialysis unit at Boston's Children's Hospital. Pediatric patients with renal disease used the Zora graphical multi-user environment while facing hemodialysis. Zora is an identity construciton environment specifically designed to help young people explore issues of identity, while engaging in a participatory virtual community. This paper presents the experience and evaluates the feasibility and safety of using Zora in a hospital setting. It describes how Zora facilitated explorations of identity and mutual patient support and interaction. Finally it also presents design recommendations for future interventions of this kind. More generally, this paper explores the potential of technology specifically designed with therapeutic purposes to help patients cope with their illness.","

Social presence in Web surveys,"Social interface theory has widespread influence in the field of human-computer interaction. The basic thesis is that humanizing cues in a computer interface can engender responses from users similar to human-human interaction. In contrast, the survey interviewing literature suggests that computer administration of surveys on highly sensitive topics reduces or eliminates social desirability effect, even when such humanizing features as voice are used. In attempting to reconcile these apparently contradictory findings, we varied features of the interface in a Web survey (n=3047). In one treatment, we presented an image of 1) a male researcher, 2) a female researcher, or 3) the study logo at several points. In another, we varied the extent of personal feedback provided. We find little support for the soical interface hypothesis. We describe our study and discuss possible reasons for the contradictory evidence on social interfaces","

Reaching movements to augmented and graphic objects in virtual environments,"This work explores how the availability of visual and haptic feedback affects and kinematics of reaching performance in a tabletop virtual environment. Eight subjects performed reach-to-grasp movements toward target objects of various sites in conitions where visual and haptic feedback were either present or absent. It was found that movement time was slower when visual feedback of the moving limb was not available. Further MT varied systematically with target size when haptic feedback was available (i.e. augmented targets), and thus followed Fitts' law. However, movement times were constant regardless of target size when haptic feedback was removed. In depth analysis of the reaching kinematics revealed that subjects spent longer decelerating toward smaller targets in conditions where haptic feedback was available. In contrast, deceleration time was constant when haptic feedback was absent. These results suggest that visual feedback about the moving limb and veridical haptic feedback about object contract are extremely important for humans to effectively work in virtual environments.","

* Decreased movement speed and accuracy due to lack of visual and haptic feedback.
* Increased difficulty in performing tasks that require fine motor control, such as grasping small objects.
* Inability to effectively work in virtual environments without proper feedback.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365308,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
3D or not 3D?: evaluating the effect of the third dimension in a document management system,"Several recent research systems have provided interactive three-dimensional (3D) visualisations for supporting everyday work such as file and document management. But what improvements do these 3D interfaces offer over their traditional 2D counterparts? This paper describes the comparative evaluation of two document management systems that differ only in the number of dimensions used for displaying and interacting with the data. The 3D system is heavily based on Robertson et al.'s Data Mountain, which supports users in storing, organising and retrieving “thumbnail” representations of documents such as bookmarked Web-pages. Results show that our subjects were faster at storing and retrieving pages in the display when using the 2D interface, but not significantly so. As expected, retrieval times significantly increased as the number of thumbnails increased. Despite the lack of significant differences between the 2D and 3D interfaces, subjective assessments showed a significant preference for the 3D interface.","

The use of 3D interfaces for document management can lead to increased retrieval times as the number of thumbnails increases, which can negatively impact productivity and efficiency.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/365024.365309,Augmented/Virtual Reality,CHI,user experience
