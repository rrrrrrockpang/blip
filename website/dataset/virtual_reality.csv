0,Facebook data concerns spread to Oculus and VR,"Facebook is currently facing hard questions about how it handles user information, but most of the discussion has focused on the social network itself. Facebook owns plenty of other apps and services — including the Oculus virtual reality platform, which (like all VR platforms) collects incredibly detailed information about where users are looking and how they’re moving. VR headsets have a clear potential for surveillance and data harvesting, and Facebook has a bad track record regarding protecting privacy. So what exactly is the link between Oculus and Facebook as far as user privacy is concerned?

A VR platform like Oculus offers lots of data points that could be turned into a detailed user profile. Facebook already records a “heatmap” of viewer data for 360-degree videos, for instance, flagging which parts of a video people find most interesting. If it decided to track VR users at a more detailed level, it could do something like track overall movement patterns with hand controllers, then guess whether someone is sick or tired on a particular day. Oculus imagines people using its headsets the way they use phones and computers today, which would let it track all kinds of private communications.

The Oculus privacy policy has a blanket clause that lets it share and receive information from Facebook and Facebook-owned services. So far, the company claims that it exercises this option in very limited ways, and none of them involve giving data to Facebook advertisers. “Oculus does not share people’s data with Facebook for third-party advertising,” a spokesperson tells The Verge.

Oculus says Facebook isn’t using its data for advertising

Oculus says there are some types of data it either doesn’t share or doesn’t retain at all. The platform collects physical information like height to calibrate VR experiences, but apparently, it doesn’t share any of it with Facebook. It stores posts that are made on the Oculus forums, but not voice communications between users in VR, although it may retain records of connections between them.

The company also offers a few examples of when it would share data with Facebook or vice versa. Most obviously, if you’re using a Facebook-created VR app like Spaces, Facebook gets information about what you’re doing there, much in the same way that any third-party app developer would.

You can optionally link your Facebook account to your Oculus ID, in which case, Oculus will use your Facebook interests to suggest specific apps or games. If you’ve linked the accounts, any friend you add on Facebook will also become your friend on Oculus, if they’re on the platform. The reverse won’t be true, however, so you can friend someone on Oculus without adding them on Facebook. (You can also de-link accounts, as explained on a support page.)

Behind the scenes, Oculus apparently shares data between the two services to fight certain kinds of banned activity. “If we find someone using their account to send spam on one service, we can disable all of their accounts,” the spokesperson says. Similarly, if there’s “strange activity” on a specific Oculus account, they can share the IP address it’s coming from with Facebook.

Oculus hasn’t had any high-profile privacy blowups the way that Facebook has, but concerned VR users have been raising red flags about it for years. Former Minnesota senator Al Franken questioned Oculus about its data collection policies in 2016, for instance; the company responded with answers similar to the ones I’ve described above.

The biggest problem is that there’s nothing stopping Facebook and Oculus from choosing to share more data in the future. VR journalist Kent Bye raised this concern in a report last year, quoting Oculus product VP Nate Mitchell admitting that “used in the wrong way or in the wrong hands, you can be tracked probably more than you would normally expect to be” in VR.

A lot of VR data mining isn’t that different from existing methods

As intimate as VR surveillance seems, it’s still (as far as we know) not nearly as invasive or all-encompassing as Facebook’s app and web surveillance. Some of the things that Oculus collects, like location data and IP address, are already being collected by Facebook apps and pages. VR headsets can tell where you’re looking, but an ordinary webpage can achieve a similar effect by tracking where you’re moving your mouse or clicking.

But if mixed reality technology advances, this is going to become a much more important issue. Writer and game developer Chet Faliszek points out that augmented reality glasses would collect far more data than present-day VR goggles, if you’re wearing them for long periods of time in everyday life. (I’ve written a bit already about AR’s huge privacy implications.) Facebook sees AR glasses as the future, and any precedent Oculus sets today could affect Facebook’s mixed reality privacy policies down the road.

Right now, Oculus’ privacy stance is ambiguous: it’s supposedly sharing relatively little user information with Facebook but leaving its options open. If you’re worried about VR’s long-term privacy implications, this isn’t encouraging. But in the short term, most VR users will still be giving Facebook more data with old-fashioned clicks and shares.",VR,Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/9/17206650/oculus-facebook-vr-user-data-mining-privacy-policy-advertising,"VR headsets have the potential to collect detailed user data, which could be used for surveillance and data harvesting.

1,"VR pioneer Jaron Lanier on dystopia, empathy, and the future of the internet","Jaron Lanier is one of virtual reality’s most recognizable figures. He’s credited with popularizing the term itself, and he co-founded VPL, a short-lived but groundbreaking company that built some of the first commercial VR headsets. Since then, Lanier has been better known for his writing on digital ownership and internet ecosystems, with the books You Are Not A Gadget and Who Owns the Future? But his most recent work revisits the world of ‘80s and ‘90s VR, as well as the rest of Lanier’s life — including his early years on the Texas-Mexico border, his childhood living in a self-designed geodesic dome, and the tumultuous process of founding VPL.

Dawn of the New Everything: Encounters with Reality and Virtual Reality debuted last month, and we met up with Lanier to talk about how first-wave VR intersects with present-day reality, why empathy is a double-edged sword, and whether we’ll have to burn down the internet.

This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

You had a childhood you describe as almost magical-realist. A lot of parts feel like they couldn’t happen now.

“That ability to move through different cultures was very important to my early life.”

Well, it certainly couldn’t happen in the same geographical place, because I grew up on the border with Mexico, which used to be this very sweet open border between two very different cultures. And I think that ability to move through very different environments, different cultures, easily was very important to my early life. I think it helped shape my sense of what’s possible with people. And I think if you grew up along that border today and there’s this huge military-scale barrier, you’d probably get exactly the opposite impression of the world: that change is impossible and things can only be as they are.

Can online communication offer that kind of openness?

Well, that’s what we’d like. Unfortunately, what’s happened is that the online world has been structured by what I view as the perverse financial incentives of the advertising model into exactly the opposite, where people are corralled into these groups that are made to be as annoyed as possible with each other. So we’re effectively creating a wall between people that’s analogous to the big wall going up with Mexico now.

I’m curious whether you think virtual reality promotes empathy, something you mention in Dawn of the New Everything.

“Empathy should sometimes be angry.”

If you were interviewing my 20-something self, I’d be all over the place with this very eloquent and guru-like pitch that VR was the ultimate empathy machine — that through VR we’d be able to experience a broader range of identities and it would help us see the world in a broader way and be less stuck in our own heads.

That rhetoric has been quite present in recent VR culture, but there are no guarantees there. There was recently this kind of ridiculous fail where [Mark] Zuckerberg was showing devastation in Puerto Rico and saying, “This is a great empathy machine, isn’t it magical to experience this?” While he’s in this devastated place that the country’s abandoned. And there’s something just enraging about that. Empathy should sometimes be angry, if anger is the appropriate response.

There’s also a larger case against empathy, which argues it can be used for terrible ends.

Empathy can be turned to terrible ends because people behave like jerks when they turn into tribes or packs. The problem with the online world today is that to maximize engagement, you need to maximize emotional engagement, and the emotions that are most engaging are the negative ones.

I think a lot of people perceive a sort of arc of improving empathy and ethics in civilization. Recently, it’s been reversed. The Arab Spring turned into this terrible wave of terrorist nihilism. When women got together to try and improve their lot in the gaming world, it turned into Gamergate, which turned into the alt-right. Black Lives Matter preceded this normalization of racism and white supremacy that was just unthinkable a year before.

All of these movements, that are so social media-centric, provide the fuel to the social media system. But to maximize the value of that fuel, it’s routed into negative purposes, so the people who are the most irritated by whatever is going on that’s positive are introduced to each other. The backlash is vastly more powerful than the initial attempt. My prediction is that #MeToo will create some kind of horrible social event through social media in about a year.

You do touch on imagining optimistic futures in Dawn of the New Everything, including a great anecdote where you told William Gibson to stop making his stories so depressing.

“It just seems as though cautionary tales don’t work.”

One of the themes in this book is the sort of futility of trying to warn about dangers. I had this crazy idea when I was in my early 20s that maybe just through trying to imagine a better world instead of dystopias, maybe it would just happen through that process of articulation. So when the cyberpunk movement started up, I did have these preposterous arguments with Bill Gibson, saying, “Oh my god, you’re making it so dark! You’re going to curse it!” And of course I was being ridiculous. I completely acknowledge that now.

But I should say, it’s a bit of a problem, because I’ve tried it both ways. It just seems as though cautionary tales don’t work. I think straightforward rational argument is still the best tool to make a better future. I feel like storytelling for some reason doesn’t rouse people from their immediate attraction to coolness, and that actually turns out to be poisonous.

Back to VR, the book has some interesting little details. Like, you said you were working on a VR sport for the Olympics?

It’s funny, I think I’m still under a contract where I’m not supposed to talk about it. There had been a lot of interest in VR in the ‘80s and early ‘90s, and the Olympics Committee had said yeah, could we do a sport in VR? It was like a cross between some of the NASA training systems that simulated antigravity, and some other things. It was quite unlike things that are supported by current commercial VR. I still think it’s a really cool idea, and I think a lot of people would enjoy it.

There was also a bizarre prototype of a VR taste simulator.

“We have developed the ability to disgust you.”

I’d given a talk in Japan, where I said we could imagine this robotic chemical emitter thing that would simulate the textures and flavors of foods. My joke was that it was too disgusting to contemplate. And then I got this very formal letter from one of the wonderful VR labs in Japan, saying, “We are pleased to announce that we have developed the ability to disgust you.”

It was like this rubber thing with all these little robotic effectors inside it that could collapse or move, and it had all these little nozzles that would squirt flavors out of little holes. You would stick it in your mouth and start chewing on it. It was really hard to sterilize between users, and really hard to initialize, and really kind of crazy. But yeah, it’s one of the many wonderful VR devices lost to the sands of time.

That does sound really disgusting.

It is absolutely the most repulsive user interface item I have ever seen. Well, it’s got some competition. But it’s up there.

You describe a lot of interesting VR worlds you created that are now lost. Do you wish you’d preserved them, or is it better that they disappear after a while?

That’s a really good question. Is it good that we’ve lost some of past culture? Would it be worse for us if we preserved every masterpiece from the ancient world? It good that there’s kind of some entropy, when we have a certain amount of memory but we have to make up new things?

There’s actually one of the few surviving videos of an ‘80s virtual world on my website, and it’s of me playing virtual musical instruments of a live performance. When I look at it I think, “Wow, that was actually pretty cool.”

Digital media as a whole is a big problem for preservationists right now.

Of course digital was sold to us back in the day as an infinite memory. Like when something’s digital, it lasts forever; it’s not like paper. But in fact, exactly the opposite is true.

There’s a section of the book on what you call phenotropic computing, which touches a little on how fragile digital systems are.

“We thought we were doing the best possible thing for the world.”

A little bit. Phenotropic computing was the vision I’ve had for virtual reality architecture, and it was this idea for a kind of programming that you could change while it happened. These really ambitious visions for computing tend to obsess a lot of people who’ve been really productive in computer science. We hang onto these things, and we keep on working on them, even as the world settles on what seems like this encrusted mundanity.

Do you imagine starting fresh with them? Like, we shut down the internet and rebuild from the ashes, or set up a parallel system?

I sometimes wonder if that’ll happen. I’ve been actually going through a bit of a crisis of conscience lately, and I think a lot of people in my generation are. In the ‘90s I was the chief scientist of this consortium called Internet2, trying to figure out how to make the internet scalable, and we thought we were doing the best possible thing for the world. And I just wonder, what did we achieve with all this work? All of these lives that were devoted to this thing, and it sometimes seems to be tearing the world apart.

We might have to start over. It might really be that bad. But I really hope not. I really think that if we can just change the financial incentives so that somebody like Facebook is making money from helping people do creative and wonderful valuable things, rather than from being paid to manipulate them by third parties, it might correct itself. I think there’s still hope for that.",VR,Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/8/16751596/jaron-lanier-dawn-of-the-new-everything-vr-interview,"The main undesirable consequence of VR being discussed here is that the perverse financial incentives of the advertising model have corralled people into hostile online groups, creating a wall between people analogous to the physical wall between Mexico and the US.

2,"Empathy, Inc. is a virtual reality thriller for an age of tech cynicism","Here’s a science fiction premise you’ve probably heard before: a person encounters a shadowy company that sells hyper-realistic virtual experiences. They’re put into an incredibly vivid simulated reality through some kind of brainwave helmet or injected drug. Then something goes wrong and the protagonist discovers — say it with me now — that the experience isn’t virtual at all.

The new film Empathy, Inc. is nominally one of these stories. Written by author Mark Leidner and directed by Yedidya Gorsetman, the film premiered at the Cinepocalypse festival in 2018, and it’s getting a wider theatrical release this week. But Empathy, Inc. isn’t playing in the same field as mind-bending trips like David Cronenberg’s film eXistenZ or the Black Mirror episode “Playtest.” It’s a tragedy grounded in the murky world of tech startups and financial hucksterism — a vision of Silicon Valley where everyone is simultaneously a swindler and a mark.

Empathy, Inc.’s protagonist Joel (Zack Robidas) is at a low point in his life. After getting caught in a Theranos-like scandal in Silicon Valley, Joel and his wife Jessica (Kathy Searle) are living with Jessica’s disapproving parents (Fenton Lawless and Charmaine Reedy) in New York. But things start looking up when Joel’s old friend Nicolaus (Eric Berryman) reveals that he’s founded a new startup called Empathy, Inc. The secretive company creates “X-Treme Virtual Reality,” which lets rich users experience the lives of underprivileged people. All Nicolaus and his partner Lester (Jay Klaitz) need is a million dollars to get it off the ground.

Joel wheedles the money from his in-laws, but, unsurprisingly, the startup is hiding a sinister secret. Joel begins to question what’s real — not just in the virtual experiences he’s entering, but in his ordinary life where he’s accused of a cruel act he can’t remember. His wife, a struggling actor, is furious that he’s taken her family’s nest egg. And when Joel desperately tries to turn the tables on Nicolaus, he endangers himself, his family, and everyone involved in Empathy, Inc.

Empathy, Inc. dips lightly into the trippy effects of its powerful technology. Its titular startup evokes the real “empathy machine” genre of VR, which ranges from serious psychological experiments to tone-deaf poverty tourism. (Nicolaus’ goals, it turns out, are even more callous.)

But to Joel and others in the film, what the tech can do is less important than its status as a zeitgeist-y investment opportunity. The film doesn’t portray virtual reality like a science fiction dream or dystopian nightmare, but as the sort of mysterious, buzzword-laden concept that analysts bloviate about alongside “blockchain government” and “the Cloud.” It’s a vicious but recognizable caricature of VR’s place in culture today, not just its futuristic potential.

Empathy, Inc.’s black-and-white cinematography, cynical storyline, and occasional hardboiled repartee give the film a noirish gloss. And a few creepy, evocative ideas pepper the generally short VR sections, like a solemn instruction to “avoid mirrors at all costs.” But the film spends more time on the most unglamorously bourgeois moments of Joel’s life, particularly the hectoring, circular conversations with his in-laws.

Joel is a blandly nice guy who was apparently blindsided by his role in a Silicon Valley fraud scheme. But he refuses to abandon a world that’s based on hype and snake oil, and he’s willing to drag other people down with him. That includes his in-laws, who prize financial success and are thoroughly sick of Jessica’s artsy endeavors and Joel’s squishy sympathy for the economically disadvantaged.

Plenty of science fiction movies are about the very rich exploiting the very poor. Joel and his in-laws fall more realistically in between: successful enough to kick at the people below them, but not rich enough to be fully insulated from their mistakes. Their social striving makes them easy prey for Nicolaus, who Berryman plays as disarmingly personable, and Lester, a nondescript, sullen nerd who unravels into something much darker.

Empathy, Inc. can arguably be too effective at puncturing the mystique of its own world. It’s a slow-burn thriller with characters who are compellingly drawn but hard to root for. Its predictable premise sometimes helps shift the focus toward interpersonal drama, but it makes characters spend too much time figuring out twists that the audience has probably guessed. Only in the last act, as Joel’s life devolves into disaster, does the action speed up enough to match the plot.

Still, Empathy, Inc. uses a classic science fiction premise to explore contemporary tensions about technology and social class. Is the empathy machine ultimately good or bad? It’s never fully clear because Empathy, Inc.’s revolutionary tech is just a smokescreen — it’s money that shapes the world.",VR,Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20851094/empathy-inc-movie-review-virtual-reality-thriller,"In Empathy, Inc., money is ultimately what shapes the world, and the consequences of virtual reality are explored as a result.

3,Virtual Reality’s Missing Element: Other People,"One day I connected with Against Gravity cofounder and chief creative officer Cameron Brown for an interview in the app’s locker room. His avatar was decked out in square purple glasses, a black baseball cap, and a white tank top with an orange Rec Room logo—a simple happy face—on the front. His hand suddenly fell to the ground; the app was having network issues, he said. He whisked me away from the clamor of the locker room to a big, empty lounge with a wood floor, a Ping-Pong table, and couches that our legless bodies couldn’t actually sit on. It’s the rare private space in Rec Room, which anyone can use and invite others into. He said some people have taken to using the space for meetings, and there are a conference table and whiteboards in one corner just for that.

Since VR technology is still so new that most of us don’t have lots of friends using it, and interacting with strangers in virtual reality is about as awkward as doing so in real life, Rec Room is using slightly unconventional methods to get you to socialize. It literally forces you into games. Brown calls it “structured social.” If you and a few others enter the gym around the same time to play dodgeball, for instance, Rec Room’s software will automatically sort everyone into teams and an overly chipper, British-accented woman’s voice will suddenly start counting down the seconds until the match begins. Before you can think about it, you’re thrust into a game. “Who enjoys going to a party where you don’t know anybody, and just walking into a room and going, ‘Hi’?” he said.

True enough. Still, Rec Room’s ice-breaking methods can be jarring at first, like the time I suddenly found myself wielding a giant pen in a game of 3-D charades. Like most people, I do prefer to socialize with those whose interests I share, rather than complete strangers, and that’s not necessarily Rec Room’s aim (although you can set up private games with just your friends). Eventually, though, this sink-or-socialize tactic got me to loosen up and enjoy myself rather than stand around trying to work up the nerve to talk to others. “Even if you’re just mucking around in the locker room throwing darts into other people’s faces, you’ve kind of got a reason to be there, and before you know it, half an hour’s gone by,” Brown said.

Mindless fun or not, Rec Room was remarkable for how it gave me a sense of being in a space with other people, especially my friend who is thousands of miles away. We were giddy at being able to communicate and be together in a new way. It was much more enjoyable than Facebook Spaces, where there’s not enough to do, and another social app, AltspaceVR, where there are too many options for socializing, none very entertaining.

Avatar issues

If you’re hanging out in virtual reality, you’re going to need a body, and what this body must look like, or whether it even has to be human, depends on the context. Often, it seems cartoonish human figures are best for staying clear of the uncanny valley, since it’s still difficult to make avatars look just like us. (Probably the most realistic-looking avatar I’ve yet seen belongs to Second Life creator Philip Rosedale in his new social VR app, High Fidelity, and even that one doesn’t look quite like him.)

Regardless of how well designed your avatar is in VR, one way these worlds resemble real life is that your perceived gender shapes the interactions you have. In Rec Room and other socially geared apps, like AltspaceVR and Facebook Spaces, I prefer to make my avatar female—and preferably similar in appearance to me, with brown hair and, when it’s an option, glasses. Being true to your actual identity can make you feel that your virtual self is authentic, but as a female character you’re likely to face behavior that is obnoxious or worse.

I haven’t experienced anything that bad. The worst was when some whiny, mouth-breathing adolescent boy complained that I sucked at a game: admittedly, it pissed me off and hurt my feelings a bit. (To be fair, I was terrible at several of the games.) But Brown acknowledges that harassment can be an issue. He told me of an incident in which the fiancée of a regular Rec Room user tried out the app and found a bunch of other players instantly in her face when she entered the locker room.

Simple tools to counter these behaviors are critical, but like VR itself, they’re still very much in the experimental stage. Rec Room and AltspaceVR let you mute offensive users or build an invisible cushion around your avatar to make bullies disappear if they get too close. Rec Room also lets players vote on whether someone should be kicked out of a game. These tools will have to get more advanced and intuitive.

It could take several years for headset prices to drop and for a range of apps to figure out the interactions we want to have with each other in virtual spaces, making VR so compelling that, like the TV, PC, and smartphone, it becomes something the average person wants to use. Rec Room is not going to be that killer app for many people. But because it’s focused on certain activities and thoughtful about how to promote social interactions, it’s a good model for what’s possible. I hope it can stick around until there are many more people to play with.",VR,MIT,https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/06/14/150815/virtual-realitys-missing-element-other-people/,"Though VR can provide an immersive, entertaining experience, it also can lead to harassment, as seen in Rec Room and other social VR apps, where female avatars may be subjected to offensive behavior from other players.",Social Norms & Relationships
4,Three big questions about Facebook’s new VR ads,"Yesterday, Facebook took a leap many people have been predicting for years: it started putting ads inside virtual reality. The company launched a limited test of advertisements inside three Oculus Quest apps, saying it would expand the system based on user feedback. The move is a turning point for Oculus, bringing one of Facebook’s most controversial features into a medium that inspires both idealism and alarm. And it raises three big questions about Facebook’s future and immersive computing.

The first question is how deeply Facebook will end up linking advertising with hardware sensor data. Even more than smartphones, Oculus Quest headsets are a gold mine of information about you. They capture precise head and hand motion, pictures of your surroundings through tracking cameras, and microphone audio for Facebook’s voice command system. Future headsets will likely include even more intimate features like eye tracking, which would offer incredibly precise metrics on what captures your attention in VR.

Right now, Facebook says much of this data either never leaves your headset or is completely segmented from its advertising system, and it says it has “no plans” to do things like target ads based on movement data. But as Facebook moves deeper into virtual and augmented reality, using its hardware’s special features for advertising will become an increasingly attractive prospect.

Immersive computing is a gold mine of intimate data

Facebook is reportedly working on a fitness tracker and has discussed building AR glasses that you’ll use to interact with the world. These products are custom-built to produce quantifiable insights about your body and surroundings, and it’s hard to believe Facebook doesn’t have plans to monetize that — even if Facebook Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth has said the company is “not really focused on business model” questions for experimental hardware. Oculus is Facebook’s first big test case for advertising on its own computing device, and as it expands ads on VR and other hardware, we’ll see how it handles the wealth of new data types it’s collecting.

The second question is how ads will affect VR development. Several of the bestselling VR titles right now feel like substantive console or PC games and sell at a similar price. By contrast, it’s not yet clear which app genres work well with an ad-based model. (Blaston, the first game we know includes ads, is a multiplayer dueling game that you play in short competitive bouts.) Whatever those genres are, Facebook just created an incentive to make a lot more of them, since developers get a cut of the revenue involved.

It’s easy to imagine dystopian scenarios like a huge library of attention-grabbing but low-quality games and social apps plastered with pop-ups, or the seizure-inducing corporate hellscape from Ready Player One. It doesn’t help that Facebook’s first tests look like flat banner ads from a website or freeware game. That said, Facebook is notoriously picky about what goes into the Quest library and there’s no indication that will change soon.

We also don’t know VR advertising’s final form. Facebook says it’s currently exploring “new ad formats that are unique to VR.” It didn’t specify what that looked like, but for one nontraditional ad platform, we could look at Fortnite — a popular virtual world from a studio with an impeccable gaming pedigree, and one of the most effective ad delivery systems in the modern cultural landscape. (A system where players pay to promote the intellectual property of multinational media conglomerates is possibly also dystopian, but in a way most people seem okay with.) Modern consumer VR headsets have been full of ads since practically the beginning, thanks to promotional tie-ins and sponsorships. Yesterday’s news was just the latest iteration of a long-running trend.

What does a good ad-supported VR app look like?

This iteration, though, has a big Facebook-shaped wrinkle. The Quest ads are served based on data from your Facebook profile, and Facebook’s hyper-personalization is one of its most controversial features — criticized in general as a tool for social division and more specifically for enabling discrimination. Beyond any larger social effects, if you’re sharing a headset with friends and family, it could feel simply invasive to have them see what Facebook thinks you’re into. You can add multiple accounts to a Quest headset, but the feature is experimental and it’s not clear how many users know about it.

And that raises the third question: how will Facebook and its critics address general concerns about “Big Tech” in the realm of VR? Should Facebook, for example, ban specific kinds of ads — or methods of ad delivery — from appearing in headsets? And should consumer protection watchdogs look specifically at how ads work inside the Oculus platform, which they’ve largely ignored when scrutinizing Facebook?

It wasn’t hard to see these debates coming. Facebook has wanted to own the next computing platform for years, and its vision of computing relies a lot on advertising. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey once promised that Oculus wouldn’t “flash ads at you” inside VR, but he (along with Oculus’ other early executives) left the company years ago. Bosworth said in 2015 that the Oculus experience “should include ads, because life includes ads.”

But Facebook says it’s not just barreling ahead with a long-held master plan — instead, it promises it’s looking at feedback as it moves forward with VR advertising. As VR gets closer to Facebook’s core business, Quest users and developers will get to see if the company keeps that promise.",VR,Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22537349/facebook-vr-oculus-quest-ads-privacy-questions-analysis,"Facebook's introduction of ads into virtual reality raises concerns about the potential for intrusive data collection, the risk of low-quality games and apps that might be plastered with ads, and the potential for discriminatory targeting based on data from the headset.",Security & Privacy
5,Zuckerberg apologizes for his tone-deaf VR cartoon tour of Puerto Rico devastation – TechCrunch,"Mark Zuckerberg is apologizing today after his Facebook Live video discussing his company’s efforts to aid Puerto Rico’s recovery raised some serious eyebrows.

Yesterday, Zuckerberg used the company’s VR app Spaces to tour through an NPR-produced 360 video of Puerto Rico. Zuck’s cartoon avatar directed attention towards various features of Puerto Rico’s destruction while another Facebook executive remarked “it’s crazy to feel like you’re in the middle of it.”

The video induced quite a few cringes as the tech billionaire visited Puerto Rico’s destruction inside virtual reality as a cartoon.

“Do you want to teleport somewhere else?” Zuckerberg’s VR avatar asked as he wrapped up his conversation about Puerto Rico. “Yeah maybe back to California?” another executive answered.

Zuckerberg reacted to some of the backlash in a reply to a Facebook comment on the video.

One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what’s happening in different parts of the world. I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with the Red Cross to help with the recovery. Reading some of the comments, I realize this wasn’t clear, and I’m sorry to anyone this offended.

To be fair, it really is difficult to represent experiences in VR to third parties and all Zuckerberg was seeing was the harrowing video from NPR, not necessarily what it looked like as his cartoonish avatar grabbed the camera to peruse the damage. That being said, the tone-deafness of the video was pretty pronounced and even though the content of his video pointed to all of the positive work Facebook was doing in Puerto Rico, seeing a couple of cartoons chatting about it in VR have made the executives appear pretty out of touch.

“When you’re in VR yourself, the surroundings feel quite real. But that sense of empathy doesn’t extend well to people watching you as a virtual character on a 2D screen. That’s something we’ll need to work on over time,” Zuckerberg said in another comment he left.

Facebook is generally pretty careful to isolate its CEO from opportunities for bad press, Zuckerberg has an extensive team helping him maintain his manicured public image on the social media site. With tools like Facebook Live that demand less scripted moments, this level of media-training can stutter, especially when you don’t have the advantage of seeing an outside view of what exactly you look like while it’s all going down.

Regardless, someone should’ve known better.

Facebook specifically chose a fun, vibrant cartoon-like mood for their VR Spaces app so that users wouldn’t feel intimidated by the control scheme.

6,Facebook is making Oculus’ worst feature unavoidable,"Yesterday, Facebook infuriated the VR world, announcing plans to require a Facebook login for future VR headsets. The decision broke an early promise from Oculus founder Palmer Luckey and was almost universally reviled online, with critics raising concerns about intrusive data collection, targeted advertising, and being forced to use a service they hated. On the Oculus subreddit, some users posted bitter memes about Farmville and data harvesting, while others swapped recommendations for other headsets. One posted a cartoon of Oculus as a sinking ship.

The truth is probably a lot less dire. Facebook-related boycotts fizzle all the time — when it acquired Oculus in 2014, Minecraft creator Markus “Notch” Persson furiously killed a deal to put his game on Oculus Rift, only to be “officially over being upset” months later. (Minecraft was sold to Microsoft and appeared on the Rift soon after its launch.) And Oculus presents plenty of other benefits that could overcome skeptics’ distaste.

But Facebook is also stoking controversy during a deep scrutiny of its acquisitions and privacy practices. Even if its decision works for many users, it’s causing real concern particularly at the margins of VR — a small industry where the margins really matter.

Facebook already owned the data Oculus collects

There’s one major argument against a mass Oculus exodus: while yesterday’s change causes problems for a small group of headset owners, many won’t notice much difference. Facebook has real privacy issues, and VR produces vast amounts of data about your movement and surroundings. But Facebook already owned that data. Facebook can see if you’re using a Facebook and Oculus account from the same IP address, whether or not they’re linked. Buying any Oculus app with a credit card requires sharing as much sensitive data as a bare-bones Facebook profile. If you’re a home VR user, Facebook is just spotlighting a privacy trade-off people have been making for years.

Despite a wave of posts about people selling their Oculus Quest headsets, the odds seem stacked against a consumer revolt. There’s no mass deactivation to focus anger into coordinated action since separate accounts will work until 2023, although Oculus says “all future unreleased devices” will require a Facebook account. The change apparently doesn’t affect Oculus for Business customers either, and businesses are a bigger and more stable market than consumers.

Developers need all the headset users they can find

What about developers? Oculus needs popular apps to attract users, and some designers say forced Facebook integration is a deal-breaker. “I deactivated my Facebook account earlier this year, and don’t plan on devving for Quest / Oculus ever again,” Blarp! creator Isaac Cohen (who works under the name Cabbibo) told me on Twitter after the announcement.

But dropping Oculus is a serious sacrifice. Developers need the biggest audience they can get, which means releasing across all VR platforms. Oculus is one of a few companies backing VR game development at a large scale. The standalone Oculus Quest is one of VR’s most popular headsets — and with good reason, given its versatility, solid design, and a robust catalog of Facebook-owned games. As Ben Kuchera of Polygon writes, the Quest is “great video games and great hardware ... owned and controlled by the one company I would want to keep as far away from the technology as possible.”

Facebook has weathered bigger furors over clearer harms, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal’s #DeleteFacebook campaign and an advertiser boycott over hate speech. Add this to all the factors above, and it’s highly plausible that the login controversy will blow over.

But Oculus is also more vulnerable than Facebook as a whole. Facebook is an incredibly sticky and ubiquitous service; it mediated the jobs, social lives, and relationships of 2.5 billion people in early 2020. Oculus headset numbers are scant, but they’re estimated in the millions, toward the top of a very small market. The company’s success still hinges on having the best hardware and software experience, not just an overwhelming incumbent advantage.

Oculus’ competitors have seized on this controversy. HTC’s Vive Twitter account jumped into the Oculus announcement thread and pitched the Vive Cosmos headset to angry VR fans. Joanna Popper, HP’s head of VR, boasted that the upcoming Reverb G2 would be “no Facebook account needed.” Oculus competitors like Valve, which runs a cross-platform storefront, can earn money off almost anybody with a PC headset. But the Oculus Store is Rift- and Quest-only, so every hardware sale it loses is a lost software customer as well.

Lawmakers have questioned Oculus privacy policies before

If Facebook is extremely unlucky, this controversy puts Oculus in regulators’ crosshairs. Lawmakers have questioned Oculus’ privacy policies before, and investigators are currently poring over past Facebook acquisitions for evidence that the company is abusing its power and collecting unconscionable amounts of user data. There’s also a newfound enthusiasm for splitting up tech giants. Spinning off a VR headset division is probably low on reformers’ priority list, but rousing data privacy fears around an acquired company doesn’t exactly help Facebook.

Oculus is a small part of Facebook: even after the company’s non-advertising revenue spiked in early 2020, that money equaled less than 2 percent of its ad revenue. But VR enthusiasts worry that a backlash could shrink the whole industry.

Requiring Facebook integration hurts extremely privacy-conscious users that avoid the Oculus Store, and it removes a formal layer of data separation that many people (including me) appreciate. Facebook is making yet-unexplained privacy policy changes too. Facebook will be fine if a few thousand alienated Quest owners stop buying software, but even small losses could knock out indie developers with razor-thin margins. The Quest is one of the only headsets that doesn’t require a gaming PC or console, and even if HTC or Sony nab some disillusioned would-be Oculus hardware customers, others may just decide to stay away.

“This is a practical nightmare.”

Facebook integration also makes non-personal Quest use more difficult. “My own Facebook gripes aside, this is a practical nightmare for those of us who administer shared devices in schools and libraries,” wrote Northwestern University Knight Lab member Rebecca Poulson on Twitter. An Oculus spokesperson says organizations can use Oculus for Business and implement their own login systems. But the more inconvenient using a headset becomes, the more likely these niche user bases will wither — and in the current VR industry, every headset counts.

Facebook’s login change is especially frustrating because it seemingly offers users so little. People who want Facebook-specific features can already get them. Some headset owners buy deeply into the platform’s full ecosystem, but others rely on third-party stores like Steam, and this change only antagonizes them. Facebook says centralization will help create a simpler moderation process, but it’s not clear why that can’t be streamlined internally instead.

In its announcement, Facebook said the majority of Oculus users already log in with a Facebook account. So it may be worth the backlash to encourage greater social engagement or avoid maintaining two separate account systems. But it’s also one of the persistent reminders that Oculus’ success — achieved at least partly with Facebook’s money and connections — has come at a cost.

8,Sen. Franken wants to know what Oculus is doing with its Rift user data – TechCrunch,"Sen. Franken wants to know what Oculus is doing with its Rift user data

Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) has some questions for Oculus.

The U.S. senator sent a letter this morning to Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe to inquire about how his virtual reality company is utilizing and sharing customers’ personal data.

While Sen. Franken called VR technology “an exciting development,” he also expressed concern with how the company is collecting users’ personal data through the headset and its associated services. This letter, he said, is intended to help people “understand the extent to which Oculus may be collecting Americans’ personal information, including sensitive location data, and sharing that information with third parties.”

Numerous complaints from users and media outlets have arisen over the past week regarding specific language within the Terms of Service (ToS) for the Rift. From seemingly creepy stipulations that the company reserves the rights to collect user movement data, to the always-on gathering of user data, there have been a great deal of pertinent questions that the company has stayed relatively quiet on.

Oculus did clarify to Gizmodo earlier this week that language in the ToS was being misconstrued in regards to ownership rights of user-created content, but didn’t respond to other concerns.

“Users and content developers own all the content and IP they create using Oculus services. We are not taking ownership. Our terms of service give Oculus a license to user created content so we can enable a full suite of current and future products and services on our platform, like sharing a piece of VR content with a friend.”

Franken’s individual questions largely focus on some of the more vague sets of language in the ToS regarding user data being gathered and shared. He asks Iribe about how user location data, physical movement data and communication data are utilized and how long the information is retained. Furthermore, Franken presses the company to disclose what precautions are being taken to protect these selections of user data.

One word that is notably absent from the letter is “Facebook.” Though Oculus, like Instagram, operates as a unique company under Facebook, there have been more than a fair share of privacy concerns regarding how information is shared between the VR company and the social media giant. Franken does not directly call out Facebook in this letter to Iribe, but he does frequently refer to Oculus’ “related companies.”

Virtual reality as a technological platform raises more ethical questions than the average piece of hardware, thus, some of these early consumer products are understandably drawing major scrutiny. Sen. Franken seems to want Oculus to set a precedent of transparency while virtual reality is still in its early stages.

I believe Americans have a fundamental right to privacy, and that right includes an individual s access to information about what data are being collected about them, how the data are being treated, and with whom the data are being shared. As virtual reality technology evolves, I ask that you provide more information on Rift and how Oculus is addressing issues of privacy and security.

The senator ends his letter with a request that the company responds to his list of questions by May 13 of this year. Franken has had a history of pressing tech companies for transparency in regards to their usages of users’ personal data. Hopefully a response from Oculus can allay some user concerns or highlight areas in the company’s current Terms of Service that may need some adjustment.

Franken’s letter and questions.",VR,TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/07/sen-franken-wants-to-know-what-oculus-is-doing-with-its-rift-user-data/,"Sen.

9,"You Perceive Time Differently in Virtual Reality, Scientists Say","It’s easy to lose track of time when you allow yourself to get carried away while playing video games — but intriguingly, that effect appears to be far more noticeable when gaming in virtual reality.

A team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, found that time flies by when playing while wearing a VR headset as compared to playing the same game on a two-dimensional screen.

In an experiment, as detailed in a paper published in the journal Timing & Time Perception, research assistant Grayson Mullen and psychology professor Nicolas Davidenko found that participants had a much harder time gauging how fast time passed when playing a game in VR.

Participants playing the same game — a simplified maze puzzle — on a screen in front of them were good at estimating when they believed five minutes had passed without access to a clock.

Those playing in VR, though, played for an average of 72.6 seconds longer before signaling to the researchers when they believed five minutes had passed.

“This is the first time we can really isolate that it’s not just that you’re playing a video game, or the content of whatever you’re seeing,” Mullen said in a statement. “It’s really the fact that it is virtual reality versus a conventional screen that contributes to this time compression effect.”

As its name suggests, time compression is the effect when time goes by faster than we think.

The researchers suggest that the effect could be the result of the fact that you are less aware of your physical body inside VR.

“In virtual reality, when you look down, you might see nothing where your body normally would be, or you might see a schematic of a body, but it won’t feel like your body,” Davidenko, co-author of the paper, said in the statement.

“There are theories that we may rely on our heartbeat and other bodily rhythms to help our brain track the passage of time, so if you have a less vivid sense of your body in virtual reality, you might be missing the pulses of this timekeeping mechanism.”

It’s an exciting conclusion, but any results should be taken with a grain of salt. There’s still a lot we don’t know about “time compression” and Mullen’s experiment is also not bulletproof.

For instance, participants were asked to play the game in both VR and on a conventional screen, one after the other, with the order being picked at random. Time compression only occurred for those who played the game in VR first.

That means participants may have made their best guess during the second round based on the estimation in the first round, as the researchers note in their paper.

If the effect holds up more generally, though, losing yourself inside virtual reality could also have some negative consequences.

“As virtual reality headsets get more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time, and as more immersive games are made for this format, I think it would be good to avoid having it become like a virtual casino, where you end up playing more because you don’t realize how much time you’re spending,” Mullen said in the statement.

In any event, virtual reality has proven time and time again that it can be incredibly immersive — a quality that comes with its own risks and rewards.

10,User succumbs to a seizure in virtual reality while other players can only watch,"While playing around in VRChat, an online virtual community, YouTuber Rogue Shadow VR noticed a player who appeared to be in trouble. His character — a red and black robot — was writhing on the floor and gasping in what appeared to be an epileptic seizure.

In the original video, spotted by Motherboard, Rogue Shadow VR explains that because the player had full body tracking, those in the online room were suddenly bystanders to his real-life dilemma. “There was no way we could tell at first, because all we see is this character he’s playing as,” Rogue Shadow VR says. VRChat is a strange platform to begin with, one where players can appear as any avatar they make, from pokémon and Rick & Morty characters to imagery from problematic memes. It’s typical for players to goof off or otherwise act out of turn.

But players soon realized that this incident was not a prank, but a person experiencing real distress. Many asked aloud “Is he ok?” while others wondered what to do. Without knowing who the person was, however, there was little they could do but watch. Eventually, the player began to recover and respond to their questions, while they tried to comfort him. Although online spaces can be notoriously hostile, especially within the gaming community, the majority of players seemed genuinely concerned when confronted with the reality of a person in trouble. While a few ignored the seizing player or continued making jokes, most voiced their concern and care. “Be safe,” one says as the player logs off. Many seem shaken after the incident.

“there was nothing we could do”

A full version of the incident without commentary has since been uploaded to Rogue Shadow VR’s channel. According to Rogue Shadow VR, both videos have been uploaded with the permission of the player in question.

“This video is being shared for the purposes of spreading awareness of epilepsy which must be considered with the emergence of virtual reality on both the industry and individual users scale,” the video’s description says. “This is also being shared for the purpose of analyzing and documenting the nature of this occurrence and the reactions of bystanders in Virtual Reality which is an unprecedented situation.” Rogue Shadow VR says he caught up with the player afterwards on Steam, and that he is doing better now.

Virtual reality opens up more physical interactions and relationships than any other online space has before, though it typically masks people’s faces and physical locations. Although players may be able to see someone in trouble, there’s really no way to help them.

“It was definitely interesting to see the way people could come together and show concern for somebody they don’t know, but at the same time it was really weird because there was nothing we could do,” Rogue Shadow VR says. “We didn’t even know what part of the planet this person lived on. All we could do was observe.”",VR,Verge,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/19/16911408/vr-chat-virtual-reality-seizure,"The unfortunate consequence of virtual reality highlighted by this incident is the difficulty of providing help in online spaces, as players may not be able to tell who is in trouble or where they are located.

11,The reality of VR porn – TechCrunch,"Tech and porn are intimately connected. The porn industry has been an early adopter of new tech time and time again, and virtual reality is just the latest tech star the industry wants to get into bed with.

Investment bank and asset management firm Piper Jaffray estimates that by 2025 porn will be the third-largest VR sector (after video games and NFL-related content). In a racket like this, the guiding doctrine must be: The more realistic, the better, right? But in virtual reality, maybe caution is advisable.

Several prominent psychologists have raised concerns about the implications of adult entertainment becoming more and more like the “real thing.”

And therein lies the first misperception: The kind of sexual activity portrayed in pornography isn’t all that realistic to begin with. “Because it’s professed as becoming increasingly like the ‘real thing,’ porn literacy is more important than ever,” Marty Klein, author of, His Porn, Her Pain: Confronting America’s PornPanic with Honest Talk About Sex, told me. “Consumers of porn — and their partners — need to understand how it’s made, and how what’s portrayed is not what real sex is like.”

Won’t somebody think of the children?

VR porn may still be new, but it is quickly moving mainstream, thanks in no small part to companies like Samsung and Oculus Rift (owned by Facebook) developing more affordable headsets that work with the VR video content being provided free of charge on adult sites such as PornHub.

It is without question a more intimate pornographic experience than the traditional voyeuristic perspective from a magazine or DVD.

Using a Homido VR headset with my iPhone 5 clipped to the front, I “sampled” various online VR porn videos. The number of options still seems fairly limited, especially when you consider a site like PornHub carries more than three million videos alone. But the experience, even on a VR smartphone headset, was still pretty impressive.

UCLA’s Professor Neil Malamuth has been studying the effects of pornography for decades. He recently sampled VR porn for the first time, too. “I was most surprised by the extent to which the video felt more personal than any conventional porn I’d viewed before,” he told me. “You get a far greater sense that you are in the room with a woman and she is talking directly to you and looking you straight in the eye,” he said. “This naturally appeals on a more personal level than traditional videos, which have a voyeuristic quality.”

But all that eye contact and direct communication is a one-sided transmission. And when fiction gets that close, you start hoping it’s real — or at the very least like a “choose your own adventure” story.

Such a convincing level of faux-intimacy, therefore, couldn’t be without some psychological or social implications.

I believe the fear of VR porn is simply more technophobia as we’ve seen so many times in the past. Dr. David Ley

In an interview he gave earlier this year, Malamuth compared the effects of porn with alcohol. “If you asked me, ‘Is alcohol good or bad?’ the answer is, well it depends. For some people it’s really bad — people whose lives have been ruined by alcohol consumption. For others, it’s neutral or it might allow them to de-stress, and make their sex life more interesting. I think the research shows similar conclusions for pornography depending on the cultural context, the individual factors, the amount consumed, and other features of a person’s life.”

Following on from this logic, the impact of VR porn will also vary between individuals. As the experience becomes more realistic and certain elements are accentuated, there could be negative side effects, particularly for men already at risk of committing sexual aggression. “For this substantial at-risk minority, porn tends to add fuel to the fire,” Malamuth said.

On the flip side, the illusion of intimacy portrayed though VR may in fact lead to more satisfying sexual experiences for others, without necessarily having negative effects. “For some it may become a preferred form of sexual experience that is more physically and psychologically satisfying than having sex with a real partner,” he added.

Society has a long history of wild, groundless speculation when it comes to assessing the merits, or otherwise, of any new tech on the horizon. (At the turn of the 20th century, many in the medical profession believed bicycles turned women into lesbians.)

So not everyone agrees that VR is any more significant a medium than the postcards, magazines, videotapes or DVDs that came before it. “I believe the fear of VR porn is simply more technophobia as we’ve seen so many times in the past,” clinical psychologist Dr. David Ley, author of Ethical Porn for Dicks: A Man’s Guide to Responsible Viewing Pleasure, told me. Just like the fear that bicycle seats would turn women into lesbians, there have also been concerns over vibrators and how they could make women lose interest in men. People in Utah believe internet porn will herald the end of the institution of marriage entirely.

“It’s doubtful that many people will pursue VR porn who don’t already pursue adult videos more generally,” Ley added. “In fact VR porn may flop as it requires viewers to be more active in situations where many are actually seeking a passive sexual experience.”

There is one pretty novel aspect to this technology, however, which does separate it somewhat from porn’s more primitive guises of days gone by. VR technology can enable users to switch roles so they can view things from the perspective of their sexual partner. For example, a man may switch his viewpoint to have a woman’s body or vice versa. “You look down and suddenly see what is your pretty vagina and beautiful legs,” explained Malamuth. “It’s a totally new experience, which could be very disturbing for some people. Others, however, might appreciate it for opening up brave new dimensions to their own sexuality and sensuality.”",VR,TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/20/the-reality-of-vr-porn/,"VR porn could have potentially negative psychological and social implications, as it creates an illusion of intimacy that may lead to more satisfying sexual experiences for some, but also increase the risk of sexual aggression for those already at-risk.",Social Norms & Relationships
12,Virtual Trolls,"One powerful thing about virtual reality is the way it lets you stand “face to face” with other people—sometimes people from the other side of the world who you’d never otherwise meet. People in social VR settings really tend to connect. I’ve seen people meet and become friends in VR and then continue the friendship in real life. I’ve seen people meet their significant others in virtual reality.

But this only works when people appear as their real selves. And one huge problem with social interactions in virtual reality is the degree of anonymity we’re finding there. It can alienate people who would otherwise be interested in giving social VR a try.

People using anonymity or maintaining a little more privacy isn’t always bad—a shy person might feel able to shake off awkwardness and adopt a more easygoing personality, for example. But what we see too often among the anonymous is bad behavior. With no real name or face it becomes easy to treat people in a critical or abusive way.

We are in the early stages of VR, much like the Internet in the 1990s. There are no rules and no law of the land. We are all learning what is okay and what isn’t. And as in those early Internet days, we’re learning that anonymity causes a degree of chaos and undesirable behaviors. It removes accountability. Anonymity lets people bully others without repercussions.

There’s no simple solution to the problem. Improvements in the areas of friend connections, avatars, and interaction design have helped, but haven’t solved it. App creators can help by creating clear standards, including repercussions for bad behavior. Benefits such as customized avatars, extra capabilities, and new features might help coax people to come out of the shadows and engage more authentically.

Whatever we try, it will be worth the effort. Social VR lets people connect and communicate in a way that’s much more natural, more effective, and richer in context than current methods of communicating over a long distance. I’d like people to think about VR as a place you can go to express yourself authentically and connect with others. Within that space there’s fantastic potential for education, business, science, art, and entertainment. Anonymity kills that potential.

We’d like to make an apology for the concerns it might have raised,” it said in a statement printed by The Wall Street Journal, which reached out with questions about Vivi.

Vivi, which was in beta testing, was announced in March as a “built-in AI ‘girlfriend’” and virtual assistant for iQiyi’s new Qiyu VR headset. Beyond acting as a basic voice interface, it was supposed to “read people's moods through emotion recognition technology” and “intelligently select and recommend movies by interacting with her users.” But according to the Journal, users also praised its ability to flirt and “perform sexy dances,” with one screenshot showing a user groping Vivi’s breast. The South China Morning Post recently profiled the product, quoting a fan whose relationship with Vivi was “like role-playing a domineering boss and his secretary.”

Most well-known virtual assistants from other companies are coded as female by default, which already links femininity with subservience.
