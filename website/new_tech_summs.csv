0,Puzzle Your Way Out of Certain Death as a VR Special Agent,"I Expect You To Die is a virtual reality puzzle game tour de force.

The game is inspired by Goldfinger's immortal verbal riposte to 007, ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die,"" and puts you in the kind of potentially deadly, if thoroughly cartoonish, situations James might find himself in. Locked in a booby-trapped automobile inside the cargo hold of an airplane that's about to crash, f'rinstance. To survive, you must observe your environment and manipulate the objects at hand to find your way out.

Strewn about are tools that you can use in a variety of ways, but also instructions and other nudging hints that guide you to solutions. I spent a little time with the game at the Oculus event at the Game Developer's Conference, and I like its no-nonsense attitude towards the puzzles: This is not a hand-holdy experience, and you will fall victim to the traps before you escape.

You have the power of telekinesis, because why not, and because it allows developer Schell Games to leave you in a seated, stationary position while also letting you access everything in the room. So inside that car, you might need to find a screwdriver to unscrew a panel on the dashboard, but said screwdriver is outside of the car.

You roll down the window, letting poisonous gas waft into the car. Grab the screwdriver using mind power (which merely involves using the analog stick on the Oculus Touch controller) and roll the window up before the gas fills the car. You've probably screwed this up, so now you're dead. That isn't so bad, because the biggest challenge of the game is figuring out what to do, not actually doing it. A minute or so later, you'll have rushed through the puzzle bits you've already spent half an hour figuring out, and be right back at the beginning.

The car thing, which is available as a demo if you have an Oculus dev kit, is fairly easy to get through. The second level shown here at GDC is much tougher---you're at the evil villain's desk, trying to find, then destroy, his latest death-dealing contraption. This mission requires a great deal of observation and thought---there's a safe with a secret code that's not immediately obvious, many sheets of paper that explain how to work the machines you find, and a whole heck of a lot of stuff strewn about that might be red herrings or might be incredibly important.

Death is a temporary setback, inattention is the real killer. Expect to spend a lot of time in the Oculus as you poke your way through these brainteasers. I had a blast with the demo; as a certified IRL escape-room nut I can't wait to get shot, blown up, gassed, and otherwise murdered over and over once I Expect You To Die is ready to roll.","The potential for people to get so engrossed in the game that they neglect their real-world responsibilities. It's possible that people could lose track of time while playing and neglect to eat or drink, or forget to take care of their hygiene. In more extreme cases, people might play for so long that they miss appointments or neglect to take care of their pets. It's also possible that people might become so immersed in the game that they start to believe that the virtual world is reality, and this could lead to some serious mental health issues.",https://www.wired.com/2016/03/i-expect-you-to-die-vr-game/,2016-03-16 14:00:35+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9964144229888916,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
1,The Nauseating Disappointment of Oculus Rift,"And when things don’t work just right, VR can literally make you ill, or at least uncomfortable. Some issues can pop up with the hardware itself, like visual jittering. Others relate to the ways content is made—things like rapid acceleration and deceleration can make you feel sick because what you see isn’t matching up with what your body feels.

To get a more thorough look at this, I tried a variety of games and other experiences with different ratings (Oculus places the ones in its store in three categories: “comfortable,” “moderate,” and “intense”), like BlazeRush, where I raced cars around a track, and Bazaar, where I rode a flying carpet around a bazaar, collecting food and coins and avoiding hungry crocodiles, annoying monkeys, and fearsome snakes. I watched short films, like Invasion!, and I tried out environmental explorations like Ocean Rift.

I was happy to realize that Oculus’s rating system is pretty accurate. Games and other experiences rated “general” were typically playable for a while without feeling sick or otherwise uncomfortable. Games rated “moderate,” like the sci-fi shooter Gunjack, were a bit of a step up in terms of intensity. And playing games rated “intense” was much, much harder. In less than 10 minutes I had to stop and take off the headset, and I felt ill for a while afterward, too.

Situations where I could control my velocity—and where things weren’t moving swiftly around me—seemed to work much better. On a virtual trip through the Grand Canyon, for instance, I could pick between three kayak speeds as I passed red rocks, water lilies, and ducked under a rushing waterfall. I spent 20 minutes just looking at the scenery; it felt almost meditative.

And that was largely my limit—after about 20 minutes, I might not feel sick, but my eyes and brain needed a break. That might be enough for short games and films, but would make it a lot harder to, say, watch a feature-length movie in VR or, perhaps one day, use the technology for work as a virtual desktop with endless displays.

I asked Evan Suma, a research assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies who studies VR, what this means for widespread adoption of the technology. Hardcore gamers, after all, are fond of playing console games on flat screens for hours on end, and gaming is expected to be a huge early market for the latest VR headsets; does it matter if people can’t use it for very long?

Suma thinks it’s a concern for widespread adoption, saying simulator sickness is “one of the biggest challenges” that the VR community needs to solve.

The Oculus Rift virtual reality headset.

He wonders, however, if we may adjust to wearing headsets over time, making it more comfortable to wear them for longer. This is a theory Oculus founder Palmer Luckey believes in; while he acknowledges sickness is still an issue that needs to be solved by game design, he has also said that he thinks people will adjust to VR technology. I noticed it myself, actually, as I continued playing Bazaar over a couple days and found myself less affected by sudden turns of my flying carpet.

Whether or not we can naturally adjust, there are ways to help fix discomfort in VR. Suma says these range from using teleportation to move you from one point to another in virtual space to giving you a larger area to physically move around in while in virtual reality (right now, the Vive headset is more suited for this than the Rift). Eventually, advancements in display technology may improve things, too.

Making lighter headsets could help as well. The Rift weighs about a pound; the Vive weighs slightly more. That may not sound that heavy, especially when you consider the kinds of headsets used for VR in the past, but Suma says research indicates that the more weight you put on your head the more inertia you have when turning it, which means it takes more effort to stop turning and, as a result, some people feel sick.

Improvements like these will take a while, but I’m willing to wait: when you do get a truly immersive virtual-reality experience, like some of the ones I had, it’s riveting—even in 20-minute increments. In the meantime, I’ll be spending my non-nauseous time in the Oculus Rift shuffling between my kayak and flying carpet.","It can make people sick.

2,Another Price Slash Suggests the Oculus Rift Is Dead in the Water,"For the next six weeks, the Oculus Rift headset and its matching controllers will cost just $399. That’s $400 less than when it first hit the market, and $200 less than when its price was first slashed in March. It means that the Rift now costs less than the package offered by its cheapest rival, Sony, whose PlayStation VR currently totals $460 including headset and controllers.

Even so, it’s not clear that it will be enough to lure people into buying a Rift. A year ago, our own Rachel Metz predicted that the Rift would struggle against Sony’s offering because the former requires a powerful (and expensive) gaming computer to run, while the latter needs just a $350 PlayStation 4 game console.","Virtual reality has been praised for its ability to immerse users in other worlds and provide them with new experiences. However, the technology also has some unintended consequences. One of the most significant is its potential to isolate users from the real world.

Many people who use virtual reality headsets report feeling cut off from the outside world and becoming more engaged with the virtual world than the real one. This can lead to users feeling isolated from their friends and family and feeling less connected to the real world. Additionally, virtual reality can also cause nausea and dizziness in some users, which can further contribute to the feeling of isolation.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/07/10/68156/another-price-slash-suggests-the-oculus-rift-is-dead-in-the-water/,2017-07-10 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9953208565711976,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,User Experience & Entertainment
3,EVE Online Gamers Role-Play as Covid-19 Researchers,"They know all about saving fictional worlds, but gamers are now being called upon by researchers to lend a hand in one of humankind's biggest crises—the Covid-19 pandemic. So far, they have risen to the occasion and delivered the equivalent of 471 years of work.

In the multiplayer space opera EVE Online, a mini-game called Project Discovery doubles as a citizen science platform, studying the human immune system’s response to the novel coronavirus. Participants take on data analysis through gameplay that helps researchers isolate specific patterns as predictors of disease severity.

The project is a collaboration with McGill University, the British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. To design the citizen science component, EVE Online developer CCP Games worked with Massively Multiplayer Online Science (MMOS), a Swiss company that connects scientific research with games to build a seamless gaming experience. According to a CCP Games spokesperson, there are 426,000 players participating in the Covid-19 mini-game right now, and they have completed 1.8 million analysis tasks since the project’s launch in June 2020.

“Multiplayer games, more games in general, need to incorporate citizen science … To take some of that and use it for some greater scientific good is a big challenge for the entire industry.” Bergur Finnbogason, creative director of EVE Online

In the highly competitive MMORPG space, getting and retaining players is a never-ending challenge. For citizen science projects, says Bergur Finnbogason, creative director of EVE Online, retaining players is critical. Unlike distributed computing programs like SETI@Home, which need mass computing power, projects like these need human input. And for that you need players who return to play again and again.

Despite falling figures, EVE Online remains popular as one of the longest-running online multiplayer games—it predates World of Warcraft by a year and a half, and has been called “peerless.” Its immense universe, called New Eden, comprises almost 8,000 star systems. Gameplay is essentially a DIY space opera, where players—called capsuleers—embark on epic space missions that encompass exploration, mining, industry, and more. Plus, there’s plenty of piracy, as well as no-holds-barred PvP and PvE battles. In between vying for cosmic riches and glory, capsuleers can also take time to boost critical research processes on Earth via Project Discovery. In return, they are rewarded with unique in-game goodies, like exclusive apparel and facial augmentations, not to mention the honor of having a hand in real-world scientific breakthroughs.

In Project Discovery’s latest mission, players help scientists study the impact of Covid-19 on our immune systems by analyzing the blood of infected individuals for disease markers. “We basically built an interface with scientific servers … [through which] you can swap out the data [into the game],” says Finnbogason. Players have to find and mark cell clusters in the blood of infected Covid-19 patients using a tracing tool.

“Oftentimes, it’s really easy to see big and dense clustering,” he says, “but when things become very sparse, that’s where the money lies, in a way.” Multiple players work on the same data sets to reach consensus about the specific areas of interest. Once the data sets are sent back to the research lab and verified, a higher-resolution cross-section of the area is fed back into the game for players to look at again.

The process helps scientists pinpoint the areas they need to look at more closely to understand infection in different cell populations and types. The contribution of gamers, says David Ecker, production director for EVE Online, helps cut down a ton of data-crunching tasks that scientists would otherwise have to do. Considering that there are significantly fewer scientists compared to gamers, he adds, “we can just skip them ahead so many working years of time, so they [only] look at samples that our players have deemed worth looking at.”

The data submitted by citizen scientists won’t just help researchers study SARS-CoV2 infections. It will also become training data for artificial intelligence systems so these kinds of processes can be automated in the future. The AIs that are trained could help not just with Covid-19 research but also other diseases.","It could lead to people becoming more addicted to video games. If people are able to immerse themselves in a game and get rewards for helping with real-world scientific research, they may be more likely to spend more time playing video games. This could lead to people becoming less social and more isolated, which would have a negative impact on their mental health.",https://www.wired.com/story/eve-online-project-discovery-covid-19-citizen-science/,2021-10-23 11:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.995049774646759,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Health & Wellbeing
4,"Quest for prosthetic retinas progresses toward human trials, with a VR assist","An artificial retina would be an enormous boon to the many people with visual impairments, and the possibility is creeping closer to reality year by year. One of the latest advancements takes a different and very promising approach, using tiny dots that convert light to electricity, and virtual reality has helped show that it could be a viable path forward.

These photovoltaic retinal prostheses come from the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, where Diego Ghezzi has been working on the idea for several years now.

Early retinal prosthetics were created decades ago, and the basic idea is as follows: A camera outside the body (on a pair of glasses, for instance) sends a signal over a wire to a tiny microelectrode array, which consists of many tiny electrodes that pierce the nonfunctioning retinal surface and stimulate the working cells directly.

The problems with this are mainly that powering and sending data to the array requires a wire running from outside the eye in — generally speaking a “don’t” when it comes to prosthetics and the body in general. The array itself is also limited in the number of electrodes it can have by the size of each, meaning for many years the effective resolution in the best case scenario was on the order of a few dozen or hundred “pixels.” (The concept doesn’t translate directly because of the way the visual system works.)

Ghezzi’s approach obviates both these problems with the use of photovoltaic materials, which turn light into an electric current. It’s not so different from what happens in a digital camera, except instead of recording the charge as in image, it sends the current into the retina like the powered electrodes did. There’s no need for a wire to relay power or data to the implant, because both are provided by the light shining on it.

In the case of the EPFL prosthesis, there are thousands of tiny photovoltaic dots, which would in theory be illuminated by a device outside the eye sending light in according to what it detects from a camera. Of course, it’s still an incredibly difficult thing to engineer. The other part of the setup would be a pair of glasses or goggles that both capture an image and project it through the eye onto the implant.

We first heard of this approach back in 2018, and things have changed somewhat since then, as a new paper documents.

“We increased the number of pixels from about 2,300 to 10,500,” explained Ghezzi in an email to TechCrunch. “So now it is difficult to see them individually and they look like a continuous film.”

Of course when those dots are pressed right up against the retina it’s a different story. After all, that’s only 100×100 pixels or so if it were a square — not exactly high definition. But the idea isn’t to replicate human vision, which may be an impossible task to begin with, let alone realistic for anyone’s first shot.

“Technically it is possible to make pixel smaller and denser,” Ghezzi explained. “The problem is that the current generated decreases with the pixel area.”

So the more you add, the tougher it is to make it work, and there’s also the risk (which they tested) that two adjacent dots will stimulate the same network in the retina. But too few and the image created may not be intelligible to the user. 10,500 sounds like a lot, and it may be enough — but the simple fact is that there’s no data to support that. To start on that the team turned to what may seem like an unlikely medium: VR.

Because the team can’t exactly do a “test” installation of an experimental retinal implant on people to see if it works, they needed another way to tell whether the dimensions and resolution of the device would be sufficient for certain everyday tasks like recognizing objects and letters.

To do this, they put people in VR environments that were dark except for little simulated “phosphors,” the pinpricks of light they expect to create by stimulating the retina via the implant; Ghezzi likened what people would see to a constellation of bright, shifting stars. They varied the number of phosphors, the area they appear over, and the length of their illumination or “tail” when the image shifted, asking participants how well they could perceive things like a word or scene.

Their primary finding was that the most important factor was visual angle — the overall size of the area where the image appears. Even a clear image is difficult to understand if it only takes up the very center of your vision, so even if overall clarity suffers it’s better to have a wide field of vision. The robust analysis of the visual system in the brain intuits things like edges and motion even from sparse inputs.

This demonstration showed that the implant’s parameters are theoretically sound and the team can start working toward human trials. That’s not something that can happen in a hurry, and while this approach is very promising compared with earlier, wired ones, it will still be several years even in the best case scenario before it’s possible it could be made widely available. Still, the very prospect of a working retinal implant of this type is an exciting one and we’ll be following it closely.","It can be used to create an immersive environment in which people can be tricked or coerced into doing things they wouldn’t normally do. This is because VR can be used to create a highly realistic and lifelike environment in which people can be placed. In this environment, people can be persuaded or coerced into doing things they wouldn’t normally do because they believe that they are in a safe place where nothing can hurt them. This can lead to people being tricked into doing things against their will or being coerced into doing things that they may not want to do.",https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/quest-for-prosthetic-retinas-progresses-towards-human-trials-with-a-vr-assist/,2021-03-18 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9943081736564636,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,TechCrunch,User Experience & Entertainment
5,HTC’s Plan for You to Avoid Smacking Your Head in VR,"This is in addition to an existing safety feature HTC already has on the Vive that shows you a translucent blue grid whenever you move toward the perimeter of your playing space; that can be helpful, but it’s not indicative of what (or who) is really in front of you.

The visual aids are hardly groundbreaking, but they address an important issue that is still very much up in the air for consumer virtual reality. Nobody wants to get hurt playing with virtual reality, and getting a sense of your surroundings might make some people more comfortable with trying it out in the first place. An HTC spokesman told me both are planned for inclusion in the consumer version of the headset. So is the ability to see when something–your dog, for instance–comes into your playing space.

The Vive Pre is meant for developers and will be available to them this month, but when I tried it out today, I thought its size, heft, and suggested that it’s probably pretty similar to the as-yet-unpriced Vive to be released in the coming months.",There is a risk that people will become too immersed in virtual reality and forget about the real world.

7,The Most Important Movie of 2015 Is a VR Cartoon About a Hedgehog,"Right now the goal at Oculus Story Studio is move the Post-its.

The true finish line is locking their latest animated virtual reality movie Henry, but to do that they have quite a few issues to fix. There's a conference room wall in their San Francisco office covered in dozens of sticky paper squares of all shades, each representing a problem someone has to fix before the project is done. It’s like something out of a scene from Silicon Valley, only instead of tweaking a compression algorithm it's optimizing what is essentially a cartoon.

Then again, most cartoons aren’t made using videogame engines. And right now, that reliance on game-making software—specifically Unreal Engine 4—is creating a lot of new Post-its.

Christie Hemm Klok/WIRED

It's two weeks before Henry's July 28 premiere, and the creative brain-trust of Story Studio is huddled in a dimly lit room (they do meditation in here in the mornings). Ramiro Lopez Dau, the director, is wearing the latest prototype of Oculus' headset and watching the current version of Henry—something he's seen dozens of times. His supervising technical director, Max Planck, is at a computer console, his shoes off; he's watching the feeds going into both of Lopez Dau's eyes, while the handful of other employees in the room watch Planck's display and point out glitches. A ladybug shows up in the wrong color? That’s a Post-it. One of Henry's eyes looks wonky? That’s another.

""These will all become Post-it notes,"" Story Studio's creative director Saschka Unseld says to me in a hushed voice so as not disrupt his team's flow. ""Ryan [Thomas], our main production coordinator, is constantly typing.""

Indeed, Thomas will spend most of the next hour looking up from his laptop only to gather enough info for the next note. What the Story Studio team is doing, if it had a filmmaking analog, would be looking at dailies—except only one person can watch it at a time. Also, ""dailies"" is a bit of a misnomer. They used to do this once every couple of weeks, then weekly—there was too much to fix in between, and it took hours to render—but now, two weeks out, they do it every afternoon. Fix a problem, lose a Post-it. Watch it again, gain two more. ""It makes me weirdly paranoid that things suddenly break, because I don’t know how much stuff will be broken tomorrow,"" Unseld says ruefully. ""Sometimes it’s rough to get a sense of these things are done, we move on to fix these things.""

But breaking things and fixing them is the whole point of Story Studio. Last fall, a few months after Facebook acquired Oculus, the studio was founded with the mission to determine what was possible for VR filmmaking, and then to share that knowledge with the world. ""Part of the mission is 'inspire and educate,'"" producer Edward Saatchi says. And a huge hurdle to doing that has been figuring out how to make movies using both traditional animation software like Maya and videogame tools, while also making Hollywood filmmakers comfortable with the media as ""an art-form, rather than cinema in a videogame,"" as Saatchi puts it.

They’ve done it—Story Studio had its coming-out party at Sundance in January, showcasing an exploratory short called Lost—but they had to break Unreal in the process. ""A couple of months ago we switched,"" Unseld says, gesturing toward the small team of animators working on Henry. “We disconnected ourselves from the out-of-the-box Unreal Engine and opened up the code so we can just play with the innards of it.”

Christie Hemm Klok/WIRED

Epic Games, the developer behind the Unreal Engine, has always kept the code for the software open-source; The company encourages people to play with it, but as Epic’s founder Tim Sweeney notes, Story Studio is ""pushing the engine really hard."" To get what they want out of Unreal 4, visual effects supervisor Inigo Quilez has written code to make things like fur and shadows behave more easily and naturally. It's a concern game developers rarely worried about outside of non-playable ""cinematic sequences""—most players race by shadows before they really register.

Unreal 4 does feature an animation tool that helps developers build cinematic experiences, and by the end of the year they hope to incorporate something called Sequencer that will feel more familiar to filmmakers used to working in ProTools. But what Story Studio is doing is still beyond that—and Epic is happy to have them guide the way. ""I think the thing people are going to be really impressed with when they watch Henry, and I've only seen little bits and pieces, but it really does look like a classic animated movie,"" says Epic CTO Kim Libreri, who made his bones doing VFX for The Matrix movies before moving on to Lucasfilm and eventually into gaming. ""They’re doing a lot of tricks to produce that look, but it shows that with perseverance and the right mindset to scale your techniques to work for your art, you can get a pretty good result.""

A New Way to Care

It wasn’t just that Story Studio needed Unreal to do something it wasn’t made for. They also wanted to do things that had never been done in movies, period: they want Henry to look you in the eye, no matter where you are in his virtual world.

At its core, Henry is a simple story. The titular hero is hedgehog who loves hugs. (This, clearly, is problematic.) While celebrating his birthday by himself, his balloon animals come to life and try to befriend him. (This, clearly, is really problematic.) There are emotional ups and downs, and when Henry experiences a certain feeling, he looks at the viewer to share his sadness or excitement.

This is an incredibly rare thing. It’s also unnerving; the first time I tried an early demo, I immediately felt like a voyeur, as if I was spying on this poor hedgehog during his sad solo birthday. But in VR, the whole point is that you’re meant to feel as though you’re physically there with Henry—and as Unseld pointed out to me when I took off the goggles, it’s weird if Henry doesn’t recognize someone sitting on his living room floor. ""It's just like 'Why don't you look at me? I'm right here!'"" Unseld laughs. But when he does it carries an emotional connection, an empathy, that even those abused action figures in Toy Story 3 didn’t quite muster. (Unseld will later lament that this connection makes comedy twice as hard because Buster Keaton-esque physical comedy just feels ""mean."")","It can make people feel like voyeurs. When people put on a VR headset and enter into a virtual world, they are immersed in that world and can feel like they are actually there. This can be a problem if the virtual world contains something that is meant to be private, like a person's home. If someone is in VR and sees someone else in their home, they may feel like they are spying on that person and violating their privacy.",https://www.wired.com/2015/07/oculus-story-studio-making-henry/,2015-07-28 19:45:13+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9949761629104614,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Security & Privacy
8,You can now practice firing someone in virtual reality,"Meet Barry: his sole purpose in life is to listen patiently, and then protest or sob a little as you fire him from an imaginary job in virtual reality.

Disposable hero: He was created by Talespin, a company that offers virtual reality workplace training. Barry and other VR characters were developed to help teach people “soft” management skills—such as how to let someone go without causing a scene. If you are too blunt with Barry, he’ll put his head in his hands; other missteps will cause him to shout and yell.

Learning tool: This might seem bizarre, even dystopian, but virtual reality is gaining momentum as a training tool. The technology can provide a heightened sense of realism that aids the learning process, and it can allow people to practice doing things that would be impossible otherwise. VR is used to teach people to perform safety tasks, for example. But it is also increasingly being used to train new employees at places like Walmart and Chipotle.

Office space: You can expect this trend to spread to offices in coming years. “We are seeing repeated interest in building training products around interviewing skills, navigating difficult conversations, consultative selling, performance reviews, and identifying diversity and inclusion best practices, to name a few,” says Kyle Jackson, CEO of Talespin.

Unreal feeling: Computers and algorithms are sometimes now used to monitor workers’ output and performance. But while it’s common to think that social and emotional skills are exempt from this automation creep, Barry suggests otherwise. “Soft skills are ranked among the most important for any organization as they discuss their needs for the future of work,” Jackson says. “We don't see this slowing down any time soon.”

Uncanny colleague: The catch with Barry and other virtual characters, in case you didn’t guess, is that their effectiveness depends on how convincing they are. Barry looks quite realistic for an avatar, but Jackson says the character follows a set script—so it can’t interact in a very natural way.

Learning process: Avatars behave more naturally if they’re powered by machine learning—but it’s going to be a long while before these characters exhibit, or respond to, body language in realistic ways. As Danielle Levac, a professor at Northeastern University who specializes in using VR for rehab, says: “If you’re not able to escape the notion that it isn’t a real person, it’s not necessarily going to transfer.”","It may not be effective in teaching people social and emotional skills. This is because the characters in VR are not able to interact in a very natural way and may follow a set script.

I can’t quite make it out, but I also get the distinct sense that this RV isn’t going anywhere, so I get out through the driver’s side door, launch myself into the air 30 or so feet, and soar up to the destination: The Gate.

For the untold thousands of Burning Man attendees who have flocked to Nevada’s Black Rock Desert over the past 30-plus Augusts and Septembers, The Gate might just be the only experience every one of them has had. The playa of “Black Rock City” is vast, and the programming varied, but everyone passes through the same single entry point.

This year, The Gate is different. This year, it’s virtual. (In case the whole flying thing didn’t tip you off.) With Covid-19 dousing the flame of the real-world Burning Man, a group of eight digital experiences has emerged to carry the torch. Much like the drive-ins that have emerged to stand in for closed movie theaters, and the Zoom gatherings that have replaced drag nights at bars and improv comedy sets, the annual festival is using ingenuity to help people hit the playa while staying socially distant. And BRCvr, the way I got there, isn't just a cobbled together an approximation of Black Rock City—it’s a perfect reconstruction. Comprising more than 100 interconnected worlds of art and activity, BRCvr wants to unite seasoned Burners and VR-loving first-timers in a weeklong celebration of radical togetherness that delivers everything but the sunburn and dehydration.

Before Greg Edwards had even been to Burning Man, he knew what he wanted to do there. This was 2014; the year before, he’d begun building a 360-degree Coachella experience, and he’d fallen in love with the potential of bringing massive festival experiences into virtual space. Burning Man, he realized, would be perfect for the then-revolutionary Google Cardboard. So that August, he showed up on the playa with a DSLR camera and took photos of every square inch of the place. “I just dove in,” he says. “I have a bad habit of coming up with an idea, and then doing whatever it takes to make it happen—even if the technology is five years too early for it to work.”","It may lead to people becoming more isolated from one another.

10,Boss Acting Nicer Recently? You May Have VR to Thank,"Barry's hair has long gone gray, his face lined with deep signs of age. Sitting across from me in his pressed blue shirt, he looks like an uncle, maybe even a grandfather. But Barry's employment file is … not a fun read. He told a coworker she was a ""whiner,"" and his colleagues have filed complaints about his inappropriate remarks six times this year. So as avuncular as he seems, I don't really have any options. I have to fire the guy.

""We've addressed the disruptions you've caused with coworkers before,"" I say, ""and this last one is strike three.""

He immediately becomes flustered, defensive. ""Everyone is so—oh, come on,"" he says, stammering a little. ""Everyone is so sensitive. It wasn't like this 10 years ago.""

A screen appears floating above and to the side of his head, containing three possible things I could say. In each choice, a word or two is bolded, so that the VR software I'm using can identify what I'm saying and trigger Barry's response accordingly. The second sounds wishy-washy (""You know I've always liked you, but I have to follow the rules. I'm really sorry.""), the third sounds bloodless (""As discussed, your actions are disruptive to coworkers. This is the final offense. We are letting you go.""), so I opt for the first. ""Times are different now,"" I say, wincing a little inwardly at how I sound. ""We're going to have to let you go.""

Barry twists in his chair, motioning at the other desks and people outside the door of my office. ""I have 20 more years' experience than anyone in there!"" he says. ""Have you looked at my sales numbers? How do you justify this based on those numbers?"" There's nothing I can say that won't make things worse, so I choose neutral compassion: ""I understand if you need a moment to process this.""

His face crumples. He looks down at his hands, then back at me. Is he going to yell? I think. Cry? How do I deal with that? ""Y-y-y-ou...Do you…"" His voice breaks. He looks around, composes himself.

""Take this time to process this,"" I say again. ""I'll go over the next steps when you're ready.""

Yet, after a few more seconds, Barry seems to turn the corner into acceptance. ""Well, I didn't see this coming,"" he says. ""I really thought I was going to finish my career here. Look, I appreciate the opportunity. It was a pleasure working with you.""

Whew.

""Nice work,"" Kyle Jackson says as I take my headset off. It doesn't always go so smoothly: The first time Jackson demonstrated the process for a roomful of Oculus executives, Barry wound up yelling and cursing at the person in the headset. ""But everybody thought it was funny because it was the colleague that kinda needed that feedback,"" he says, ""so it was a really honest moment for the room."" (And for anyone hearing the anecdote, presumably.)

Awkward moments aside, VR's role in the corporate world has far outpaced its consumer impact. But while its applications have largely been clustered around design, collaboration, and even job training simulations, virtual reality has in the past year seen a flurry of activity around so-called soft skills: leadership, communications, HR applications, and other people-focused business fields. Now, Talespin, a company Jackson cofounded, hopes that virtual humans like Barry will allow companies to leverage VR's unique social mojo to make their employees smarter—faster.",The main unintended consequence of virtual reality discussed in the article is that it may make people more comfortable with interacting with computers than with other people.

11,Facebook Needs to Stop Bad VR Apps Before They Start,"Facebook really, really wants you to give VR a go—no pun intended. That's the message the company communicated yesterday during day one of F8, its annual developers conference in San Jose, California. The F8 keynote was filled with assurances that VR headsets like the new Oculus Go won't create a barrier between you and the people around you. Instead, the company believes that wearing a face computer will be even more social, because you'll be playing games, taking meetings, and video chatting with friends and family.

And since the apps that have already been created for Samsung's Oculus-based Gear headset can be ported over to the Oculus Go headset, there are already more than a thousand apps available for the new $200 Oculus Go. What else do you need at this point in order to embrace VR?

For one, maybe a little reassurance that VR apps—as well as AR apps—are being designed with user privacy and reasonable data-sharing practices in mind. Facebook still needs to prove that it's thinking about new technologies in a way that ensures they won't become the next obvious frontier for abuse, misinformation, or even election interference. As the company's primary platform has swelled to more than two billion users, it's had its share of issues with false news, hate speech, and bad apps, due in part to Facebook's own lack of due diligence during growth phases.

Facebook's Oculus VR user base is still minuscule by comparison—according to one research firm, 1.8 million Oculus Go devices are expected to sell this year—but if Go becomes the great VR democratizer that Facebook is hoping it will be, then the new headset is introducing a new kind of app and a new kind of app store to a whole new subset of Facebook users. It also raises the question of how Facebook will deal with ""fakeness"" in an environment that is, by definition, entirely virtual.

Facebook's executives in VR and AR say they have learned some lessons from the early days of Facebook, and that the company is trying to ""ensure a very high quality of platform against misinformation or against bad actors,"" according to AR/VR executive Andrew Bosworth. But Bosworth, known as ""Boz,"" also said in an interview with WIRED that he believes Facebook's AR and VR app platforms are still too nascent to have serious abuse problems.

Facebook-owned Oculus utilizes its own app platform, separate from Facebook, Messenger, or the other apps that Facebook owns. You don't need a Facebook account to sign up for Oculus, and linking your Oculus account to your Facebook account is optional, as WIRED's Peter Rubin points out in his review of the headset. Go has its own app store, and many of the mobile VR apps that are front and center right now are highly recognizable brands or titles: Netflix, Hulu, NatGeo, Minecraft, The Last Jedi.

There are also only around a thousand apps right now, which means each app is reviewed manually, according to Bosworth. ""It's a manageable number of applications,"" he says, ""and you can just look at every one of them and make sure there's nothing in there that's untoward.""

Reality Check

In a pre-emptive move, ahead of changes that could be enforced when Europe's General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect, Oculus published an update to its privacy policies two weeks ago. The update highlighted the addition of a privacy control center for users and clarified the kinds of information Oculus, and in some cases Facebook, collects about Oculus users. It also divulged the kinds of data that Oculus app-makers have access to: the real-time position of your headset and controllers, your Friend List, and the boundaries of the physical space where you're using Oculus. ""We periodically audit our systems to determine if there's evidence of nefarious activity,"" the post reads, ""and we take action accordingly.""

In other words: it doesn't read all that different from Facebook's privacy policies and settings on its core app or other apps. Especially when you consider the periodic audits; Facebook's own privacy audit in 2017 didn't catch the Cambridge Analytica data caper. As VR gets more sophisticated, and as standalone VR headsets get better at profile-building and advanced positional tracking (like the kind promised with Oculus's ""Santa Cruz"" headset), it's enough to make any non-early-adopter wary about the volume and granularity of data that's being collected.","The potential for abuse and misuse of user data. Facebook has a history of problems with bad actors and misinformation, and VR could be the next frontier for these issues.

12,This Augmented-Reality Sandbox Turns Dirt Into a UI,"We've seen how kids take to touchscreens. To them, our unfathomably sophisticated smartphones and tablets are about as hard to figure out as a bucket full of blocks. It's a little bit eerie, watching a youngster prod his or her way around an iPad; it makes you wonder if future generations will ever have a chance to foster any of the skepticism we feel towards cyborg enhancements and brain implants and other unsavory flavors of invasive, singularity-style computing. Hopefully they'll grow into it.

But while all their deft, chocolate-fingered swiping might make a future of baby's first tablet seem inevitable, a project out of UC Davis offers a glimpse of an entirely different type of high-tech educational engagement--one that doesn't involve youngsters pressing their faces up against screens for hours on end. It's a sandbox that lets kids mold its contents into miniature mountains, lakes and rivers--and then, with a little high-tech magic, brings that terrain to life before their eyes.

>It's a sandbox that lets kids mold its contents, then brings that terrain to life.

The project offers an irresistible combination: the timeless tactile joy of sand in hand plus a dollop of whiz-bang tech to top it off. A Kinect camera mounted above the sandbox tracks the physical activity below. As visitors young and old go about their terraforming, a projector throws a dynamic topographic map on top of it all, updating contour lines and elevation colors in real time. Then, the fun part: a virtual rainstorm, also supplied by the projector, sends a torrent of blue water cascading down the peaks, showing runoff and watershed on the landscape created moments before.

Inspired by a YouTube video from a group of Czech researchers, researchers at UC Davis' W. M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES) started work on their augmented-reality sandbox in early 2012, as part of an National Science Foundation-funded program focused on water system education. Last summer, the video below, showing off their prototype, garnered over a million views on YouTube. Now, a pair of museums on either coast of the country are home to augmented sandboxes of their own--one at ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center in Vermont; one at the Tahoe Environmental Research Center at UC Davis--with a third being installed at the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley this month.

The exhibits are presented with minimal instruction. Play, curiosity, and self-driven learning are all encouraged. ""The power of the sandbox is that it's trivial to make your own terrain completely from scratch and in moments, without any training,"" explains Oliver Kreylos, one of the lead UC Davis researchers on the project. ""There's just no better way to teach how topographic contour lines work, or how water flows over a landscape, than building whatever terrain you can imagine, and then seeing the contours and the water react in real time to any changes you make.""

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

At ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center in Vermont, some 43,000 visitors have played with the interactive installation since it was installed in May. ""We have watched our guests at every age dig in and explore with their hands, ask lots of questions, test ideas, challenge their friends and family, wonder about how it works, and express curiosity and joy,"" says Julie Silverman, the museum's Director of New.

She says the exhibit often fosters collaborations between strangers, prompting groups to build mega-mountains with all the sand or to see if they can flood the entire landscape to create an island chain. And according to Silverman, it's the rare exhibit with replay value; people actually come back later in their visit for more time playing in the sand.

ECHO's sandbox is one of three official versions of the sandbox in the wild, but Kreylos, the UC Davis researcher, says he knows of at least six others around the world, all built using the software and schematics his team has made available on their site. One of these was built by a high school robotics team in Ithaca, New York, another by a science center in Sao Paolo. There's one in an elementary school in Australia and another, Kreylos says, somewhere in Mongolia.

>Touchscreens are better than mouses, but surely dynamic environments are better yet.

The point is that far from a complex, custom-built device, KeckCAVES' design is relatively simple for others to put together themselves. It doesn't take much more than a Kinect, a projector, a spare computer, and some of their code. ""It appears the installation is quite straightforward,"" Kreylos says, ""and I'm guessing there are a good number out there I don't know about. I'm currently helping two groups doing final calibration for theirs, and another group is out buying equipment right now.""

The applications for the AR sandbox, Kreylos admits, are fairly limited. Sand can't teach you much about math, or history. Indeed, much of Kreylos' work involves developing immersive, intuitive virtual interfaces--next-gen tools that could prove useful for all sorts of disciplines. You can watch him demo one of his latest projects involving an Oculus Rift headset and two Razer Hydra joysticks here.","The potential for addiction.

13,Oculus Rift Takes You Inside the Wild Mind of Salvador Dalí,"When you first parachute into the virtual reality landscape of Dreams of Dalí, you find yourself in a vast desert, staring up at two impossibly tall statues---an amorphous man and woman, heads bowed in prayer. The two figures are the central subjects of Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet’s “Angelus,” which Salvador Dalí began painting around 1933 and are based on Jean-François Millet’s French realist painting, The Angelus, from 1859.

Goodby Silverstein & Partners, the creative agency behind this virtual reality experience for an exhibit at The Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, chose this painting carefully: In the foreground of Dali's original painting is a tiny silhouette of a man and a child. The child is Dalí. The man is his father. In Dreams of Dalí,* *you become a viewer and a visitor, a third inhabitant of the surreal dreamscape.

“We want to be that ant, that’s staring at these towers,” says Sam Luchini, a creative director at GS&P. “The lonely feeling, of you being in the middle of the desert and finding those gigantic towers” is the sensation the creators wanted to summon with Dreams of Dalí, which works with Oculus Rift and is part of the Disney and Dalí: Architects of the Imagination exhibit through June 12.

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

It would be wrong to say Dreams of Dalí takes you inside a Dalí painting, even though the setting for the experience is an exquisitely rendered version of Archeological Reminiscence. Rather, the painting is a jumping off point, a metaphorical springboard into a digital walkabout that its creators hope feels like traipsing around Dalí’s imagination.

To produce this effect, Luchini's team had to translate Dali's painting into an immersive dreamscape. Lead developer Nathan Shipley used the same 3D modeling, lighting, and texturing tools game developers use, and built a gaze-based navigation system---similar to what you’d find in most VR experiences out there---that encourages users to wander freely. The creators had to take some artistic liberties with Archeological Reminiscence by imagining what the towering statues might look like from behind, and what might exist beyond them. In the original painting, the Angelus figures are envisioned as crumbling ruins. Castle-like structures stand around the figures' feet, and a thin crescent moon hangs in the sky. In Dreams of Dalí, however, you can glide through the ruins. Behind them, you’ll find four gigantic elephants, elevated skyward on beanstalk legs. These are from Dalí’s The Elephants, and appear other paintings, as well. There’s a small girl skipping rope; she’s adapted from Landscape With a Girl Skipping Rope, Dalí’s painting from 1936.

A consistency of themes, settings, and subjects make Dalí’s oeuvre especially well-suited to a virtual reality treatment. Many of his paintings seem to be set in the same ominous, glowing desert. Characters vanish and reappear from painting to painting, hinting at the existence of an unobserved world and unseen activity; while their sinewy, impossible forms---Dalí’s trademark as a surrealist artist---seem to indicate their affiliation with one fictive species. Through his art, Dalí created imaginary worlds; through the power of VR, Goodby Silverstein & Parnters lets us experience that world like never before.","The potential for users to get lost in the dreamlike world that has been created. While the designers of Dreams of Dalí have taken care to create a navigation system that encourages users to wander freely, it is still possible for users to become so engrossed in the experience that they lose track of time and place.

14,US Army soldiers will soon wear Microsoft’s HoloLens AR goggles in combat,"Microsoft has won a $480 million deal to supply more than 100,000 augmented-reality HoloLens headsets to the US Army, Bloomberg reports.

Uses? The Army plans to use the headsets for combat missions as well as training. The technology will be adapted to incorporate night vision and thermal sensing, offer hearing protection, monitor for concussion, and measure vital signs like breathing and “readiness.” AR firm MagicLeap also bid for the contract, according to Bloomberg.

A first: HoloLens is used for training by the US and Israeli military already, but this would be the first time it’s been used for live combat. It’s another example of how AR is being adopted far more enthusiastically by organizations than consumers.

Tensions: The deal is more good news for Microsoft, which overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company yesterday. However, there could be pushback against this contract—and it’s as likely to come from Microsoft employees themselves as from external groups. The relationship between the technology sector and the US military has become fraught over the past year, with employees at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft protesting their companies’ bids for government contracts. The solution? Move uneasy staff members to other projects, Microsoft president Brad Smith said last month.","One potential consequence of the widespread adoption of virtual reality technology is that it could lead to a further disconnection from the physical world.

15,A Brave Bomb-Disposal Robot You Control in Virtual Reality,"A robot probably isn’t coming for your job. But there are plenty of dull, dirty, and dangerous gigs out there that humanity wouldn’t mind turning over to the machines. Indeed, a robot called Taurus from SRI International has already begun its takeover of one of the most dangerous jobs on Earth: bomb disposal.

Sure, bomb disposal robots have been rolling the earth for some time. But now SRI has taken its already brilliant bot and made it ... brillianter, by outfitting Taurus with virtual reality. Before, Taurus’ operators watched a 3-D monitor to see the world through the robot’s eyes, then manipulated controls that translated their movements into the movement of the robot’s hands and graspers. Now by strapping on a VR headset, the user can use Oculus Touch controllers as manipulators.

It’s about as close as you can get to assuming the body of a machine. And adding to the immersion is the haptic feedback SRI can also load into the robot. “If you need to actually feel either the static forces that it's pushing on, on a wall or the world, we can do that,” says Mark Baybutt, associate R&D director in the SRI Robotics Group. Especially useful for feeling around a suspicious device without blowing up your robotic proxy.

Now, look through the headset and you won’t just see the world through Taurus’ eyes. You’ll see a heads-up display of sorts, with virtual buttons you can tap with the Oculus Touch motion controls to lock the robot’s arms, for instance. “Not only does it make you feel more immersed and connected with the remote world that you're operating,” says Baybutt, “but it also offers very unique and interesting human machine interfaces that we can actually create with different buttons or information presented to the user.”

Get ready for more of this sort of thing. As ever more sophisticated robots creep into our lives, we’ll need ever more sophisticated ways of interfacing with them. You’re already used to an operating system on your phone or PC, sure, but humans will have to develop interfaces for the virtual world that will connect us to machines like Taurus.

Not that you personally will be disposing of bombs anytime soon. And not that Taurus is only good for disposing bombs—send it into a mine if you don’t want to go yourself. If it’s dangerous and it needs doing, chances are that in the near future a robot will be putting its life on the line for a human with a machine strapped to their face.","It could lead to humans becoming more detached from the real world.

16,Pollen Robotics’ humanoid robot can be controlled remotely with VR,"Pollen Robotics turned heads at last year’s CES. After all, a humanoid robot will do that on the show floor (even if it’s only half of one). The French startup is back for this year’s show (insofar as anyone is really back for the show), with some key updates to its robot, Reachy.

The biggest news this time out is the addition of teleoperation functionality using a virtual reality setup. Using a VR headset, a remote operator is capable of viewing video through the robot’s two face cameras. VR controllers are used to manipulate the robot’s arms for pick and place operations. The functionality can be used for, among other things, training the robot to perform tasks.

Reachy is notable for being an open-source robotics platform. The $17,000 bot is potentially suitable for robotics research, including prototyping one’s own technology. As evidenced by last year’s event, it’s also a fun presentation robot, fulfilling a similar function as, say, Softbank’s Pepper. It’s not, however, going to be taking over any manufacturing jobs any time soon.

The robot’s software is built on the popular open-source robotics operating system, ROS 2. The on-board computer and cameras have both been upgraded since the company first showed off the robot roughly this time last year.","A potential issue with wider adoption of VR in society is the potential for people to become isolated from the physical world.

17,The 6 Most Important Things That Happened in Virtual Reality in 2015,"2. Oculus unveils its first consumer headset, Rift, and Oculus Touch hand controllers

In June, Facebook-owned Oculus trotted out its first consumer headset, Rift, and a pair of half-moon, button-bedecked controllers, both of which it plans to release next year (see “Oculus Shows Its First Consumer Headset, Circular Hand Controls”).

The matte black headset has two OLED displays, a wide field of view, and a speaker over each ear; it will need to physically connect to a powerful computer, along with a separate sensor that tracks the user’s motions. The controls, meanwhile, enable hand gestures like dragging objects, pointing, and waving.

The company hasn’t publicly stated a specific release date for the headset, though it has said it will come in the first quarter of 2016. The hand controls are slated for release in the second quarter.

3. Microsoft shows off speedy progress with HoloLens, its holographic headset

Microsoft’s HoloLens, which is more correctly referred to as augmented reality than virtual reality since it is intended to blend 3-D virtual visuals with the real world, debuted in January. At the time, Microsoft invited a number of reporters to try out HoloLens, which it hopes could eventually be used to do things like play games and work on 3-D models. While Microsoft presented it as a sort of futuristic set of ski goggles, reporters were only able to test a much clunkier version that was still tethered to a stationary computer, and required a so-called holographic processing unit worn around the neck.

But at the company’s Build developer conference in May, Microsoft let reporters try out a fully self-contained prototype version of the device that looked much more polished (see “Microsoft Making Fast Progress with HoloLens”). This prototype gave a much better sense of the hard work required to fit a lot of technology into a compact, good-looking, untethered head-mounted display. It’s not clear when HoloLens will be released to the public; Microsoft has only said that a $3,000 developer edition will begin shipping early next year.

4. Cameras envision new ways to film virtual reality

At Google’s I/O developer conference in June, the company announced a new kind of camera for taking live-action 3-D virtual-reality videos. Called Jump, it includes 16 cameras in a circular array, making it possible to capture each point from three perspectives; software can then convert the footage into 3-D. Google released the Jump design for free, and GoPro started selling a fully assembled version of the device late this year.

Also this year, photography startup Lytro—which has struggled to popularize its camera for consumers that lets you refocus images after taking them—said in November that it’s working on a spherical camera for capturing live-action 3-D films for virtual reality, too (see “Lytro Is Building a Camera to Capture Live-Action Virtual Reality”).

5. Google Cardboard goes out to New York Times Sunday print subscribers

In November, the New York Times sent over a million Google Cardboard virtual-reality kits to its subscribers to promote its virtual-reality documentary “The Displaced,” which details what happens to children displaced by war. Though Google Cardboard—a foldable, handheld virtual-reality headset with plastic lenses that users must slip a smartphone into to power it—was introduced back in 2014, this move brought a simple, immersive experience into many more homes (see “Google Aims to Make VR Hardware Irrelevant Before it Even Gets Going”).

6. Samsung starts selling its new Gear VR

Also in November, Samsung released the latest version of its Gear VR headset, a $100 headset developed with Oculus that uses a Samsung smartphone as its computer and display. The newest Gear VR costs half as much as its predecessor did when it came out in 2014, and supports more of Samsung’s smartphones (the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy S6 Edge+). It still lacks important functions like positional tracking, which means games and other VR experiences can’t track your head movements, but it shows Samsung and Oculus are serious about marrying virtual reality and mobile devices.","One of the main unintended consequences of virtual reality being discussed in the article is the potential for addiction.

Here is the starting demo. Move your head so you can see at least one eye in the mirror. If you are at a normal viewing position, you will probably see your eyes appearing a little bit bigger than they are in real life. This is a virtual image. Now slowly move away from the mirror, but try to keep your eye in view. At some point, the image will become blurry, and then it will come into focus again—but upside down. This is a real image. This is what you should see:

OK, that's cool. But what is the difference between a real and virtual image? Let me start with the most basic virtual image that you have seen—a reflection in a plain old flat mirror. Imagine an object in front of this mirror. I can show how the light interacts with both the mirror and your eye using a light-ray diagram.

Here the green arrow just represents some random object. It could be anything. Now, light hits this object and reflects off in all directions. I have drawn two arrows to represent just some of the reflected light rays. Both of these light rays travel towards the mirror and glance off of it—in such a way that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.

Got it? The light in the room bounces off the object, then bounces off the mirror toward your eye. Notice that after the two rays reflect off the mirror, they never cross. You can draw as many light rays as you like, but they aren't going to cross after reflecting from the mirror.

Now, our human eyes are sort of dumb. They can't really tell where the light came from. Instead, our eyes and brain trace the light back to where it appears to come from. This is where the two dashed lines come in. These are projections of the light rays to a point behind the mirror where the lines converge.",It may lead to people becoming less social. This is because people may become so used to interacting with others through a virtual reality headset that they may no longer feel the need to interact with people in the real world. This could lead to people becoming less social and more isolated from the world around them.,https://www.wired.com/story/the-physics-of-how-a-mirror-creates-a-virtual-world/,2018-05-22 13:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9958102703094482,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
19,I Still Can't Believe How This VR Game Tricked My Brain,"Virtual reality tricks your brains in weird, wonderful ways. If you've done a good VR demo or two, you've likely experienced that sense of presence, of feeling like you really do exist in this made-up world: reacting to virtual people as if they're real people, or trying to balance yourself on a virtual table and falling on your face IRL. I don't think presence is the end of VR's bag of tricks, though. Judging from one VR demo I tried recently, it's just the beginning.

Ripcoil, from developer Sanzaru Games, will ship this year alongside the launch of the Oculus Touch motion controllers. As game designs go, it's fairly simple. Actually, it's pretty close to VR Pong, starring you as the paddle. Two giant robots, one of whom is you, face each other in a brightly-lit future-sports arena, tossing a flying disc back and forth. If the disc goes behind you into your goal, the opponent gets a point. You can catch it and throw it back, rebounding it off the walls if you like, or you can charge up your fist and punch it back at high speed. To defend your own goal, you can move back and forth.

The strangest part is, you never actually move.

You play the game in a standing position, feet planted and knees bent. If you shift your torso to the left or right, you move laterally in that direction in front of your goal. You need only gently nudge your body to start moving slowly, and it doesn't take much movement to zip quickly back and forth.

There's a lot of smart design that goes into* Ripcoil* making you feel as if you embody the giant robot you're portraying. Your arms and body are fully rendered, and move realistically as you shift yourself around. The fast action and responsive controls of the game quickly let you lose yourself in its fiction, and you'll be zipping back and forth catching and tossing flying discs with ease.

Oculus

Playing a game like Ripcoil is a good reminder that motion-control devices like the Wii and Kinect weren't the flash-in-the-pan gimmicks detractors like to portray them as. Instead, they were baby steps along the road to VR. Used in isolation, they don't have much of a lifespan (as evidenced by the fact that Nintendo and Microsoft have abandoned them as standalone devices)—but coupled with VR display, Wii-like motion controls and Kinect-like body tracking are perfect, seamless input methods.","It can trick your brain into thinking that you are actually in the virtual world. This can lead to people reacting to virtual people as if they are real people, which can be dangerous.

20,"Finally, a Useful Application for VR: Training Employees","“Our product vision is about creating the flight simulator for blank: insert job here,” says Derek Belch, Strivr’s founder and CEO.

Virtual reality is not yet widely used by anyone: the best hardware is too clunky and expensive for most of us to want to use more than occasionally, and there isn’t a ton of stuff to do with it, either. Some companies are starting to experiment with it, but it is not yet clear how it might help the bottom line. For now, the technology is more popular with consumers, though that’s still a tiny market.

It makes sense that sports are a big part of Strivr’s customer base. As a graduate student and football coach at Stanford in 2014, Belch started Strivr to help train players, who can only be on the field for a certain amount of time. He figured that watching filmed plays on a VR headset could be a more immersive (and realistic) way to train than just watching videos, shot from the angles viewers typically see, on a flat screen.

So Belch began experimenting, filming football practices once a week with a 360° rig of GoPro cameras set up to show blitzes from the quarterback’s point of view. The results, he said, were really good. So good, in fact, that as he finished his master’s program at Stanford, he decided to turn his project into a company. Stanford’s head football coach, David Shaw, invested in it and is now listed as an advisor to the startup.

These days Strivr, which sits midway between Facebook’s headquarters and Belch’s alma mater on a busy corner in Menlo Park, has branched out far beyond football. In addition to Walmart and various NFL and other sports teams, it’s working with United Rentals, two car makers, and numerous other customers. Stanford still uses it, too, Belch says, filming about 80 plays per week.","It may lead to a decrease in the quality of human interaction.

21,The Inside Story of Google's Bizarre Plunge Into VR,"David Coz worked in Google's Paris office, but what he really wanted was a job at the mothership in Silicon Valley.

Last spring, the French-born Coz turned up at Google headquarters in Mountain View hoping to chat about his latest project with anyone who would listen. ""I came with my prototype and my luggage,"" he says, ""and I met with 10 or 15 people."" One of them was Christian Plagemann, a Google research scientist exploring new interfaces for consumer electronics devices. Though they'd never met, Coz showed him the prototype: a pair of virtual reality goggles made out of cardboard.

Plagemann was intrigued---""David showed me this cardboard box,"" he says, ""and I thought it was absolutely amazing""---and he took the contraption to Google's bigwigs, including CEO Larry Page and vice president of engineering Sundar Pichai. ""I convinced him to leave me one of the boxes. He flew back to Paris. And I started showing it around,"" Plagemann remembers.

Two months later, Pichai unveiled the project on the keynote stage at Google's annual developer conference in San Francisco, and Google employees handed cardboard headsets to thousands of coders as they streamed from the speakers' hall. It was a slightly odd sideshow at a conference where the company typically doled out millions of dollars in phones, tablets, and other electronic gear. But in the year since, this unexpectedly low-tech device---something that wraps around an ordinary smartphone screen---has engendered a sweeping virtual reality project inside the company, giving Google a foothold in an area poised to reshape the tech world.

Coz did join the mothership. He and Plagemann and the other Paris employee who created Google Cardboard, Damian Henry, are all part of a Google VR team that's ""bigger than people think it is."" In December, the team roped in a group of 3-D vision experts led by Steve Seitz, a University of Washington professor whose work gave rise to a panoramic photo application from Microsoft called Photosynth. John Wiley, who previously oversaw the visual design of the Google search engine, recently joined as well. And the team is now fashioning rather complex VR tech that puts Google in competition with Facebook, Microsoft, and others.

On Thursday, after team leader Clay Bavor showed off a new incarnation of the cardboard goggles at this year's Google I/O developer conference, he revealed that the company has designed a 16-lens camera that can record videos across 360 degrees, and that it's developing a software system that can turn these videos into the kind of immersive, stereoscopic experiences the goggles are intended to provide. The company calls all this its ""Jump"" VR platform, and it says GoPro will offer a version of its camera this summer. But all these developments, it seems, are merely precursors to something larger. ""We have ambitions beyond just Cardboard,"" Bavor says. ""There are many other things going on.""

'The VR Nerd'

The rise of Google Cardboard shows the unusual way Google operates. In Paris, Coz and Henry worked for the Google Cultural Institute, a way for museums and other institutions to put their art online. Their cardboard goggles, meanwhile, were a ""20 percent project,"" where Google employees dedicate one day a week (that is, 20 percent of their time) to some new idea.

The project began after they stumbled onto a little-seen YouTube video shot from a flying drone. It was a stereoscopic video meant for a 3-D headset they didn't have, and at some point, they realized they could view such videos if they wrapped a makeshift headset around a phone---""you just have to make sure the phone understands where your head is looking,"" Coz says---and they pitched the idea to their Paris manager as a way for students to virtually visit museum galleries.","Addiction.

22,"Second Life Is Plagued by Security Flaws, Ex-Employee Says","A lawsuit filed by the former information security director of Linden Lab—the company behind the online virtual world Second Life, which, yes, is still a thing—claims the company mishandled sensitive user data and turned a blind eye to simulated acts of child molestation and the potential for money laundering.

Paris Martineau covers platforms, online influence, and social media manipulation for WIRED.

In a lawsuit filed in San Francisco County Superior Court on July 30 and served to Linden Lab on Tuesday, Kavyanjali Pearlman, a security researcher who joined Linden Lab from Facebook in 2017, says that she raised these issues during her tenure, and was met with hostility. The suit alleges company executives retaliated against her for flagging cybersecurity risks and potential violations of anti-money-laundering laws, child exploitation, and data misuse.

Pearlman claims the company discriminated against her as a woman, an Indian immigrant, and a Muslim. “After making her concerns known, [she] was treated worse than similarly situated employees who were not immigrant women of color, who were not religiously Muslim and wore a hijab,” says the suit. “Instead of looking into Pearlman’s complaints, Linden Lab’s senior officers led a campaign of retaliation against her, painting her as an inept employee who has issues with communication, and ultimately terminating her employment in March of 2019.”

“While we will fight her alleged claims in court, we deny any allegations that the company has engaged in any illegal activity,” said Linden Lab spokesperson Brett Atwood. “Ms. Pearlman left the company on March 15 only after she was given the opportunity to improve her work performance. We look forward to all the facts coming out in a court of law,” he said, declining additional comment because of the lawsuit.

Linden Lab is best known for Second Life, the massively multiplayer virtual world launched in 2003, which boasted around a million regular users at its peak, and an estimated 800,000 active monthly users as of 2017. Those numbers are paltry compared with today’s social media giants, but it’s still a sizable chunk of people.

A decade ago, Second Life was populated mostly by futurists, brands, and, for some reason, embassies; today, the virtual world occupies a more niche space online. Much of Second Life revolves around the Linden Dollar, a virtual currency with real cash value that is used to buy and sell in-game items, virtual land, and operate or play at virtual “skill gaming” casinos. In 2018, approximately $65 million was paid out to Second Life users for a variety of virtual goods and services. Gaming—including both free-to-play games and “skill” games that offer payouts—was the most popular activity among users, according to Linden Lab.

Last October, Pearlman says she raised concerns with Linden Lab executives that the company was not complying with anti-money-laundering rules, including not required information about the operators of skill games, according to the lawsuit. She says her concerns were dismissed, and that the issues had yet to be addressed by Linden Lab when she left the company in March.

Atwood, of Linden Lab, declined to comment when asked about the accuracy of Pearlman’s description of events. “All Second Life skill gaming operators must provide and verify their identification as part of a rigorous application process,” Atwood told WIRED over email. “We are in compliance with all legal regulations and all skill gaming operators agree to our Terms & Conditions as part of the review and approval process for our Skill Gaming program.”","The potential for money laundering.

23,Why a VR Game About Flirting Is as Scary as a Horror Game,"On the surface, the two PlayStation VR games on display at Sony's Tokyo Game Show booth couldn't be any more different. One is a horror scenario that drops you into a gruesome, terrifying predicament. The other puts you on a beautiful seaside next to an attractive young lady.

But after playing both, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd played the same demo twice. The sheer intimacy of these experiences—the feeling of having one's personal space invaded, if you will—was unmistakeable, and I can still feel it now, at a distance.

A long line stretches to the back of Sony's Tokyo Game Show stand, people patiently awaiting their turn on the 20 or so demo stations of PlayStation VR (nee Project Morpheus), Sony's upcoming virtual reality headset for PlayStation 4. There were many different demos, but those that left the deepest impression on me were Capcom's horror demo Kitchen and Bandai Namco's romance sim Summer Lesson.

I'd already had a lurking-horror experience with Alien: Isolation on Oculus Rift that caused me to seriously contemplate ripping the VR headset off my head midway through. I didn't, but when Kitchen started I felt like maybe this was the time I finally did.

I awoke with my hands bound together—in real life I was holding a PlayStation controller, which of course placed my hands close together, a nice touch—in a dingy room. A man next to me was screaming in my face telling me we had to get out. We did not, because some kind of female ghoul entered the room and killed that guy, but not me. She was all up in my face. Very close.

Then the ghoul left the room. And nothing happened for a while.

My reaction to fake scary things, I have discovered by going to a few of those crazy haunted houses, is to laugh nervously. I was cracking up during Kitchen because Kitchen was some no-holds-barred scary stuff. At one point, I am ashamed to say, some part of the VR rig slipped down and tapped me on the shoulder, making me gasp quite loudly and reach around ready to kill whatever it was.

Then the ghoul left the room. And nothing happened for a while.

This was the scariest thing of all, because I knew something was going to jump out at me. But where? When? In a PlayStation VR demo, when time is of the essence because you move people through as soon as possible, Sony let this go on for a while. Nothing was happening—nothing—and I was as riveted as I've ever been in a game. When I died, following another very up close and personal encounter from which I could not look away, it came as something of a relief.

I didn't expect to feel similarly uncomfortable during Summer Lesson, the pitch for which is you are a teacher providing a private tutoring session to an attractive female student.

'Sensei, how do you read this word?'

Things started off fairly benign, with the student appearing and sitting down next to you, reading from a textbook. You could choose to teach English to a Japanese student in her bedroom, or Japanese to an American student at a beach house. At one point, and this happens in either scenario, the student leans in very close and asks, ""Sensei, how do you read this word?"" Then she places the book in front of your face, leaning into you in what can only be described as an extremely intimate manner.

My heart rate went up. The experience triggered the same alarms that would go off if a real-life stranger got so close I could feel her breath. This goes on for a few minutes, with the student perhaps leaning over you to pick something up, or leaning in to whisper something in a hushed, conspiratorial tone.

It's important to note that this is not about gawking at a virtual woman. Everyone involved is dressed entirely appropriately. There are no bikinis, no peeks up a skirt, nothing like that. This isn't salacious. But it is, quite plainly, erotic. It's supposed to be. The genius of Summer Lesson is how it illustrates the sheer power of virtual reality to not only transport you but to create genuine emotional reactions to what you see. The women in Summer Lesson need not dress provocatively, or talk about sex, or do anything more than get slightly closer than societal convention typically allows.

As in that long stretch of nothing in Kitchen, there's tremendous power in the tiniest interactions. That underscores a counterintuitive truth that makes VR gaming so exciting: Despite its ability to hijack your senses and immerse you in hyper-realism, the real power of VR may lie in its ability to foster quiet intimacy so realistic it's unsettling.","It may make people more uncomfortable with real life interactions. The article describes how both the horror game Kitchen and the romance sim Summer Lesson made the player feel uncomfortable due to the close proximity of the virtual characters.

24,How a Pixar Vet Is Shaping the Future of VR Storytelling,"As we’ve noted many times on this site, virtual reality is the Wild West of filmmaking. From the tech used to make VR films to the scripts that are written for it, everything is new. Luckily for our retinas, a lot of very smart people are trying to figure it out. High at the top of that list: Saschka Unseld, the Pixar veteran who is now the creative director of Oculus Story Studio.

Through the two VR experiences Story Studio has made already—Lost and Henry—and the ones it has forthcoming, Unseld and his team are slowly learning the grammar of what plays well inside a headset. “The way comedy works and the way empathy works is very different in VR than it is in film,” Unseld says in the latest video from the Future of Storytelling.

The biggest things they've learned so far? Make eye contact. Don’t get too close to crying characters. And appreciate that you no longer have a fourth wall. ""That kind of one-on-one relationship that I have in VR is something very primal and you feel like that you don’t have in any other medium,"" Unseld says.

Check out the full interview with Unseld, who will be speaking at the Future of Storytelling summit next month, above.","Virtual reality has the potential to create a more immersive and realistic experience for viewers than traditional filmmaking techniques. However, the technology also has the potential to create a more voyeuristic experience, in which viewers feel like they are intruding on the privacy of the characters in the film.

25,Soundself: A VR Acid Trip Without the Drugs and Flashbacks,"I've never dropped acid. But I did have a memorable drug-induced hallucination once, when I was 7.

I was having a surgical procedure, and as they put the gas mask over my nose and mouth to put me under anesthesia, the physical world quickly dropped away and I was staring at—how the hell do I even describe this?—an array of concentric circles, with harsh brown and yellow stripes, spinning in opposite directions, looking like snakes eating their tails. I remember vividly, too, the moment when they split apart into sections and exploded, slowly, out of my field of view.

Thirty years later, it's clear as day to me. And I thought of it again, playing Robin Arnott's Soundself, a virtual reality ""technodelic"" meant to get players into the same state of mind Arnott felt years ago when he did take acid—and subsequently came to the realization, as you do, that he was one with the entire universe.

Arnott set up a peaceful meditation tent at the PAX East expo in Boston last month, complete with a comfortable rug and a pillow, where I could lay down (praying I didn't contract head lice), put an Oculus Rift on my head, and lose myself in the experience. Talking, or making any sounds at all, changed the series of patterns, lights, sounds, shapes that I saw, merging me and the world around me into a synesthetic collaboration.

""They call it 'ego death,'"" Arnott says. ""Just as when you're dying, as your body is in grave danger, your memory bank facilities dramatically increase, and you remember it in slow motion. The replay of that is like a step-by-step replay of the dissolution of a human being.""

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

""That acid trip gave me my first recognition that every step of that could be facilitated without a drug,"" he continues. ""People who meditate know that you don't need a drug. This game is sort of that step-by-step. An implementation of what it took for me to dissolve and witness myself as what I am.""

My Soundself demo began with the program asking me to ""fill it with my voice."" Talking, humming, or whistling caused the patterns to get larger, more powerful. Eventually the vision began to unfold on its own, without the need for me to make noise. And frankly, I was kind of embarrassed lying down inside a tent with my wife and two strangers, and stopped actually making any sounds. Instead, I simply watched the recursive patterns swallow themselves over and over again, zoned out, and lost track of time. At one point, they actually poked me on the shoulder because they thought I'd fallen asleep—which may bear out *Soundself's *worth as a meditation tool. I wasn't moving, but I was wide awake.

""This is a novelty,"" Arnott says. ""A silly, weird experience."" He's not trying to target people who are already into the idea of ""moving past their ego,"" whether with meditation practices or otherwise. As opposed to the videogames that surrounded us on the PAX show floor, Arnott says, this is technology used not to hook onto your mind, but to let you get out of your head.

I look at it this way: I've already seen the power of VR to transport me, in a way that my brain totally believes is real, to another place. Perhaps VR could also be powerful enough to transport us to a place that is no place at all.",It may be powerful enough to transport us to a place that is no place at all.

26,Using Virtual Reality Underwater Is Weird (but Fun),"“I think there’s a little more of a suspension of disbelief when you’re in a radically different environment,” Greenwood said. “When you don’t have a sense of the ground or gravity or what’s up or what’s down, it makes it that much more believable.”

Their underwater VR gear is nothing more than a rudimentary prototype, but it does work. The computer and display come from a waterproof Android smartphone, which is attached to a 3-D-printed block of plastic that acts as a spacer between the handset and a snorkeling mask. The mask, covered in black tape to keep light from leaking in, has two biconvex lenses—like the ones you’d find in the simple, handheld Google Cardboard—glued to the inside. A plain old snorkel lets you breathe, and audio comes from a Finis underwater MP3 player that uses bone conduction to transmit sound.

They’ve been trying it out at Greenwood’s apartment building, which has a pool (a rarity in San Francisco). On a sunny, chilly afternoon this month, I jumped in and tried it out myself.

The first experience had me floating above the International Space Station while David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” played on a loop. I found that I didn’t want to do much moving; it was relaxing to just hang, suspended in the water (though the visuals made it feel more like outer space), occasionally twisting around to see what was behind, above, or below.

After I’d spent some time checking out the ISS—minutes, probably, but it was hard to tell how much time passed—Greenwood switched to another VR experience that was a little closer to my reality: an underwater scene with colorful fish, peppy jazz music playing in the background. Hanging out with the fish was a little more fun, despite the fact that water started seeping into the snorkel mask as I swam in circles to investigate the world around me.

I quickly realized that the headset is about as advanced as Google Cardboard at this point. There’s head orientation tracking, but no tracking of your head’s position in space. This means you can turn around to look at different things, but your view of the virtual world through the goggles doesn’t change as you swim around.

This is especially weird if you’re making an effort to swim in one direction, as I did while checking out the fish, because the visuals make you feel as if you’re not actually moving even as your arms and legs are flailing. And it means you have no way to know if you’re about to smack into the side of the pool (Greenwood served as my spotter from the pool deck, but every time I touched the rough walls of the pool the spell was momentarily broken).

In hopes of improving this, Greenwood said, he and Evans are working on building a positional tracking system that communicates with the phone in the headset and can work underwater; lights and cameras, which can be used on terra firma, don’t work so well in that setting. He won’t give specifics beyond saying it involves sound and magnetics to calculate depth.

Despite the simplicity of the setup, however, it was easy to forget about the outside world and just enjoy the weird virtual one below the surface. I didn’t stay down there too long—the day was ending and the pool was getting cold—but I’d like to go back soon.","The main unintended consequence of virtual reality, as discussed in the article, is that it can be difficult to tell what is real and what is not. This can be especially confusing and disorienting when you are in a virtual world that is very different from your real world, as is the case with underwater VR. It is also difficult to tell how much time has passed when you are in a virtual world, which can be a problem if you are trying to stay on schedule in the real world.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/02/20/153929/using-virtual-reality-underwater-is-weird-but-fun/,2017-02-20 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.6528768539428711,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,User Experience & Entertainment
27,"In Virtual Reality, Exercise Bike Becomes a Race Car","Inside the headset, VirZoom cofounder and CEO Eric Janzsen challenged me to a race-car race. I leaned to hug corners on tight turns and pedaled faster to speed up my car. When I rolled over what looked through my headset like rougher ground, I was forced to pedal harder to keep up the same pace.

In another game, I became a Pegasus, flying through a world filled with trees and rolling hills. The harder I pedaled, the higher I flew. The game itself was simple and, after a while, a bit boring: I had to find coins and fly through them to gain energy. While I felt my legs growing tired over time, my mind never had time to dwell on the pain of working out.

One VirZoom activity has you drive a race car—you pedal on the bike to control the car’s speed.

Initially, VirZoom will be compatible with three forthcoming virtual-reality headsets—the Oculus Rift, Sony PlayStation VR, and HTC Vive—all of which track head movements to make the leaning motion translate into movement within the game. The bike itself tracks how fast you pedal and can add more resistance based on what avatar you take on or what type of land you travel over.

“We move you through the world in proportion to your effort,” Janzsen says.

The platform will eventually open up to developers, but for now VirZoom is building its first five games from scratch because its team worries the types of motion in existing games could make users sick. That makes sense: early on, leaning too far to the side gave me a twinge of nausea. But as I grew more experienced with the bike, that feeling went away.

Still, purchasing all the gear you’ll need to buy the bike won’t be cheap, and using it will be clunky. While VirZoom will cost $250, buyers will also have to factor in the cost of a headset (still undetermined for the three supported ones, which are all slated for release in 2016). And the Vive and Rift will need to be tethered to a powerful desktop computer, while the PlayStation VR will have to connect to a PlayStation 4.

For now, VirZoom is only planning to sell its bike to people who want to use it at home.

28,Jaguar Land Rover's Virtual Backseat Driver Could Stop You Hitting Cyclists,"Jaguar Land Rover has unveiled a research system that could make sure collisions between Range Rovers and cyclists are a distant memory. ""Bike Sense"" is a new kind of active safety system, combining sight, sound, and touch to tell the driver not just that a potential hazard exists, but what and where it is. Instead of a small flashing icon in the side mirror or a hard to interpret beep offered by current systems, the driver gets blasted with the sound of a bicycle bell, red and yellow LEDs, and a physical tap on the shoulder.

Active safety technologies, which detect and warn drivers about hazards, are increasingly common, especially as more and more cars come stuffed with cameras and radars. These systems are great for getting into tight parking spaces, spotting little kids running across the street, and knowing when there’s someone in your blind spot. But it’s not always easy to understand what, exactly, your car is telling you to watch out for. Blind spot monitoring systems, for example, usually rely on a small icon or light on the side view mirror, but don’t offer context such as what kind of vehicle is there, or how close it is. That leaves the driver to notice the light, interpret it, check the blind spot, and decide what to do.

“If you can bypass that action, so go straight from sensation to action, rather than having to perceive and consider what to do, then you’re gonna create a system that allows drivers to think and act faster,” says Lee Skrypchuk, who leads human machine interface research for Jaguar Land Rover and helped develop Bike Sense.

If you're about to open the door and smack a cyclist, the handle will buzz to warn you. Jaguar Land Rover

The goal of Bike Sense is to create a new interface that communicates the nature and seriousness of risks outside the vehicle. The bicycle bell warning is played from the speaker nearest the hazard. The LEDs that cover the window sills, dashboard, and windshield pillars display a mix of green, yellow, and red, based on how close a cyclist is to the car. The “tap on the shoulder” is a haptic device in the top corners of the driver’s seat: A buzz on the left means watch out on the left. If you're about to open the door and smack a cyclist, the handle buzzes to warn you. It’s like having a backseat driver keeping you up to speed on everything you might knock over and send to the hospital.

Like with a backseat driver, there’s a thin line between helpful advice and just being annoying. Sounding the alarm anytime you’re within a few yards of something can be totally overwhelming, dunking you in a sea of never-ending beeps that make it harder, not easier, to concentrate and drive safely. Finding that balance is a big focus for Jaguar land Rover’s research, Skrypchuk says. The car must get better at understanding the likelihood of a collision, so it can prioritize what the driver needs to be aware of. One potential approach is pulling info from the navigation system: If the driver’s headed left, he should be more aware of a cyclist coming up on the left than one on the right.

Bike Sense is just the latest moderately outlandish technology Jaguar Land Rover has shown off recently, including a virtual imaging system that makes the hood of the car effectively transparent, a 3D instrument cluster, and gesture controls.

This project, from an automaker that sells fewer than 500,000 vehicles a year, and is still in the research phase, won't make a difference to the vast majority of cyclists hit and doored by people in other kind of cars. Protecting all cyclists requires changing laws and infrastructure to slow drivers down and make room for others on the road. But ""technology that places responsibility on motorists and their cars is important,” says Mikael Colville-Andersen, CEO of cycling-focused urban design firm Copenhagenize Design Co. “Any advancement that places the responsibility where it belongs is welcome.”","It could lead to more accidents. If drivers are relying on a virtual reality system to tell them what is happening around them, they may not be paying attention to the road and could cause an accident.",https://www.wired.com/2015/01/jaguar-land-rover-bike-sense/,2015-01-21 20:13:48+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9970976114273072,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
29,The FTC is reportedly probing Meta's VR business for antitrust violations,"Following news that the FTC’s antitrust suit against Meta cleared a critical hurdle earlier this week, the agency is apparently also taking a sharp interest in the company’s VR business.

Bloomberg reports that the FTC and multiple state attorneys general are probing Meta’s virtual reality division for “potential anti-competitive practices.” New York reportedly leads the state-level investigation, which has been chatting up outside software developers who make apps for Meta’s VR experience.

The state and federal officials are examining how the company may have engaged in anti-competitive behavior to suppress competition in the VR market. The officials were also interested in how the company subsidizes the price of its Quest 2 VR headset to push it on consumers and box out the competition, according to Bloomberg.

The fact that the FTC is digging around about Meta’s app store, hardware and software practices suggests that the company’s acquisitions aren’t its only angle in what could be a landmark antitrust case that defines the next era of internet businesses.

In December, The Information reported that the FTC was looking into Meta’s proposed acquisition of Supernatural, a VR fitness app, in a deal worth more than $400 million.

Earlier this week, a judge ruled that the FTC’s major antitrust case against Facebook (owned by parent company Meta) could continue, throwing out the company’s effort to block it. In December, Facebook asked the court to dismiss the suit and pushed for FTC Chair Lina Khan, a proponent of breaking up big tech, to recuse herself.

In that suit, the FTC accuses Facebook of abusing its market power to quell rivals in the social media space and goes as far as asking a judge to make parent company Meta divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp.

“The facts alleged this time around to fortify those theories, however, are far more robust and detailed than before, particularly in regard to the contours of Defendant’s alleged monopoly,” U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote.

“… Although the agency may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations, the Court believes that it has now cleared the pleading bar and may proceed to discovery.”","It may lead to people becoming more isolated from society. If people are spending more time in virtual reality, they will have less time for social interaction in the real world.

30,Darwin Would Have Been a Pokémon Go Master,"As a teenager, Charles Darwin dropped out of medical school because he was too squeamish to handle amputations. He ended up going to Cambridge instead, where he spent hours in the countryside collecting beetles. That’s to say I think Darwin was a nerd, and if he were alive today, he would definitely be trying to catch 'em all.

This is not an idle comparison, made in an attempt to shoehorn Pokémon Go into yet another headline. Please. Because without beetle collectors, the world might have never had Pokémon.

Pokémon’s creator, Satoshi Tajiri, also was an insect collector. His childhood friends called him Dr. Bug. He grew up outside of Tokyo, but as the city encroached on his hometown, the rice paddies, ponds, and forests where he once wandered disappeared. “Places to catch insects are rare because of urbanization,” he would tell Time. “Kids play inside their homes now, and a lot had forgotten about catching insects. So had I.”

So he created Pokémon: ""a virtual world, bursting with fictional biodiversity,"" as Jon Mooallem puts it in his book *Wild Ones *(Mooallem is also WIRED's Mr. Know-It-All columnist). In the '90s, Pokémon meant trading cards, a TV show, and Game Boys that my friends and I spent hours furiously tapping at home, at school, in the car. But with Pokémon Go, that virtual world has been overlaid on the real world. And in venturing outside to look for fictional biodiversity, people are finding real biodiversity.

Twitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Insect collecting was the Pokémon craze of the Victorian era, and Darwin was an obsessive. One time, he recounts in his autobiography, he encountered a third rare beetle, after having already grabbed a beetle in each fist: “I could not bear to lose, so that I popped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth. Alas! It ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the third one.” (Amateur move, like trying to catch Mewtwo with a regular Poké ball.)

Collecting beetles at Cambridge trained Darwin’s patience and his eye for detail, which he later put to use meticulously documenting the beaks of finches and the shells of tortoises in the Galapagos. With Pokémon, Tajiri tapped into that same impulse to collect and to catalogue. You don’t need me to tell you, but Pokémon got so popular that in 2002, British scientists found that children were more likely to recognize fictional Pokémon than oak trees or badgers. ""Conservationists need to reestablish children's links with nature if they are to win over the hearts and minds of the next generation,"" the scientists wrote in their piece. ""Is Ecomon the way ahead?"" Almost certainly not. But then, there’s Pokémon Go.

Over the weekend, Morgan Jackson, a grad student at the University of Guleph, watched the Pokémon Go tweets pile up. Jackson grew up playing Pokémon---he played Red, his brother Blue---so he had spent a lot of time collecting fictional creatures. ""Now I’m an entomologist and I do the same thing except it’s real,"" he says. So he had an idea: #PokéBlitz, a twist on ""bioblitz,"" an event when scientists and volunteers go out to survey the wildlife in an area.","A potential unintended consequence of virtual reality is that it may cause people to lose touch with nature. If people spend too much time in virtual worlds, they may forget about the real world and the importance of conserving it.",https://www.wired.com/2016/07/darwin-pokemon-go-master/,2016-07-12 22:15:56+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.8801369071006775,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Environment & Sustainability
31,An Oculus Rift Hack That Lets You Draw in 3-D,"Facebook's $2 billion acquisition of Oculus Rift has reopened conversation about the potential of virtual reality, but a key question remains: How will we actually interact with these worlds? Minecraft creator Markus Persson noted that while these tools can enable amazing experiences, moving around and creating in them is far from a solved problem.

A group of Royal College of Art students--Guillaume Couche, Daniela Paredes Fuentes, Pierre Paslier, and Oluwaseyi Sosanya--has developed a tool called GravitySketch that starts tracing an outline of how these systems could work as creative tools.

Their high-tech sketchpad looks a bit like a prop from Tron, with its etched grid of transparent plastic and sternly rectilinear user interface panel, but the goal is to make augmented reality feel as natural and organic as sketching in a notebook. Artists hold the acrylic drawing tablet like its analog counterpart and sketch with a custom stylus. Radio frequency sensors record the movements and coordinates on the pad and send them to an Arduino hidden in the black box on its edge. No lines are actually drawn on the pad, but the artist sees them float in air through a pair of augmented reality glasses wirelessly connected to the Arduino.

>The goal was to create tools that would privilege spatial awareness.

The real trick of GravitySketch is that, rather than requiring artists to master tricks like perspective or foreshortening to suggest depth and physicality, they can simply rotate the tablet and draw lines that connect to their previous marks, creating a sense of form in the process. The drawings hang in space, can be approached from any angle, and can be rotated like physical objects.

A solo sketch can quickly become a jam session if several people surround the drawing, allowing people to collaborate in real time with none of the loss that comes from sharing ideas asynchronously and in traditional formats.

Customized software was developed by the team using the game engine Unity 3D. ""We wanted, from the beginning, to have a very minimal user interface,"" says Couche. ""The four of us are users of the conventional CAD tools and having something simple that does not requires you to become an expert in order to create was on strong driver for us."" That's not to say the tools are unsophisticated and sketches drawn in the virtual world can be transformed into 3-D printed objects with ease.

A Textbook Solution

GravitySketch is an impressive tech demo, but the inspiration for it didn't come from a session at Siggraph. Rather, it came from Harvard's education school, where Howard Gardner developed his theory of multiple intelligences. Gardner posits that IQ is too narrow a measure of intelligence, which can be embodied in a variety of ways, from the ability to ace standardized tests to a gift for spatial awareness.

Unfortunately, many potentially gifted designers are scared away from the field because they find the tools intimidating. Reducing three-dimensional forms to drawings is a difficult skill to master, and 3-D CAD programs are obfuscated by complex jargon and user interfaces. CAD enables perfection, but at the cost of imagination and serendipity.

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

The goal here was to create tools that would privilege spatial awareness instead of forcing people through a linguistic and quantitative path that too often favor people with a very specific educational background. ""We are passionate designers; we love imagining and making it real,"" says Couche. ""We felt that something was missing in the tools that are available for creation, and we wanted Gravity to be a something that would stay simple to use.""

Starting with this mission, the team began experimenting with various techniques. The students stumbled upon their solution after drawing shapes on several pieces of plexiglass and stacking them together to create the sensation of an object suspended in the plastic. Instead of making people experts at 3-D, the team realized that its goal should be bringing a familiar 2-D experience to multiple planes. With that insight established, the team started the long process of transforming its concept into a cool tool.

Instead of testing prototypes exclusively with designers and other traditional audiences, the team talked to dancers and musicians to get a sense of their workflow. They were surprised by how such people approached the tool. ""The most interesting is how people use it and what kind of ideas it triggers when they do,"" says Couche. ""For example, we started with the idea to draw volumes in sections and almost accidentally added the possibility to rotate, which now seems very obvious.""

Going Virtual

After experimenting with augmented reality glasses, the team realized virtual reality would alter the experience in interesting ways. So it started reworking the experience, optimizing it for the first generation Oculus Rift developer's kit. ""The level of immersion is so high that you can free your mind and just create,"" says Couche. ""You also lose some of the interaction with the real environment and the conviviality of the multi-user experience."" The experience needs polish, and the team is eager to use the next version, which features head-tracking capabilities. But hardware limitations haven't stopped the team from dreaming up new applications.

Both augmented and virtual reality have their applications with the system. A team of doctors preparing for a complex surgery would be better suited with an AR system that let them draw surgical incisions on a model of a patient, or the patient directly. An architect who sketched out a new doorway would be better suited by the immersive virtual experience provided by VR.

""Now we have a lot of interesting conversations with people who want to do animation with it, on-site design of construction or vehicles, and educational tools,"" says Couche. ""We even discussed with a space exploration expert about the possibilities of visualizing mission architectures and orbital dynamics.""","It may replace traditional forms of communication and interaction. For example, if people are able to communicate and interact with each other in a virtual reality setting, they may be less likely to communicate and interact with each other in person. This could lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and a decrease in the overall quality of human relationships.",https://www.wired.com/2014/04/design-04022014-rift/,2014-04-02 10:30:11+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.994635283946991,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
32,Out in the Open: A Virtual Reality Gadget That Anyone Can Hack,"Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

After a decade on the back burner, virtual reality is hot again. Most of this resurgence is down to Oculus, the headset maker that Facebook acquired for $2 billion this past March, but Sony is also making waves with a forthcoming headset called Project Morpheus.

The rub is that the Oculus only runs games designed specifically for its hardware, and Morpheus won't work with anything but the PlayStation 4. That limits the number of games available to players, and creates more work for the developers interested in creating these types of immersive games.

But a Chinese company called ANTVR thinks it has hit upon a winning strategy for attracting more game developers to this new breed of VR headsets. It's open sourcing part of its headset technology so that it can plug into multiple gaming consoles and even accommodate other kinds of hardware.

The designs for the ANTVR headset itself and its nifty convertible game controller are proprietary technology. But the designs and firmware for the wireless receiver--which sits between the headset, the controller, and the gaming console--are open source. That opens up a range of possibilities, such as creating custom controllers or using the ANTVR controller to control other devices.

>You could write software for using ANTVR to control a Roomba vacuum cleaner robot, perhaps using the headset to watch the feed from the bot's on-board camera.

For example, ANTVR co-founder Qin Zheng says you could write software for using ANTVR to control a Roomba vacuum cleaner robot, perhaps using the headset to watch the feed from the bot's on-board camera. You could also make your own version of the receiver specifically designed to work with a game console or device not officially supported by ANTVR. ""You can use the signal straight from the USB port,"" Zheng says. ""We will give the developer all the documentation and libraries.""

But open source isn't the only way ANTVR plans to attract players and developers. The controller, which can be converted from a directional pad into a gun or light saber, is a major attraction. And Zheng says the headset's aspherical lens will make it possible to display games that weren't designed to work with ANTVR, which is something that Oculus can't do because the spherical lens used by Oculuss distort normal images.

That also makes it harder to develop Oculus games, Zheng says. ""It takes [developers] a lot of work to make their images work with Oculus,"" he says. The aspherical lens should also make it far easier for developer to design games that work with the system. And since it will support Windows, Xbox, PlayStation, and Android out of the box, both players and developers will have plenty of options.

One challenge the company will face, though, is building trust as a newcomer to market. And after the Oculus acquisition, you might expect the gaming community to be cautious about crowdfunding another virtual reality platform. Zheng downplays that possibility. ""We won't sell the company,"" he says. ""I don't think there is a very appropriate company who can work with us to finish our dream of the virtual reality.""

We'll have to wait and see about that, but ANTVR has already raised over $177,000 dollars on Kickstarter and is well on its way to raising its goal of $200,000. That may have something to do with the price: the sets are being pre-sold at cost, which is $300, in order to get a foothold in the market.

Next, Zheng says the company will bring its own smart glasses product to market, which is what he actually set out to do a few years ago when he started working with head mounted displays. The glasses and the virtual reality system share the same goal. ""I want it to be universal hardware for a lot of developers, makers and ordinary gamers,"" he says. ""I wanted it to be open for everyone.""","It may cause people to become more isolated from real life social interactions. This is because people will be spending more time in virtual reality environments where they can interact with other people in a more controlled setting.

33,Can Virtual Reality Improve People’s Real Lives?,"Psychiatric Progress

Early research shows that immersive virtual reality may help psychologists reduce paranoid thoughts in patients by improving their self-esteem. In one study, researchers in the U.K. and Spain invited 60 women who had recently had paranoid thoughts to wear a headset that projected scenes of a train ride. They took the ride twice, experiencing it at their normal height and at a level that made them feel shorter. While previous research has indicated a correlation between height and self-esteem or social status, these results showed that reducing the virtual height of the riders increased their paranoia and negative views of themselves. Many of the participants did not notice the height difference but nonetheless reported feeling more uncomfortable in the scenario where they rode the train at a lower height. The researchers are now testing whether making someone taller in virtual reality increases self-esteem, which could help boost confidence and reduce the tendency to have paranoid thoughts, clinical psychology professor Daniel Freeman explains in a blog post. The findings were published in August in Psychiatry Research. Furthermore, immersive virtual reality could be used to help predict the severity of paranoia and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to an article published online in the American Psychological Association’s Psychological Assessment in April.

Dealing with PTSD

Combining virtual reality with medication has helped veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars recover from PTSD, Emory University researchers say. In a study of 156 veterans with PTSD from combat, each person received six sessions of virtual-reality exposure lasting 30 to 45 minutes. Through a headset, patients experienced scenes of streets in Iraq and Afghanistan from the perspective of a driver, passenger, or pedestrian. Before the session, the veterans took a placebo pill or one of two types of drugs. The researchers found that a combination of virtual reality and a drug sometimes administered in cognitive behavioral therapy decreased PTSD symptoms for more than a year. Combining the virtual-reality sessions with an antianxiety drug also helped, but not as much as a placebo. The study is explained in the April 18 edition of the American Journal of Psychiatry. Emory professor Barbara Rothbaum explains some virtual-reality treatments in this video.

Pedestrian Behavior

If architects and city planners could better model how crowds move through urban environments, they might find ways to make cities more amenable to large groups of people. They also could develop better signs and guidance for people with visual impairments, like a system that gives commands to help them merge with a crowd. Brown University’s Virtual Environment Navigation Laboratory has been studying the dynamics of crowds using Oculus Rift VR headsets modified to work wirelessly. A test subject walks around the Brown lab while wearing the headset and must react to virtual scenarios like a crowded train station or a group passing by in the opposite direction. Researchers have found that people generally match the speed and direction of others in the crowd, but further research will examine how they behave in unusual situations like an evacuation. In particular, the researchers could test the counterintuitive idea that putting a partition near an evacuation exit actually prevents bottlenecks, says William Warren, the Brown professor leading this research. Findings were published in the Journal of Vision in February, and this video explains more about the process.

The Takeaway:

Because researchers are able to modify virtual environments to test for different variables, they are able to observe situations that would be difficult or impossible to create in real life. Virtual reality may also hold promise for making everyday situations more bearable. For example, the E.U. is funding a project to reduce the anxiety of airline passengers with calming virtual images.

34,Virtual Reality’s Latest Use? Diagnosing Mental Illness,"Diagnosing psychiatric and neurological conditions is tricky. Physicians have long reported that diagnoses are fraught with complications and subtleties. Anywhere from 35 percent to 85 percent of mental health conditions go undetected and undiagnosed, according to the World Health Organization, depending on where you live on the planet. Needless to say, to treat depression, Alzheimer's, or autism, it must first be detected.

Now clinicians and researchers are trying a new tool: virtual reality. VR has been touted as a promising means of treating some conditions, but it also may help diagnose them. As a diagnostic tool, VR potentially offers some big advantages: It can create convincingly realistic simulations of experiences that may provoke symptoms, and it can do so consistently, potentially making diagnoses more objective—or at least less subjective.

A scene from the virtual environment devised by Dennis Chan and his colleagues as part of their study into VR and Alzheimer's. Dennis Chan

In September, the UK-based Alzheimer's Society said it would fund a three-year research project using VR to try to detect early signs of Alzheimer's disease. In an initial study, researchers led by Cambridge University's Dr. Dennis Chan tested participants’ spatial navigation and memory by having them don a HTC Vive headset, follow an L-shaped path in a virtual environment (initially mapped out by cones), and then trace their footsteps back to their starting point without the help of any markers.

In a paper describing preliminary results, Chan’s team reported that the VR-based navigation test was more accurate in diagnosing mild Alzheimer’s-related impairment than traditional “gold-standard” cognitive tests, such as figure recall and symbol tests. In an email, Chan says VR could take on a bigger role in diagnosing mental disorders as VR gear becomes cheaper and easier to use.

Treating PTSD

Researchers at Emory University in Atlanta have used VR to diagnose and treat veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder related to sexual trauma while in the military. Participants were shown two-minute clips of a simulated foreign military base and a typical American city, while researchers monitored their heart rate and “startle” responses. In a paper published last year, the researchers reported significant reductions “in clinician-assessed and self-reported PTSD symptoms.”

VR is a promising diagnostic tool, researchers say, because it generates scenarios and experiences that can't easily be produced in a traditional clinical setting. “VR provides a unique opportunity to bring real-life experiences into the clinician’s office,” explains Dr. Martine van Bennekom, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam’s Department of Psychiatry. “With some psychiatric disorders, for example OCD or panic disorder, patients usually experience their symptoms in their personal environment or in crowded places, and not in the clinician’s room. With VR it is possible to immerse patients in an exterior environment while the clinician can observe symptoms and interview the patients about these symptoms and underlying thoughts.”

Moreover, VR can generate a highly regular, controlled experience, providing the scientific consistency that’s often lacking in the doctor’s office. “Content can be created to exact specifications and experienced in the exact same way every time,” says Eric Abbruzzese, a VR analyst at ABI Research, via email. ""Everything is digital so parameters can be controlled to a near infinite level.”

Beyond Alzheimer’s and PTSD, VR is now also being tested for diagnosing a variety of other conditions, such as social anxiety disorder, vertigo, ADHD, and concussions. For example, a team from Exeter University reported in 2017 that a VR-based “mirror game,” which required participants to duplicate the movements, gestures, and facial expressions of a virtual avatar, helped early diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Dr. Piotr Slowinski, the leader of the Exeter team, says via email that mental health practitioners have approached the group about employing the mirror game, and that the group is testing a prototype to further assess the idea. He says the practitioners are excited about the prospect of diagnosing schizophrenia earlier in young adults, because earlier detection and treatment tend to lead to better outcomes.","The potential for VR to be used as a tool for diagnosing mental disorders. While VR has the potential to provide a more objective and consistent diagnosis, it also has the potential to be used as a tool for diagnosing mental disorders that may not be accurately represented in VR.

35,Metaverse breached: Second Life customer database hacked,"High profile virtual reality game Second Life reported today that one of its databases containing unencrypted user information was breached two days ago. The company confirmed that this is the first time user data has been breached since the service opened for public use in 2003. The database did not include customer credit card numbers, a requirement to register for the game (correction, that’s not the case anymore), as they were kept in a different database. The breached database did include unencrypted names and addresses, and the encrypted passwords and encrypted payment information of all Second Life users.

A company representative wouldn’t tell me whether behavioral or attention data tied to users was exposed in the breach, but did say that to the best of their knowledge none of that data had been captured. Such data could include information about embarrassing activities in Second Life that users may not like to have tied to their real life selves. There’s a lot of very cool things that go on in Second Life, but there’s also a lot of sex and gambling. Update: Vladimir Cole at AOL’s gamer blog, Joystiq, a better authority on the particulars here than me – concurs (emphasis mine). “To put a finer point on it,” he writes, “what happens when archived MMOG chat logs are breached? It’s going to be ugly, like AOL ugly: ‘I swear honey, that Furry [avatar] meant nothing to me. It was totally just research for my new book. I’ll sell the teledildonics equipment on eBay first thing tomorrow.'”

Virtual worlds are big, they’re going to get bigger, and we should be demanding protection of user data from those worlds now. There’s already one politician said to be a possible US Presidential contender campaigning in Second Life, you can participate in American Cancer Society fund raisers, hang with the American Library Association or participate in substantial daily commerce. There are major corporations launching advertising initiatives in Second Life and consultancies forming to facilitate such activities. Acts of violence in a game that prohibits it are being reported with increasing frequency. This is serious stuff.

Apparently our Second Lives aren’t as separate from the rest of the world as we might have liked to think. Obviously no company is immune from such security attacks, but there’s something about the supposed freedom from consequences in Second Life that this calls into question. It’s been a rough week for privacy, considering the Facebook explosion, Craigslist sex baiting and HP spy scandal.

The security breach occurred on Wednesday and users were required to change their passwords at 9:30 am PST this morning. Mark Wallace at 3pointD writes, “Oddly, it seems that no notice was sent to users flagging the problem.”

One source told us that the entry into the database appears to have occurred via an exploit in Tikiwiki, a third party open source collaboration service that the company has since stopped using. The company was hesitant to disclose information about the breach, the data put at risk and the company’s architecture for fear that such information could make future exploits easier to perform.

Though far from the largest virtual reality game online, Second Life has gained loads of media attention (including the front cover of Business Week) because of the diversity of participants and the dynamic economic activity that goes on in the game. There are an estimated 3,000 users who make at least $20,000 per year from businesses in Second Life and the company’s founder recently said that between seven and eight million US dollars in real money changes hands each month in the game. Investors in Linden Lab, the company behind Second Life, include Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and Globespan Capital Partners.



Though this wasn’t the first time a virtual reality game has been hacked and user data has been put at risk, it’s notable because of the number of nontraditional gamers who participate in Second Life and the discourse around it in particular as a symbol of online life to come. The number of registered Second Life users has doubled over the last two months.","The potential for users' personal information and data to be accessed and exploited without their knowledge or consent.

36,Google Thinks It Has Cracked the VR Adoption Problem,"Google has already put in a lot of work and money in hopes of bringing virtual-reality technology to the mainstream, through efforts like Google Cardboard—a foldable VR viewer that works with a smartphone—and, more recently, the more capable but still phone-dependent Daydream VR platform.

Yet while over 10 million of the Cardboard viewers have shipped since it was released in 2014, and there are about 150 apps out for the Google-made Daydream headset that shipped late last year, consumer adoption has been slow going. About 10 million headsets shipped globally last year, according to IDC, a market researcher, which is just a tiny fraction of the 1.5 billion smartphones that shipped in the same time frame.

There are lots of reasons why people aren’t buying into the technology. It’s isolating, and there aren’t a ton of things to do. All of the high-end headsets need to be connected to a computer or gaming console, and it’s annoying to feel cords flying around on your back and shoulders when you’re trying to forget about actual reality and explore, say, Mars in VR. And it’s expensive—a typical headset and its required computing platform will cost you anywhere from about $750 to well over $1,000, depending on what you’re buying.

Google is chipping away at the clunky and expensive issues by working with chipmaker Qualcomm to come up with a reference design for a wireless VR headset, and the company says that HTC and Lenovo are working with Google and building VR headsets like this.

The first of these headsets is expected to be available later this year, and Mike Jazayeri, Daydream’s director of product management, expects they will be priced similarly to desktop-connected VR devices today, minus the price of a PC—so, probably around $600 to $800.

“There’s just less friction. Put the headset on and you’re ready to go,” Jazayeri said.

I got to try an older prototype of one of these headsets this week, watching a short scene from the Star Wars film Rogue One to show off another innovation Google will roll out—a software tool called Seurat that can show desktop-computer-quality graphics on mobile VR devices by simplifying a given scene, computation-wise. The headset was fairly comfortable, with a wheel-style adjustment on the back of my head, and the imagery looked impressively crisp, even when I spun around or kneeled down on the ground to see the reflections better on the shiny virtual floor. When I moved too far in one direction or another, the world around me darkened to let me know I shouldn’t go any farther.

Google’s wireless plan could be a big deal for the VR industry. While several wireless virtual-reality headsets have been shown off that seek to marry high-end visuals and head tracking with a wireless design, they haven’t come out yet, and the ones that are wireless, like Google’s existing Daydream View and Samsung’s Gear VR, aren’t nearly as capable and won’t work without a really good smartphone.","The main unintended consequence of virtual reality discussed in the article is that it is isolating. People who use virtual reality headsets are cut off from the outside world and are unable to interact with other people. This can lead to people feeling lonely and isolated, and it can also make it difficult for them to socialize and make friends.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/05/18/151626/google-thinks-it-has-cracked-the-vr-adoption-problem/,2017-05-18 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9958600401878356,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,User Experience & Entertainment
37,A Pixar-Inspired Projector That Beams VR Into an Entire Room,"Virtual reality can make you feel like you're high atop the Wall in Westeros, flying like a bird, or running from an alien intent on killing you, but to everyone else, you look like a spaz flailing about in high-tech ski googles. This makes demonstrating a head-mounted display like the Oculus Rift difficult in a group setting. You can set up a monitor that displays what you're seeing, but the result is an underwhelming pair of screenshots. Hardly the immersive experience VR promises.

That's the insight behind a slick projector called Immersis that demonstrates the panoramic power of VR en masse.

Immersis turns an entire room into a display for VR video games. Catopsys

Immersis' projector was designed to look like a cross between the Pixar lamp's evil twin and a tripod from the *War of the Worlds. Its *single fish-eye lens beams a 180 degree VR experience into an interior space. Instead of a pair of small, stereoscopic images, your entire field of view is filled with immersive scenes from a virtual world. It can't provide the simulation of three dimensions that someone wearing the googles enjoys, others in the room experience a scene that spills off the screen and onto walls, doors, the dog, and anything else in the room.

The goal is to foster the expansion of VR while making it less solitary. There are entire genres of party games that wouldn't port well to virtual reality; Immersis helps cross that chasm.

The Immersis projector was designed to look like a cross between an evil twin of Pixar's lamp mascot and a tripod from the War of the Worlds. Its industrial design is slick, but the setup process is a little clunky. To get the most impact from the system, users have to create a 3-D model of the space where the HMD and Immersis will be used. Only then can it apply anamorphosis algorithms to distort the video game graphics so that they'll look correct when projected onto irregular walls and objects.","Its potential to isolate people from one another. When people put on VR headsets, they are effectively shutting out the world around them and isolating themselves in a virtual one.

38,"VR’s True Innovation Isn’t Technological, It’s Human","I've never seen anything in VR quite as realistic as this car. It's like something out of the future, all chrome and curves; the lights of the Berlin platz twinkle off it as it rotates slowly in front of me, and even the writing on its tires is crisp and legible. But when I crouch down to take a closer look, something brushes against my leg. The visual experience is so real, for a nanosecond it seems like there's another person admiring with me. But no—it's the cable connecting my headset to the computer that powers it.

Welcome to VR's leading edge; please don't mind the tether.

Togetherness is play, without a script. And play is movement, either on the micro scale of nonverbal communication or across an entire room.

Today's newest headsets have features that seem to have leaped over from sci-fi. Yet the most amazing of them—from eye-tracking tech to the sleek Scandinavian gøggles I used to ogle the car, which pack in so many pixels the display looks indistinguishable from real life—are units shackled to computers and reserved for corporate use, the so-called enterprise market. In other words, even if you're the earliest of early adopters, you're not likely to be slipping one of these headsets on anytime before 2025's Star Wars Episode XII: Porg-y and Bespin, the Musical. But maybe that's not such a bad thing. As consumers, what we want from VR and what we need from VR don't always overlap—and in the next couple of months, Oculus and HTC Vive will both release all-in-one, fully immersive headsets that make that clear.

“How do you use VR?” is a valuable question with answers that are dueling opposites. It's public or it's private, professional or personal, purpose or play. There's your crux. “Play” means not just the games that spurred VR's early growth but also the increasing desire to share unstructured social time with other people. Togetherness is play, without a script. And play is movement, either on the micro scale of nonverbal communication or across an entire room. That's where the Oculus Quest and HTC Vive Focus Plus come in. Both offer three distinct advantages over nearly every other headset—including those new enterprise models. They're self-contained, so you're not attached by a cable to a computer or game console; they track themselves in space, obviating the external sensors required on earlier systems and freeing you to move about in VR just as you move in real life, with a range limited only by your physical environment; and they extend the headset's “six degrees of freedom” to the hand controllers as well, allowing for realistic use of virtual objects like swords and flashlights.

We've never seen this holy trinity of immersion. I've worn the Quest to play VR tennis on the floor of an expo hall in a space that was 20 feet across and three times as long, sprinting along the baseline while my very human opponent was doing the same about 20 steps away. Our rackets were our handheld controllers; the ball was virtual. We both worked up a sweat, and when he trounced me, the smack talk was as giddy as the game itself. If that sounds like a trifle, it should; it's a supersized extrapolation of why the Nintendo Wii was such a phenomenon. You want VR to go big? Make it something people have never been able to do before—ride a dinosaur, walk around on Mars, deep-sea dive with no equipment—and let them do it with other people.

If you've read a blog comment thread recently, you've likely heard another story. These headsets can't match a PC's performance! Without this resolution or that field of view (and the price tag to match), the technology is a nonstarter. Such critiques miss the point. VR isn't just a technology; it's a conduit of connection. Any headset that brings people together is a perfect headset.

Still, the success of these devices is by no means assured. For all the cord-free, backpack-friendly elements of the Focus Plus, HTC considers it a consumer headset for China only; it will launch in the US strictly as an enterprise device. But while it might seem that the best stuff is reserved for offices, the opposite is true: Those poor schmucks are enjoying lifelike VR, but they're glued to their workspaces. And who wouldn't trade a few pixels for one more precious degree of freedom?

39,Bank Failure in Second Life Leads to Calls for Regulation,"The recent collapse of Ginko Financial, a ""virtual investment bank"" in Second Life, has spurred calls for more oversight, transparency and accountability, especially when it comes to business practices in the metaverse.

Last week, Ginko Financial -- an unregulated bank that promised investors astronomical returns (in excess of 40 percent) and was run by a faceless owner whose identity is still a mystery -- announced it would no longer exist as a financial entity.

The declared insolvency meant the bank would be unable to repay approximately 200,000,000 Lindens (U.S. $750,000) to Second Life residents who had invested their money with the bank over the course of its three and a half years of existence.

""You have to remember, there's not a lot of places to put your money in Second Life,"" said Benjamin Duranske, a lawyer who publishes Virtually Blind, a blog that chronicles virtual laws and legal issues that impact worlds like Second Life. ""When you have disposable income and a bank that's promising a 60 percent return on deposits, that alluring -- especially if it works for a while.""

Quickly following this news, a tidal wave of backlash took shape from thousands of angry Second Lifers in SL forums.

Yet in many ways, the undoing of Ginko and the collective loss of more than 750,000 very real U.S. dollars is only the latest event hammering home the fact that the lawlessness of the virtual land has its drawbacks. Indeed, after Linden Lab, the owner and operator of Second Life, invited the FBI to investigate casino activity, the company subsequently instituted a ban on all gambling earlier this month.

On Tuesday, Linden Lab itself issued a statement trying to clarify its stance on regulations and Second Life's virtual economy.

""Linden Lab does not intend to recreate or subvert real-world laws in any way,"" the statement says. ""We caution our residents to be wary of anyone offering extremely high interest rates at no risk, either in the real world or in Second Life -- if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.""

The response was timely, considering Second Life currently has 20 to 30 banks that operate essentially the same way Ginko did. That fact, plus the large losses associated with Ginko, has led to a growing call for even more transparency and regulation among SL residents.

Duranske is at the forefront of the movement. An intellectual property lawyer who's taking time off from his practice to work on a book about virtual law, he was one of the first people to jump on the shady business dealings at Ginko Financial more than two months ago. Indeed, his blog has one of the most comprehensive accounts of Ginko's downfall.

Duranske claims he's personally talked with a few SL residents who have lost as much as $10,000 in the Ginko scheme, but estimates that the majority lost a more moderate amount--somewhere in the range of $50 to $100.

""A lot of people forget, Second Life is governed by U.S. law and the laws of California,"" Duranske explained. ""It just so happens that these laws haven't been enforced.""","People are losing real money in virtual schemes. While it is possible to make a lot of money in virtual reality, it is also possible to lose a lot of money.

40,A Holodeck Videogame Designed to Train Soldiers,"If the Army is going to keep up with military readiness pressures while also seeing a reduction in troop size and stagnant budgets, then it's going to need more cutting-edge videogames.

Last week, the Army Contracting Command issued a Sources Sought notice for companies interested in demonstrating ""mature technologies"" for military training. Northrop Grumman thinks its Virtual Immersive Portable Environment (VIPE) Holodeck just may be the answer.

Using commercial, off-the-shelf hardware combined with gaming technology, the VIPE Holodeck 360 degree virtual training system provides users with a high-fidelity immersive environment with a variety of mission-centric applications, including simulation and training, mission rehearsal and data visualization. The VIPE Holodeck can support live, virtual and constructive simulation and training exercises including team training, cultural and language training and support for ground, air and remote platform training. Off-the-shelf technology keeps costs down while also making future upgrades and maintenance easy to perform and affordable, says Northrop.

Last year, the VIPE Holodeck took first place in the Federal Virtual Challenge for the navigation category, an annual competition led by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Simulation and Training Technology Center, for the system's Kinect integration navigation sensor, which gives users the ability to crawl, walk, run, stop, jump, move side to side in the immersive environment.

Where the VIPE Holodeck moves ahead of other virtual simulators, according to Northrop, is advanced situational training where service members can walk through an area of operation in the replicated virtual environment to prepare themselves for what they may encounter in that exact environment in reality. To enhance that training, operators can drop threats into the environment, including IEDs and enemy shooters, as well as signals that should tip them off to potential threats and see how they respond before they actually find themselves in that situation.

And it's precisely that versatility that the Army is after.

""For us to be able to execute realistic training -- good training -- we have to be able to bring that operational environment"" into the virtual world, said Brig. Gen. Michael Lundy, deputy commanding general at the Army Combined Arms Center, during the AUSA Aviation symposium earlier this month. ""We want to get away from having multiple environments, virtual gaming and instruction, and go to one synthetic environment, get to a lower overhead and integrate the full operations process ... according to the common operating picture.""

""The great thing about virtual reality and gaming technology [is that] it's moving so rapidly that really it has endless possibilities that we can do,"" said Ryan Frost, Northrop's program manager for the VIPE Holodeck. ""If you can think it, we can create it, eventually.""

Northrop says it's also exploring options for VIPE as a stepping stone to live-training within the medical field, as well as law enforcement and first responders for situations such as live-shooter or hostage scenarios.","It may lead to soldiers becoming more desensitized to violence. With the ability to drop threats into the environment, including IEDs and enemy shooters, as well as signals that should tip them off to potential threats and see how they respond before they actually find themselves in that situation, soldiers may become less responsive to real life violence.",https://www.wired.com/2014/01/holodeck/,2014-01-28 14:30:07+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9952788352966307,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
41,Virtual Reality Actually Feels Real When It Uses Physics,"There is already some such software meant to simulate physics in two-dimensional video games, but He argues that’s focused more on simulating environments and reproducing how shapes like balls and triangles collide with each other in order to approximate things like explosions. He says his company concentrates on re-creating the bones, skeletons, and underlying structures of things that can walk or otherwise move, whether they’re virtual humans, dogs, robots, or cars, and simulating how they should get around and what should happen when a user pokes or prods them.

He hopes his company’s software finds uses beyond just games in VR. For instance, he thinks it could make it feel more natural to socialize with other people’s digital avatars in virtual environments—something that’s in its infancy as companies like AltspaceVR let users of headsets like Vive and the Oculus Rift connect with others.

He says the company will soon start letting some developers try out a beta version of part of its software, and he expects the rest to be released next year. The company is also planning to make VR games and put them online so anyone with a headset can try them out.","It has the potential to make people more isolated from each other.

42,The UN's New VR Doc Exposes a Forgotten Crisis,"The United Nations will, unfortunately, never run out of international issues to address. Whether in response to war, viruses, refugee crises, or other urgent situations, the agency's peacekeeping and humanitarian aid efforts are ongoing worldwide almost constantly. That means a lot of help in a lot of places—and it also means that public perception of the UN’s work is often defined by the crisis of the moment. The organization’s latest virtual reality documentary was made to change that.

Ground Beneath Her is about Nepal, and specifically about how one family is rebuilding after the 2015 earthquake that killed more than 8,000 people and left some 3 million displaced. It doesn’t take viewers into the aftermath; it just shows them one 14-year-old girl trying to help her family rebuild. Gabo Arora, the UN creative director who made the film, did so at the behest of the UN Development Programme, which has been working in the region since the quake—and needs help.

“The UNDP said, ‘We really would like to help you fund something,’” Arora says. “And I said, ‘What would you like me to do?’ And they said, ‘Nepal, because we’re still there a year later and we’d like to shine a light on this issue.’”

That’s why Arora’s experience, which you can download today on the UNVR app, is a time-lapse of the life of Sabita, a young girl who has taken up blacksmithing to help her family. The trade, which is normally considered the work of the lower classes in Nepal, has become invaluable as part of the rebuilding efforts, but doing it has pulled Sabita, who wants to be a doctor, away from her education.

The VR film itself is a way for people to experience the life of someone surviving after a disaster; the bulk of it just allows viewers to watch Sabita as she completes the many tasks of her day. It’s not terribly exciting, but it’s a good reminder that areas in crisis still need assistance even after a crisis is no longer in the headlines. (The experience also ends with a call-to-action for people to donate to rebuilding efforts.)

That approach is slightly different than some of the UN’s other VR films, like Waves of Grace, which looked at Ebola in Libera, or My Mother’s Wing, which followed a family living in Gaza. “Nepal is a challenge because Syria is topical, Ebola is topical, Gaza [is topical],” Arora says. “Nepal wasn’t in the news, and I think that’s why we tried to take a little bit more of an artistic approach with it.”

Looking at Arora’s work with UNVR a trend becomes clear: his subjects have all been women. This is mostly a coincidence, but the director has his reasons. “We’re here to tell stories of people who are generally more marginalized.” he says. “But when I got into VR, I realized it’s very unforgiving to ugliness—and a lot of women in these situations show grace and power and strength.” And for the UN, helping young women like Sabita ensures that that grace and power lasts for generations to come.","It can take people away from their education.

Nearly six months ago, Oculus came to the Sundance Film Festival to announce its new ""storytelling"" division, Oculus Story Studio. They screened a compelling, Pixaresque short called Lost, and claimed that they were hard at work on five titles. At the time, that workload for a small crew of creatives sounded a little ambitious---even if those creatives were part of a multibillion-dollar Facebook-owned virtual reality company.

44,"Experimenting With Virtual Reality, Financial Services Enter The Matrix","“You take the blue pill –- the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill -– you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”

Morpheus and The Matrix introduced virtual reality (VR) to a mass audience, and the technology — once largely the domain of the entertainment industry — is now poised to reinvent a range of industries, from healthcare and the military to education and financial services.

VR technology appeals to industry because it has the potential to improve the user experience by transforming uninspiring or complicated content into a vivid, immersive experience. This opportunity is particularly relevant to the financial industry, because it represents a new channel for financial services providers -– such as wealth managers, brokerage firms and personal bankers — to deliver financial content in a novel and easily consumable visual format.

The Millennial Opportunity

The generation driving greater adoption of VR technology is the same generation that grew up on video games and films such as The Matrix and Minority Report — millennials. This new generation of consumers is known for its willingness to embrace new technologies, as well as the risks they bring. Roughly one in every three U.S. workers is a millennial; by 2025 they will make up 75 percent of the national workforce. These workers are now using their newfound wealth and influence to drive change in many industries, particularly financial services.

There are 84 million millennials in the U.S. alone, making it the largest generation in American history. According to the Millennial Disruption Index, a three-year study that surveyed 10,000 millennials about 73 companies spanning 15 industries, the banking sector was found to be at the highest risk of disruption.

Millennials have deep-seated issues with the retail-banking customer experience, according to the study. Whether it’s applying for a loan or signing up for a credit card, millennials aren’t particularly inclined to visit a bank branch, especially now that they can do most of their banking on a mobile device. However, they will likely still need the professional financial advice for key life events, like taking on a mortgage or establishing a family trust.

This loss of confidence in the traditional pillars of the financial system has seen many millennials voting with their wallets by taking their business to non-banks and startups.

VR, with its ability to immerse the user in a rich, lifelike experience, offers one possible passageway to help long-established financial institutions fight back against the erosion of their core, wage-earning customer base.

This shift has put banks and other financial services providers under considerable competitive pressure, but it has also presented them with an opportunity to re-evaluate the way in which they engage younger consumers. VR, with its ability to immerse the user in a rich, lifelike experience, offers one possible passageway to help long-established financial institutions fight back against the erosion of their core, wage-earning customer base.

Engaging Customers With Virtual Reality

There is ample evidence that customers are willing to engage more with their banks if provided with a better overall level of service. VR technology has the potential to function as just such a benefit, augmenting traditional brick-and-mortar banking activities, while implanting the customer in a highly immersive environment.

Several financial institutions have already taken the first steps toward adopting VR technology. In late 2014, the R&D lab of one firm launched an investment tool that combines VR with data visualization. The experimental investment app is designed to improve the customer experience by transforming blocks of data into a more immersive trading environment, with the portfolio representing a city and each position representing a building.

Meanwhile, researchers at a large European bank are also testing VR technology as a tool for their wealth managers to better attract young clients and help them visualize complex investment portfolios. These researchers argue that time-strapped millennials may be more willing to interact with their bank remotely rather than flying across the continent for a private lunch.

Another prominent investment bank is applying VR technology to wealth management with the release of an interactive retirement planning application that helps users visualize their journey toward retirement. Early studies of the application are proving that consumers, when shown computer-generated versions of themselves at retirement age, are more willing to accept later financial rewards over immediate ones.

VR also has the potential to be a transformative technology for banks entering emerging markets. Rather than investing time and capital building brick-and-mortar branches, they can improve efficiency and engagement by bringing VR headsets directly to target markets. This way a customer in an emerging market can enjoy the same banking experience as a customer in a developed market. One Asian bank is already exploring the potential of VR technology by creating a digital platform that allows customers to remotely carry out traditional banking activities.

Others in the financial space are using VR to help design new workplaces with a view toward making them more customer-friendly. One large firm that specializes in tax preparation recently built a virtual mock-up of a new office layout and invited customers and employees to put on a VR headset and test it out — not unlike stepping inside an architectural rendering.

Research conducted at Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab has shown that making the cause and effect relationship perceptual, as opposed to theoretical, changes consumer behavior more than other interventions. This corroborates the frequently cited statistic from Dr. Albert Mehrabian that 93 percent of all daily communication is nonverbal, which shows that humans rely on multiple senses to better process information and make decisions. VR, if effectively applied, holds the potential to maximize customer engagement by emphasizing the visual elements of an interactive banking experience.

By transforming the consumer banking experience using VR technology, retail banks have the potential to stimulate greater — and potentially more profitable — customer engagement.

Virtual Reality Climbs The Adoption Curve

Fortunately for financial services providers, VR technology is among the few hot solutions that can boast awareness among millennials. The gaming industry’s early attraction to VR has created a crowd of early adopters, who will help evangelize the adoption of VR in banking. Already, there are many signs that the technology is climbing the adoption curve toward mainstream acceptance.

According to a recent BI Intelligence report, shipments of VR headsets are estimated to increase at a 99 percent compound annual growth rate between 2015 and 2020, making it a potentially $2.8 billion hardware market. The software market, which includes games and other applications, could be even larger. Supporting this growth is a handful of major manufacturers, each with the resources and experience necessary to scale the technology commercially and keep costs reasonably low.

In the Age of the Customer, empowered buyers can demand — and often receive — a new and improved level of personalized service. With VR technology now both affordable and functional, financial services providers should think of VR not just as an opportunity to showcase their ability to innovate, but also as an opportunity to transform the customer experience. VR banking provides a path for banks and other financial service providers — both innovators and technology laggards — to capture market share with millennials and future generations. Those who ignore this opportunity risk suffering the same fate as other companies and industries that were too late to adapt to seismic technological disruptions.

As Morpheus said in The Matrix, “There’s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.” It’s time banks walk the path and accept virtual reality as a promising feature of the future banking experience.","The potential for financial institutions to use VR technology to take advantage of consumers. For example, by using VR to create a more immersive and lifelike experience, financial institutions may be able to more easily sell products or services to customers that they may not otherwise be interested in.

46,I Had a Sword Fight With a Giant in PlayStation VR's Golem,"Jaime Griesemer, one of the original designers of Microsoft's mega-hit Halo and a veteran of many other massive games, says he has one failing as a designer: He hates solving a problem the same way twice.

""It drives people nuts,"" he says. ""We already have a solution that works, and I'm like, Yeah, but this one is new! So I'm at my best when I'm in an environment where there are all new problems.""

That desire to tackle a different set of problems led Griesemer and his colleagues to virtual reality. During last week's PlayStation Experience in San Francisco, Sony unveiled a quick teaser for Golem, a first-person VR action game from Highwire Games, a tiny new studio created by Griesemer, the renowned Halo composer Marty O'Donnell, and a handful of veterans of triple-A games eager to escape the bloated teams that create most blockbusters.

""When I started on Halo, it was seven guys. When I stopped working on Halo, it was 350 guys,"" Griesemer says. ""It's just not as much fun working on a giant team.""

With the flexibility to create any game imaginable, Highwire came up with Golem, a game about making, then inhabiting the bodies of, automatons great and small. No one is saying much more than that. ""There are golems, and there are people that can control them, and that's about all I can say."" Griesemer says.

Playing Golem

Griesemer, O'Donnell, and Highwire technical director Jared Noftle let me try it after PlayStation Experience, though. I donned a PlayStation VR headset, and someone handed me a one-handed PlayStation Move motion controller. Golem is a seated VR experience; you move your character around by gently leaning your torso forward and backward, left and right. ""We're calling this the incline control scheme,"" says Griesemer. ""We spent 6 months polishing it: How do you tell the difference between someone wanting to go backward, or just looking up?""

I eventually end up controlling a massive golem, but at first I'm put inside a tiny one that runs around on the protagonist's bedroom floor. The game's main character is bedridden and unable to walk, but can magically create and inhabit inanimate objects, and move about freely that way. The fictional process of making golems in the game, Grisemer says, is ""very mechanical.""

""The more hand-wavy or magical things are, the less they make themselves available to people,"" Griesemer says. ""Yes, there is magic involved obviously, but you're not summoning them out of the ground. It's much more technical.""

So now I'm micro-size on the floor. The room is a modest wooden dwelling, seemingly set out in the middle of nowhere, but full of belongings. Staring up at the low ceiling is like looking at the vaults of a cathedral. A dead beetle, taller than me, lies belly-up on the rough-hewn wooden floor.

47,Naked and Unafraid to Exercise in Virtual Reality,"I can without bashfulness say that I have logged hundreds of hours on Beat Saber as naked as the day I was born. It was neither fetish nor high-concept performance art; it grew from simple need.

In the spring of 2018, I was trying to keep a VR startup afloat, navigating a never-ending flurry of emails, Slack messages, video calls, and tweets from the confines of my efficiency in San Mateo, California. Though typically an active person, I’d deluded myself into believing that I just didn’t have the time for luxuries like the gym and “mental health.” I did, however, make a special dispensation for staying abreast of industry happenings, and ever since a video of my friend SwanVR had gone viral, I’d been itching to play Beat Saber.

Once I started, I couldn’t stop. It quickly became habit; any time I got stressed, I’d shove my chair away from my desk and fire it up—sometimes for 90 minutes or more. In a time when I was sure I didn’t have the time for fitness, I began to establish a daily routine. My story is one of many—with folks from all over the world losing as much as 138 pounds by turning titles like Audioshield, Audio Trip, BOXVR, Creed: Rise to Glory, Holopoint, OhShape, Racket: NX, Synth Riders, Soundboxing, and Thrill of the Fight into formal exercise routines.

Re: the nudity, the laundry machines in the basement were coin-operated, and I just didn’t want to deal with sopping clothes stinking up my small apartment. I’d often muse, though, how bizarre it might have looked if anybody had witnessed it: some gangly white guy strapped into a VR headset, unselfconsciously flailing around a cramped space.

Somewhat in juxtaposition to VR’s oft-touted capacities to build empathy through embodiment, my TMI anecdote points to the power of disembodiment. So much of the modern fitness experience is wrapped up in appearance, which in turn opens the doors for insecurity and shame. It’s not just when we feel embarrassed about our out-of-shape bodies—though of course many are deterred from going to the gym because of self-esteem issues—it’s a whole host of other factors. Some are social. Am I sweating too much? Am I wearing the right clothes? Am I being laughed at? Some have to do with our sense of identity. Will I look incompetent? What if I use a machine incorrectly? I used to be able to do x at y ability—how did I let myself go? Others can be even more practical, like how often we trust ourselves to actually do laundry.

Peloton, of course, has capitalized on these concerns, building a lifestyle community around its $2,300 stationary bike (plus $40 per month subscription service). The $1,500 Mirror, a literal mirror with built-in text and video overlay functionality, is seeking to expand the trend to categories like yoga, dance, boxing, and other cardio classes. It’s easy to see how private machinery addresses many of the obstacles that keep folks from hitting the gym. Where Peloton or Mirror might offer ongoing streams of new classes, though, they are fixed physical platforms; VR fitness differentiates itself in letting users step outside the existing reality paradigm. Any mix of features can be included in an immersive game environment—and that includes how bodies are represented. In Beat Saber, the only visual correlation of your body are the two sabers, which are not “in” your hands so much as they are your hands.","People may become so obsessed with the game that they forget to take care of their real-life bodies. This could lead to people becoming overweight or obese, and it could also lead to people becoming addicted to the game and neglecting their real-life responsibilities.",https://www.wired.com/story/virtual-reality-fitness-supernatural/,2020-04-30 13:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9948194622993468,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Health & Wellbeing
48,Oculus Rift Plus Motion Controls Make Shooting Almost Too Realistic,"Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

The Oculus Rift virtual reality headset display is still without a release date, but early versions have already blown us away with the device's ability to immerse wearers in virtual worlds.

But there's still a big question facing the team at Oculus: What is virtual reality input?

Right now, you can play games while wearing the Oculus headset while seated in front of your keyboard and mouse, or while holding a controller. But when your display gives you the ability to look up, down and all around you with lifelike head tracking, will we want a more immersive, realistic type of input as well?

Teddy Lipowitz, a developer from Australia, has put together a demo of the sort of thing we might play in the near future. Lipowitz, 32, posted a demo on the Oculus Rift forums of a cover-based first-person shooter that uses motion controllers.

The simplistic demo pits a single player with a gun against an battalion of alien soldiers. Physically ducking with your body lets you hide behind crates to dodge their blasts, and Lipowitz's setup allows for precise control of the gun.

The demo is so realistic, he says, that some players get a little too immersed.

""Please be careful when playing this demo,"" Lipowitz wrote on the forums. ""Lots of people try to support themselves on the crates when they try to stand up or when leaning up against a column, but find there is nothing there!""

The motion controllers aren't just for gun control; Lipowitz' demo uses them to track the movement of the player's torso. The Oculus Rift tracks your head, not your body.

The demo makes use of Razer's Hydra motion controllers, two Wii-style wands that are sold as a bundle.

By strapping one of the wands to his chest and using another as a gun, Lipowitz tracks his head, torso and arm movements. He can look around while walking in a straight line, and the Rift headset and Hydra communicate so things don't get out of sync.

""Once I had that part figured out,"" Lipowitz told WIRED in an email, ""the rest was pretty easy. 3-D games are really built for this kind of thing!""

Lipowitz says that he's tweaked things at a software level about as well as he ever could, and that new hardware will have to be developed to properly fix some of the remaining issues, like the jittery gun controls.

""Cables are the biggest problem at the moment,"" he says. ""You're limited to a pretty small play space, and if you turn around too many times you'll get tangled. I've built my levels so you're mostly facing towards your desk, which makes the layout quite linear.""

Lipowitz's demo is available for free download, and he has no plans on selling his code, saying he's just ""very excited about the reincarnation of Virtual Reality.""

While the consumer version of the Oculus Rift is not yet on shelves, the development kit version is available for $300 from Oculus, with new orders slated to ship in September.",The potential for players to become too immersed in the game and forgetting that they are in a virtual world. This could lead to players injuring themselves if they try to physically interact with their environment.,https://www.wired.com/2013/08/oculus-rift-hydra-demo/,2013-08-05 13:30:16+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9546210169792176,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
49,VR Ads Are Almost Here. Don’t Act Surprised,"Imagine, for a moment, that you’re inside a virtual reality world. You look to your left and an open door appears, beckoning you to walk through it. You enter and suddenly find yourself in the middle of an advertisement—a branded world you can explore and manipulate. Forget banner ads and auto-playing videos. The advertisement of the future is immersive, almost game like. And it's nearly here.

Last week, Unity, the world’s largest VR development company, announced Virtual Room, a new type of interactive advertisement it plans to roll out later this year. Unlike the standalone VR marketing experiences you've seen before, Virtual Room ads will surface across a wide network of VR apps, similar to the display ads you see on your laptop or the video ads you see while playing games on your phone. Don’t act surprised—you knew this was coming.

Like any new medium, VR must be monetized, says Tony Parisi head of Unity's VR and AR strategy. “Developers want to make money,” he says. “We want to help them do that.“ Until recently, though, it was unclear how, exactly, that would happen. Most VR developers make cash from micro transactions and in-app purchases, but that's pennies compared to what advertising can bring in.

Google

To capitalize on the opportunity, other VR companies have already begun exploring what ads might look like in this new medium. In a recent blog post, Google showed off a concept for a floating cube that players can tap or gaze at to start video advertisements—sort of like auto-play, but in VR. The format is simple by design. “VR ad formats should be easy for developers to implement, native to VR, flexible enough to customize, and useful and non-intrusive for users,” writes Aayush Upadhyay and Neel Rao of Google’s Area 120.

Google's vision nods to the legacy of existing digital advertisements, which many in the ad industry are trying to avoid. ""Our hope is that VR creates new opportunities that don’t replicate advertising the way that mobile originally did with repurposed 30-second TV spots,"" says Eric John, deputy director of video at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the organization responsible for setting guidelines for web, mobile, and now VR advertisements.

The IAB is working with Unity to build guidelines around Virtual Room, which outline everything from how long an ad should play to how often it should surface. For now, Unity says branded content will be opt in for both developers and players. It will surface for no more than two minutes every hour, and those ads will be highly targeted as to not alienate the person interacting with them. They’ll likely pop up at points of friction—when a player is having trouble or after a level is completed—similar to ads on mobile games and television.

What will change is how the player interacts with advertisements. People won’t passively watch Unity-created ads; they'll play with them. “Ads are usually linear,” says Julie Shumaker, VP of business development at Unity. “And there's nothing linear about VR.”","One potential downside of Virtual Room ads is that they could further fragment the already fragmented VR market. If ads only surface in certain VR apps, that could create a divide between those with ads and those without. That, in turn, could make it harder for VR developers to monetize their apps and make a profit.",https://www.wired.com/story/vr-ads-are-almost-here/,2017-07-21 11:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9947293400764464,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
50,The Wild Camera Rig That Could Finally Crack VR Filmmaking,"For all the furor surrounding virtual reality, there are some fundamental elements still very much up in the air. Foremost among those is video: specifically how, exactly, we're going to be creating 360-degree, 3D video content that's immersive enough to rival the perfectly rendered CG environments we'll be seeing in gaming---and what technology will emerge for filmmakers to use to do it. The past few years have seen a pitched race to create the perfect video-capture solution, from taped-together GoPros to arrays of linked ultra-HD Red Dragon cameras.

Now, one of early frontrunners in VR video is offering its own solution to filmmakers. (Well, some filmmakers.)

This morning, Jaunt VR officially announced Neo, which it's calling ""a series of professional-grade camera systems specifically designed for capturing fully-immersive, 360-degree cinematic VR experiences."" Similar to other announced systems like Samsung's Project Beyond, the Neo is a rig of multiple high-resolution cameras inside a unified housing.

Jaunt's been working on the system since its inception in 2013, and producing content since last year; the Neo represents the fifth iteration of what they now consider a workable solution. (Disclosure: Conde Nast Publications, which owns WIRED, is one of Jaunt's content partners.) While its componentry has improved, and a new centralized monitoring system helps diagnose shot-scrapping failures, Jaunt co-founder and CTO Arthur van Hoff credits two very specific things for the Neo's market-readiness: large sensors and global shutter synchronization.

The former is due to VR's need for natural lighting (it's nearly impossible to capture 360 degrees of indoor space without exposing traditional lighting apparatus); the latter is to defeat one of VR video's bugaboos. ""If the camera moves, or there's fast action as with sports,"" says van Hoff, ""and the cameras aren't perfectly in sync, you'll have motion artifacts."" Global shutter allows filmmakers to ensure that the footage they gather is optimally aligned, which helps prevent visible stitching in the resulting panoramic image.

The official announcement is unsurprisingly light on performance specs, though van Hoff claims that each of the more than 16 lenses (they're not yet saying exactly how many) is capable of delivering 8K resolution per eye---not that that matters in the forthcoming first crop of consumer VR devices, the displays of which won't feature resolution much higher than 2.5K.

The Neo range will consist of two models: one for indoor events like sports, then other for very-high-resolution outdoor shoots. They'll become available to Jaunt's content partners in August. As for pricing? According to van Hoff, it's ""irrelevant""---it likely won't be available to consumers, and Jaunt will be leasing or renting the systems. Beyond that, there's a bit of professional secrecy; ""we don't really want to reveal how much it costs us to build,"" van Hoff says, beyond the fact that it's less than an array of RED cameras.

For all his hedging, however, van Hoff does readily cop to one thing. ""This is not the last camera that we're building,"" he says. ""I'm absolutely sure of that.""","Potential for motion artifacts in VR video due to the lack of global shutter synchronization in current camera systems. This could lead to visible stitching in panoramic images, which could be a major problem for filmmakers.",https://www.wired.com/2015/06/jaunt-vr-neo-camera/,2015-06-30 13:00:33+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9957321286201476,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
51,Why NASA Wants Microsoft’s HoloLens in Space,"NASA hopes to use HoloLens aboard the space station to allow astronauts to work with a remote expert who can see what the astronaut sees and help with unfamiliar tasks. The device might also act as an augmented-reality instruction manual that, say, uses 3-D images to show an astronaut where to place some equipment or what handle to turn. (Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said in an interview that HoloLens will be available to developers within the next year; the timing of a consumer release is still unknown.)

In late July and early August, NASA astronauts tried using HoloLens to help with several tasks at the Aquarius Reef Base.

Norris, who is also the leader of the Ops Lab at JPL, says NASA is also working on other applications for HoloLens, like using augmented reality for inventory management. Apparently keeping track of where things are and how to find them is a big challenge on the space station, even though objects have bar codes on them and are organized with a database. NASA has prototyped an app that can be used to recognize an object and show the HoloLens wearer a path to follow that leads to where the object should be stored, Norris says.

In the meantime, to get some sense of what it will be like to use HoloLens on the space station, NASA experimented with HoloLens at the Aquarius underwater research station off the coast of Key Largo, Florida, in late July and early August. Astronauts used the device for tasks like checking emergency breathing equipment by going through a series of steps ranging from turning valves to finding and plugging in equipment, and setting up equipment to support an undersea robot.

In both cases, an expert sitting in a remote control center on dry land helped by using a Skype program Microsoft built for HoloLens (see “Reality Check: Comparing HoloLens and Magic Leap”) in which a forward-facing camera on the HoloLens let the expert see what the astronaut saw. If needed, the remote expert could draw in midair to point out things that the astronauts would see with the HoloLens headset (the whole time, the astronauts could also see a floating video of the expert in front of their faces). Norris thinks the task would have taken “many times as long” if it had simply been spelled out as a procedure to follow.

Though he thinks it can be helpful, Norris also says there are “enormous challenges” associated with building augmented-reality applications, such as figuring out how an application menu should look and how the user should interact with it when it’s not shown on a laptop or smartphone screen.

“The rules are different when you’re now rendering information all around a person,” he says.","The potential for people to become addicted to the technology. While there are many potential benefits to using virtual reality, such as helping astronauts complete tasks more efficiently, there is also the potential for people to become so engrossed in the virtual world that they lose touch with reality.

52,"Hey Surgeon, Is That a HoloLens on Your Head?","Imagine maneuvering your car through a dark tunnel that bulges unexpectedly in places and then turns sharply through a maze-like passage. The perilous journey feels safer with a light and camera showing the way ahead. It’s even better if digital lines lay out a track, assuring you stay in your lane.

In a rudimentary way, that scenario illustrates the advantage mixed reality (or augmented reality) is bringing to surgery, starting with the delicate pathways of the sinus. “When you’re doing minimally invasive surgery in a narrow corridor, you want to stay in the corridor, do whatever needs to be done, and not disturb anything around you,” says Martin J. Citardi, a rhinologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, who in 2018 became the first in the United States to perform sinus surgery using a blended view of real and digital imagery.

Digital markings superimposed on real-world camera feeds have become commonplace in everyday life, as in the rear-view cameras on cars and the first-down lines in televised football games, but it’s a new phenomenon in surgery. In 2017, the guidance system Citardi used became the first to gain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for sinus surgery. Two different surgical planning apps designed for HoloLens, Microsoft’s mixed reality headset, have since also garnered FDA approval. Coming soon are the shimmering holograms of sci-fi imagination in surgery itself: A clinical trial is now evaluating whether HoloLens headsets help surgeons and radiologists zap tumors.

These emerging tools are “a dramatic step forward,” says Jenny Chen, a neuroradiologist and founder of 3D Heals, which promotes innovation in medical 3D printing. “The next step is to see how companies fine-tune these products to be more user-friendly and clinically more effective.”

The HoloLens headset, whose second iteration is due for release by the end of the year, is finding a niche among surgeons and biomedical engineers. “When you put on the HoloLens, it’s like having X-ray vision,” says Karl West, an inventor and biomedical engineer at The Cleveland Clinic who developed a HoloLens app that is licensed to the Cleveland-based startup MediView. “You can see the anatomy inside the patient.” There are no actual X-rays; the images come from pre-operative CT scans or MRIs, projected holographically through a head-mounted display and coupled with ultrasound and electromagnetic tracking devices.","One potential unintended consequence of virtual reality in surgery is that it could create a false sense of security for surgeons. If surgeons rely too heavily on virtual reality, they may not be prepared for unexpected complications that can occur during surgery. Additionally, if something goes wrong with the virtual reality system during surgery, it could have disastrous consequences.",https://www.wired.com/story/hey-surgeon-is-that-a-hololens-on-your-head/,2019-11-21 12:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9852786064147948,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
53,VR Is Back in Pop Culture—As a Warning,"Virtual reality has never been a subtle technology—and the same goes for its treatment in popular culture.

When VR jumped its sci-fi firewall to sweep through Hollywood in the 1990s, it was a thing of maximalist, fantastic promise: brushed steel headsets and space-age gloves on the outside, swirly colors and stylized hacker dreams on the inside. Think Keanu Reeves playing virtual cat-and-mouse with the yakuza in Johnny Mnemonic, or Michael Douglas pulling off corporate espionage in the world's most grandiose database in the wow-did-that-age-terribly, quasi-erotic thriller Disclosure.

After a time, VR even showed up on four-quadrant TV like Murder She Wrote and Mad About You, a perfect symbol of fantasy and the future. Eventually, though, the future proved to be so far away that the fantasy withered, and VR took its place alongside Pogs and gratuitously transparent beverages as a craze that was doomed never to see the next millennium. Except that's not exactly what happened. VR staged a comeback, becoming something that people could actually do, not just dream about—and something that lived again in pitch meetings and development pipelines.

So now, more than 20 years later, VR is coming back to screens. It's still a symbol of the future, and it's still the realm of fantasy. But in two new shows, VR's treatment suggests that society may not have the same appetite for those things as it once did.

Kiss Me First, which hits Netflix today after a run on British television earlier this year, started its life as a YA novel, albeit one that had nothing to do with VR. Leila (Tallulah Haddon), a young woman whose mother has just died, spends much of her time fighting with friends in Azana, an large-scale VR game where she's known as ""Shadowfax."" Soon, beckoned by another player named Mania (Simona Brown), she stumbles upon a world inside the world; Mania's friend Adrian (Matthew Beard) has hacked Azana to carve out a hidden paradise. The angsty misfits who congregate there call it ""Red Pill,"" a Matrix reference that might be resonant if grosser corners of the internet hadn't already tainted it.

Not only has Adrian cobbled together neckbands that allow Red Pillers to feel physical pain in VR, but Leila suspects that he's using his charisma—which seems to revolve around a preternaturally velvety voice and tucked-in sweaters—to seduce them into making perilous real-life decisions. As she navigates a lurching friendship with Mania in the real-world, where she's actually named Tess, Leila has to validate her suspicions and find a way to put an end to Adrian's psychological puppeteering.","It can be used to manipulate people's emotions and thoughts.

54,"""Problematic Wi-Fi Access"": Apple Bans Augmented Reality App Sekai Camera [Update]","More and more apps are stricken from the App Store as of late, for a variety of reasons. Today, the Apple hammer hit Tokyo-based Tonchidot whose augmented reality app Sekai Camera was removed without warning.

The free app, which made its – memorable – debut during TechCrunch 50 in 2008, intends to help users “tag the world” by imposing information (text, pictures, video and audio) over images in the iPhone camera.

Sekai Camera uses GPS to locate the user and measure the distance to objects in the vicinity. The problem for Apple: in places with weak GPS signals (i.e. within buildings or underground), the app relies on PlaceEngine, a technology that makes it possible to determine a user’s location via Wi-Fi. Once it’s installed on a device, the PlaceEngine client collects Wi-Fi signals from nearby access points and sends the information to a server, which then estimates your location.

PlaceEngine provider Koozyt says on its Japanese website Apple changed their policy regarding “the way apps access Wi-Fi devices”. Not only Sekai Camera, but a number of other PlaceEngine-powered apps were kicked out, too (including Yahoo! Maps for the iPhone). Details are still unclear at this point, with Koozyt saying they are currently looking into the issue.

More information on the peculiar ban are available at The Register.

Tonchidot itself cites “issues regarding the App Store review process” as a reason for the ban of Sekai Camera version 2.1.1, adding the app will make a comeback in version 2.2 “soon”. I wouldn’t be too surprised to see PlaceEngine get scrapped altogether.

In Japan, Sekai Camera is the most downloaded iPhone app to date, and it was elected “Best App in 2009″ by Apple Japan late last year (it was released worldwide in December).

We reached out to Tonchidot for a comment and will update this post when we have it.

Update with Tonchidot’s response (edited):

We have also received sympathetic words from many people across the

world, and really appreciate everyone’s support.

We always strive to comply with Apple’s policies, and will fix and

resubmit a version that satisfies their current requirements. We do

not know what the exact reason is for their recent decision, but

Koozyt, among others, have been extremely helpful in helping us

identify the potential cause.

No worries, will will have a new and better version back up on App

Store very soon, so please look forward to it ! :)

VR,"After spending years as an editor and co-producer on the Paranormal Activity films, Gregory Plotkin finally stepped into the director's chair for Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension. But now that he's done, he's found another kind of footage he wants to use: virtual reality.

""I really want to open this up, just like I did with found footage. If found footage just stays in horror, it's going to peter out,"" Plotkin says. ""I feel like it's dying a little bit right now, but it will come back when people reinvent it with other genres. I think the same thing with VR.""

So what's he looking to do? Maybe some horror, yes. But also a sports drama. (He was associate editor on the Friday Night Lights movie.) Maybe some ""experimental short-form"" thing. Definitely a sci-fi adventure experience. ""Something like Avatar,"" he says. But reinventing VR in new genres is a lofty goal, even if Plotkin is willing to try a lot of things to hit it. Here's the director's Do's and Don'ts for how he wants to change the game.

Do Screw Up

Like with any new storytelling technology, people learning how to use VR are going to fail. That's good for the medium. ""I'm equally as excited about the mistakes—about the things that don't work—as about the things that do work,"" Plotkin says. ""There may be things where I think 'If I move the camera here and tell it this way, it's going to look great.' But then you can get the serendipitous shot that's like 'Hey, I never thought that this could happen,' and boom! It's going to influence how I tell the story.""

Don't Hold the Audience's Hand

One of the big challenges with VR right now is, essentially, teaching people how to use it. Some folks enter an experience and don't know they can look/move around. Some folks feel like they can't move enough. Plotkin thinks it's imperative we let people find their own way. ""I don't want to guide the audience too much, I want them to really explore and find the space themselves,"" he says. ""But I think with a little bit of movement it will really force them to be proactive and explore the space.""

Do Make VR Funnier

So far, VR has done animation, action, documentary, a little bit of sci-fi, and even some music. It's been harder, however, to find ways to make VR funny. He may not be the one to do it, but Plotkin would like to see more LOLs in the goggles. ""I think comedy is the one I haven't seen,"" he says. ""Yet, I don't know that I have an answer for how to do comedy in a virtual reality space.""

Don't Stick to What You Know

As someone who got his first big directing gig with a Paranormal Activity flick, you might think Plotkin would stay in his lane. But he thinks it's important for directors to work in as many genres as possible to find out what really works in VR. ""Horror has been the most open door right now, so it's something I can handle really well on a storytelling level,"" he says. ""But I do want to take it in other directions.""

Do Bring in the Big Guns

Right now, the biggest hurdle is getting people to try VR. The bigger the names attached to the medium, the better it will do. ""It's just getting people to look at it,"" Plotkin says. ""You get a camera in the hands of a [Martin] Scorsese or a [Steven Spielberg] or a David Fincher or whomever to put their stamp on something, I think that's what VR needs right now. It needs that catalyst and then you're going to have the floodgates open and people are going to be jazzed about it.""",People may become too reliant on it and it may eventually take over their lives.,https://www.wired.com/2015/10/paranormal-activity-director-virtual-reality/,2015-10-26 11:00:52+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9930063486099244,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
56,Insenth Focuses AR Glasses On Cyclists,"It’s clear that the first version of Google Glass had an identity crisis — unless you count the Scoble shower incident. But let’s just call that a crisis… One problem with the wearable was there was no clear consumer proposition, so no reason for the public to want to sport the smart specs.

Google is apparently reworking Glass now, likely with a narrower, enterprise focus. And that makes a lot more sense. The traction that Glass had gained was for niche industrial use-cases. Mountain View is not the only company thinking this way either — Sony is also building smart specs with an enterprise bent.

So while VR headsets like Facebook’s Oculus Rift take aim at the gaming market, dangling the prospect of immersive entertainment (assuming you’re able to forget what a dork you look like IRL), makers of augmented reality specs are going after more specific and specialized niche use-cases.

To wit: meet Senth In1 — a pair of AR glasses, based on Android 4.3, being developed by a Beijing-based startup, specifically for cyclists. The team is currently raising crowdfunds via the Indiegogo platform with the aim of turning their prototype into a shipping product. At the time of writing they’re 85 per cent funded, with just over $34,000 pledged.

The glasses are being designed to work in conjunction with a thumb controller which is mounted on the bike’s handlebars, enabling the wearer to control a ring-based UI that allows them to choose different functions by swiping around a circle and pressing to select. The specs will also support other interaction methods, including a lateral touchpad on the side of the glasses, voice control and motion-sensing head movements for UI selections.

In terms of features the team is aiming to develop for their Insenth OS (atop the Android base), users will apparently be able to view their distance and speed via the glasses’ waveguide display, as well as link the hardware via Bluetooth to other sensing wearables they own to view other metrics such as heart rate or cadence; plus view maps and navigation directions as they ride; take photos and videos via an onboard camera; select and play music; and make phone calls and send voice messages.

The prototype is actually the fourth developed by the team, according to co-founder Li Jiwen, the other three being professional AR glasses. But with limited funds to support ongoing R&D — the team has apparently been working on AR glasses since 2012 — he says he made the decision to narrow the focus to try developing smart specs for cycling, which was also a personal interest.

The advantage of this sort of focus is of course having an established community to tailor the tech for and market the product to, rather than attempting to sell a vague general promise of AR’s benefits. Add to that, cyclists are already used to kitting themselves out in specialist gear — and their kit isn’t what the mainstream would recognize as fashionable, so there’s less likely to be any stigma associated with wearing a face computer out and about.

If the team meets its crowdfunding target, it says it’s aiming to get the Insenth In1 smart specs to market starting from this December — albeit that’s a pretty ambitious timeframe for such a complex product (and where hardware crowdfunders are concerned it’s always wise to expect delays).

Insenth’s glasses are being priced at $250 to Indiegogo early birds, undercutting the price of Recon Jet‘s rival smart specs which are also focused on the extreme sports space.","It may lead to people becoming more isolated from real life social interactions. This is because people may become so engrossed in the virtual world that they forget to interact with people in the real world.

57,Google Cardboard's New York Times Experiment Just Hooked a Generation on VR,"Yesterday my Facebook feed filled up with pictures of friends' kids clutching cardboard boxes to their faces. Well, I should say, Cardboard boxes.

That's because subscribers to The New York Times' Sunday print edition received a Google Cardboard virtual reality headset, wrapped in the standard-issue blue plastic bag, as part of the Times' rollout of its own VR content.

Cardboard isn't much to look at. It's a bit of corrugated, yes, cardboard and some velcro that you fold to create a slot for your smartphone and a pair of flaps to block your peripheral vision. Inside is the crucial component, the pair of cheap plastic lenses that that transform the flat, doubled-up images on your phone's screen into the illusion of an immersive 3-D environment.

Kids who've had the VR experience have a new set of expectations of what it should mean to interact with a computer.

But Cardboard's crudeness is also its genius. It's cheap enough to be handed out for free; we smartphone users supply the only part that's expensive. The Times and Google could afford to drop about 1.3 million of them in the newspaper. That's 1.3 million people who said to themselves yesterday, ""Wait, you mean this VR thing is something I can have right here, right now, too?""

Okay, I'm sure that among Times subscribers, several were savvy enough to already have some kind of VR rig on hand and have been probing the virtual depths for a while now. But embarrassing confession time: I'm an editor at WIRED—you know, where we cover the future—and it just hadn't sunk in that VR was something I could do, too. Yes, a bit of that was brand blindness; Samsung has been pushing its own Gear headset for a while, but no highly visible headset targeting iOS users has emerged yet. In fact, when I asked our Gear team what I could use to watch VR on an iPhone, the response was, ""It's basically just Cardboard.""

Whatever the reason for my myopia, it was awfully convenient that, just a few days after I started idly searching Cardboard options on Amazon, one showed up in my driveway. I suspect that, like many of those other 1.3 million, the first thing I did was to put it on my kid. And I'm pretty sure that means everything.

New Is Normal

If you're my age, the first thing I bet you thought when you heard VR was making a comeback was, ""Wait, didn't they try that in the '90s?"" Then you experience today's version, and you discover that VR's current incarnation is not what you experienced at that cyber café back when we were still calling things ""cyber.""

If you're a kid, on the other hand, there's a good chance you've grown up assuming that portable touchscreen portals to a significant portion of human knowledge, entertainment, and communication are a given. Yes, you think your dad's iPhone is pretty cool. But then yesterday you put on Google Cardboard and watched a train come hurtling toward you before you flew up into the sky and into the embrace of a giant baby. And you said, ""Yeah, now we're talking.""

I don't know what the exact year is, but I believe that up to a certain age, any technology a kid encounters registers as ""normal."" To me, a world without color TV or personal computers is an abstraction. For a host of kids as of yesterday, so is a world without VR.

This is why distributing something as unpolished as Google Cardboard in a way that's as gimmicky (and anachronistic) as handing it out with a newspaper turns out to be such a big deal. Sure, we're talking about a tiny subset of kids. But they'll tell their friends. Their parents are already telling their friends. And a technology that once seemed remote is suddenly accessible.

And in the case of this particular technology, accessibility translates almost immediately into visceral intimacy. Experiencing VR for the first time isn't just cool; it's revelatory. This is why so many of us made sure to capture the moment of our kids' first encounter. Most parents, I hope, don't make videos of their kids' reactions when we unbox our latest iPhones. But I believe we had a collective sense that our kids were experiencing something meaningfully new—not just an encounter with a new technology, but with a new way of relating to technology.

Especially as a medium for non-fiction, I believe the hype that VR can act as a powerful empathy engine, a uniquely direct way to put us in someone else's world. This makes me hopeful that VR will become much more than the next level of escapism for an already screen-addled generation. I know that's some serious parental wishful thinking. But for good or ill, Google Cardboard is just good enough to imprint a new paradigm on a nation of 8-year-olds. From now on, kids who've had the VR experience have a new set of expectations of what it should mean to interact with a computer. Imagine what they'll expect by the time they're 18.","The main unintended consequence of virtual reality discussed in the article is that it may lead to a generation of kids who are even more addicted to screens than their parents. While VR can be used for educational and empathetic purposes, it's also a very powerful tool for escapism. If kids grow up using VR as a way to escape from the real world, they may have a hard time adjusting to reality as adults.",https://www.wired.com/2015/11/google-cardboards-new-york-times-experiment-just-hooked-a-generation-on-vr/,2015-11-09 22:32:41+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9958951473236084,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
58,A Google mixed reality experiment puts a fake face on top of your ...,"Mixed reality videos — where a video camera and a green screen are used to show what a person using VR is experiencing — aren’t particularly new. But a recent collaboration between Google’s Daydream and Research teams has come up with a new spin on mixed reality by making the VR headsets transparent so you can actually “see” the user’s face.

Of course, Google hasn’t actually invented a way to magically X-ray through a VR headset. Rather, using a combination of a 3D scanned model of a person’s face, along with an HTC Vive headset modified with eye tracking technology allows for a digital recreation of the person’s face to be substituted in place. To prevent a disconcerting uncanny valley effect, a translucent version of the headset is left in place, to create some mental distance for a viewer.

The Google Research blog dives deeper into how the system works. Each 3D scan typically takes less than a minute and creates a database of eye gazes and blinks, which the software then maps to the data from the eye tracking system in the headset. Additionally, the software color corrects the digitally created face portion to match the lighting of the rest of the user’s face.

For now, the transparent headset effect remains a cool research project, with no formal release information for either developers or consumers. But Google is apparently “exploring how to bring this technology to select creators in the future,” so it’s possible we could see the tech show up somewhere down the line.","The potential for users to become disoriented and/or nauseous.

The eKurzinfo app recognizes over 300 different elements around the A3, and displays pop-ups with short, simple explanations of what things are, what they do, and how to service them. The app uses both 2-D and 3-D tracking technology to understand what the owner is looking at, and since eKurzinfo is linked with Metaio's cloud-connected infrastructure, there's no need to update the app – new information or user-requested features can be pushed directly to the device.

60,An Arty Oculus Trip Through the Large Hadron Collider,"The Large Hadron Collider has brought new insights into the creation of our universe, some bizarrely compelling conspiracy theories, and now an interactive experience powered by Oculus Rift and Leap Motion. Collider is an arty audiovisual experience that provides a first-person perspective of a particle hurtling through the $6.4 billion apparatus.

Once you don an Oculus Rift headset outfitted with a Leap Motion detector, you are immediately sent spinning through the collider's synchrotron ring. Aside from the name, there's no attempt to replicate the atom smashing experience scientifically. Instead, human hands are replaced with kinematic rigging bones, like something from a Dire Straits video, while subtle motions made by the user remake the virtual world with kaleidoscope of generative graphics and pulsing music.

Designer Eddie Lee has taken artistic license with Collider, but wants it to be a serious homage to the search for the ""God Particle."" ""When the images of the LHC first surfaced online years ago, I was so moved by its sheer beauty---the immense scale, the perfect symmetry, the deep vanishing lines, the architectural and engineering triumph,"" he says. ""The fact that something, built for science, was so beautiful and majestic---it truly struck a chord in me.""

Inspiration for the project came from science, but the aesthetic layer is a fascinating array of choices and influences. Scientific-looking reticules, DayGlo color palettes and low-poly graphics from the Saved by the Bell era, and 1960s psychedelia like the Eye of Providence come together in a dynamic cyberpunk landscape. Seminal art games like Rez and Electroplankton also helped shape the look, while the soundtrack, by Japanese DJ Tomohisa Kuramitsu, widely known as Baiyon, fills out the experience.

The Wild West of UX

Underneath the trippy, exuberant surface of Collider lies a serious user interface design project. Lee followed the ""rail shooter"" design pattern, where a player is forced along a path and can only change his view point, but the absence of a traditional game controller or keyboard forced Lee to make inventive interaction design choices. ""3-D is a wild west of UX design. This is extremely exciting because we, as developers, have the ability to define how the user engages with this brand-new interface paradigm,"" he says. ""On the flip side, having this brand new interface paradigm is extremely frightening because there is nothing to fallback on. For example, there is no 'double-click' equivalent in the space of motion controls."" Instead, Lee looked to common human behaviors like ""pinch and pull"" gestures and claps due to their commonly understood meanings, cross-cultural applicability, and their ability to be detected by the Leap Motion detector.

Collider doesn't promise a scientifically accurate experience, but does demonstrate the potential of immersive virtual reality. Funktronic Labs

Collider can be experienced without a VR headset. Users simply wave their hands over the Leap Motion detector and see the results projected on a screen. ""We wanted the player to feel a sense of 'play,' as if he or she was jamming to music and was in total control of how the music and visuals progressed,"" says Lee, though he's not sure the experience would scale to a club level. ""How can you guarantee that someone, who has zero musical talent or inclination, will use the product to produce music that is pleasing to the crowd? "" For all its achievements, Collider can't yet turn the spastic gyrations of Mollied-out club goers into something productive.

Collider, created by game studio Funktronic Labs, is the closest communion you can make to the sublime without indulging in psychotropic substances. You can get it free through the Leap Motion app store.","It may lead to people becoming more isolated from each other.

The device remains a bit abstract, of course, since that’s all that’s been shared at this point–an abstract–but folks at Siggraph should know a good deal more next week.

Mann has a personal interest in this sort of work, and has for some time. As TechCrunch and others have reported, Mann wears a device called an EyeTap, a small camera and computer he has attached directly to his skull. He’s basically decades ahead of Google’s vision of Google Glass, and has himself been a cyborg of sorts for 34 years, when he first started wearing such a system. (For more on that tech, see the EyeTap site.) Mann has written that he believes that such “Digital Eye Glass” will one day replace ordinary glasses for everyone. But last June, it became evident that people at a certain French McDonald’s did not agree–Mann alleges that he was assaulted at a Parisian branch of the fast food chain due to his unusual eyewear.

Here’s a great video introduction of Mann and his work.","Virtual reality has been touted as a way to transport people to different worlds and experiences. However, one of the unintended consequences of virtual reality is that it can be used to create incredibly realistic and lifelike simulations of real-world situations.

62,"Star Wars Dips Into Virtual Reality With ""Jakku Spy,"" Created In Parallel With The Force Awakens","The Star Wars marketing blitz is on, with everything from trailers hitting the Internet to cans of food donning the likeness of characters at the supermarket.

People are flat out excited to see this new installment, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, on December 18th. To feed that excitement, the official Star Wars app (iOS / Android or search for “star wars official” on either store) has gotten a Google Cardboard-powered virtual reality experience called “Jakku Spy.” It was developed by Lucasfilm’s ILMxLAB studio along with Google and Verizon.

The premise is this: you’re on the desert world, Jakku, and you’re a Resistance secret agent. You’re in 360-degree immersive virtual reality and you experience the story in a series. New vignettes are available every few days. Naturally, the story will feed your appetite until the movie comes out on the 18th.

If you head over to a Verizon store today (and are a customer!), you can pick up a Star Wars-themed Google Cardboard to experience it yourself. It comes in BB-8, Kylo Ren, First Order stormtrooper, and R2-D2 flavors.

Lucasfilm’s head of New Media/VP, Advanced Development Group, Rob Bredow said this about “Jakku Spy”:

ILMxLAB’s whole foundation and mission is about creating immersive entertainment, and that includes virtual reality. We think a lot of people are going to get to experience virtual reality in Google Cardboard for the first time with Jakku Spy. It’s a great opportunity because there’s this familiar content — characters and vehicles that you’ve seen in trailers — but you’re seeing it in a completely new way.

That “new way” includes activity happening all around you. Sounds. Noises. The Lucasfilm group wanted you to feel like you had walked right into the next episode of Star Wars.

“When we pitched this idea, it was really about, ‘Can we not only tell people a story that’s legitimately connected to the film, but can we also make them feel like they’re in Star Wars?'” Bredow said.

Make sure that your Wi-Fi connection is strong, because downloading each “episode” will take a bit, as they’re pretty big files.

[gallery ids=""1245868,1245869,1245867""]

I won’t ruin it for you, but a certain droid delivers a message to you.

Since the ILMxLAB worked with everyone who was involved with Star Wars, I’m assured that hardcore fans won’t be disappointed by the experience. “We’re actually working on them with the exact same people who are making the movie at the same time,” Bredow said of the VR-creation.

Star Wars in “first person” is something I’ve waited my entire life to try out…with the Disney ride the closest that I’ve ever gotten. Since “Jakku Spy” was created in concert with J.J. Abrams, checking it out is a no-brainer. For Google and Verizon, the tie-ins are a pretty genius way to get people to come into a physical store and take something with them that will change the way they think about seeing one of the most popular movie franchises of all time.

I hope that Lucasfilm’s ILMxLAB keeps playing around with VR as a platform. Can you imagine a future Star Wars being released in fully immersive 360 degree virtual reality? I could totally see it happening. Right now we’re in a hyper-hype phase of VR.

Every marketing person is wondering how to take a bite out of it for an extra eyeball or two, and brands are salivating at getting even 30 seconds of immersive content. Virtual reality is nothing new, so the industry and medium will indeed weather this storm of noise and come out on the other side more relevant and better for consumers.","Virtual reality technology is becoming more and more realistic, and as a result, people are becoming more and more obsessed with it.

63,Behold: Fighter-Jet Augmented Reality for Your Motorcycle Commute,"Google Glass has the potential to revolutionize how we get information on the move, but a team of Russian motorcyclists-slash-engineers are going one step further with an augmented reality GPS system built directly into a bike helmet.

Based in Moscow, the LiveMap crew got fed up with paper maps and unintuitive touch-screen navigation systems, so they looked to the world of fighter jets for a solution.

The result is a full-color, translucent image projected onto a helmet's visor running a version of Android and controlled through voice commands.

Instead of a Google Glass-like setup where the rider would have to look up and to the right to see the next waypoint or turn, the LiveMap system displays everything directly in the middle of the rider's point-of-view. That might sound dangerous at first, but it's execution is similar to what you'd find in the latest BMW sports sedans, and with an ambient light sensor, the system can adjust the brightness and contrast to suit the environment.

Image: LiveMap

Even more impressive is the integration of a gyroscope and digital compass, so when the rider turns his head – say, to check a blind spot – the image changes orientation to acclimate to the movement.

Voice controls and point of interest searches will supposedly be provided by Nuance, the top-shelf company that helps Siri understand commands, while mapping software will come from the folks at Navteq.

A pair of 3,000 mAh lithium-ion batteries claim to provide enough juice for a day-long ride and charge up using a standard USB plug. And while LiveMap admits that the helmet will be slightly larger than a standard brain pan, they're using a carbon fiber shell with injection-molded foam to keep weight in check. All in, the helmet should come in around 2.5 pounds, and will meet all the major crash certifications around the world (DOT, ECE 22.05 and Japan's JIS T 8133) when it goes on sale in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia in 2014, while Europe and Japan have to wait an additional year to take delivery.

Currently, LiveMap has developed the helmet, software, optics and board with funding from a range of Russian government sources, but it doesn't have a fully-functional prototype yet. So the team is turning to Indiegogo to raise $150,000, with backers coughing up $1,500 a pop to get their hands on the first round of helmets. After that, LiveMaps says the price will go up to $2,000 each – a seriously steep sticker for something most bike experts suggest you replace every five years.

Considering how much we love our current helmet, we'd be much more inclined to plunk down the coin for a retrofitted system, but considering the lack of intuitive navigation options on the market, we could be swayed.","It could lead to more accidents.

Rather than rapping knuckles carefully across the wall, listening for a vague auditory confirmation that something solid lies behind, you could simply look through the wall and actually see where your target lies. No more guess work. No more errant holes, or collapsing bookcases. Victory with every swing of the hammer.



That’s an oversimplified version of what L.A.-based startup DAQRI has engineered into its “Smart Helmet,” which looks like something a motorcycle cop from the future might wear, but is designed for a variety of industrial settings. Inserted in the helmet’s shiny, white shell is a subtly mirrored visor packed with sensors that act as a heads-up display for the wearer.

The DAQRI crew refer to their tech as “professional-grade augmented reality.” Which makes sense if you compare it to the critter-hunting AR mobile game you may have indulged in last year. When you strap on the hardware, fire up the display in the helmet, it isn’t fanciful creatures that appear.

65,That Whole Oculus Lawsuit Hinges on What Makes Code ‘New',"What exactly does it mean to steal code? That's a question at the heart of video game company ZeniMax's $2 billion lawsuit against Facebook—a suit serious enough that Mark Zuckerberg himself took the stand this week in his company's defense.

The case revolves around Facebook's $2 billion acquisition of virtual reality company Oculus in 2014. ZeniMax claims that Oculus CTO John Carmack, best known as the creator of the video game Doom, developed core parts of the Oculus Rift while employed at ZeniMax. Now ZeniMax tech is powering Facebook-owned Oculus' products without permission, the plaintiffs say. Carmack, meanwhile, asserts that Oculus founder Palmer Luckey is the true creator of the Rift and that none of his ZeniMax work found its way into the final product. To decide who's right, jurors will have to parse a question that's at least as philosophical as it is technical.

""It's an issue that goes back to some of the earliest code-copyrightability cases, when software still arrived as code in printed binders,"" says Fred Jennings, a technology and intellectual property lawyer at Tor Ekeland, PC.

As a program grows in size and complexity, the number of ways to express an idea in code also grows.

Oculus claims that its products contain not one line of ZeniMax code. But software doesn't need to copy code line for line in order to violate intellectual property law. In patent cases, for example, the code doesn't even need to be similar. But ZeniMax isn't claiming that Oculus infringed its patents---it's claiming that the company infringed its copyrights. Still, Jennings says it's possible to violate software copyrights without using the exact code found in the original program.

The issue is a thorny one. In some cases, it's not unreasonable to assume that two programmers will write remarkably similar code to solve the same problem. After all, even though many programming languages provide multiple ways to accomplish a particular task, there is still a limited number of different possible ways to express an idea with code. There is an even smaller number of ways to accomplish those tasks efficiently. But as a program grows in size and complexity, the number of ways to express an idea in code also grows, creating opportunities for a programmer to essentially ""paraphrase"" ideas taken from another programmer's work without actually doing anything substantially original.

Parsing Innovation

Despite the complexity of the issue, courts have a well established procedure for determining the similarities between two bodies of code. The Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test goes back 25 years to the decisive Computer Associates Int. Inc. v. Altai Inc. case of 1992.

The first stage of the test differentiates between the idea of a piece of software and the expression of that software. For example, the idea behind a particular piece of software might be tracking the position of your head based on data from an accelerometer embedded in a pair of VR goggles. The expression would be the code itself that address that idea.

The second step is to filter out the parts of the code that aren't subject to copyright. That includes chunks of code that are too universal to be copyrighted and code in the public domain.

Then the court compares what's left. But remember, even here the remaining code doesn't have to be copied line for line. For example, a court decided that Google had illegally copied portions of Oracle's Java programming language in the creation of the Android operating system, even though Google wrote all of its own code from scratch.

Many other factors are at play here. For example, if ZeniMax can prove that Carmack worked on Oculus software while still employed at ZeniMax, that could mean that ZeniMax owns that work, even if it is substantially different from code previously owned by ZeniMax. And much more about the case remains hidden from public prying. ""As is common in cases involving trade secrets claims, many docket entries in the ZeniMax case are sealed, so outside parties aren't able to see them,"" Jennings says. ""It's very hard to say, without guessing, what details those filings might contain, and how they might bear on the copyright issues.""

Jurors won't have to guess. But they will have to think very hard about what innovation and originality mean at a time when copying a billion-dollar idea is as simple as cut-and-paste.","It may lead to people becoming more antisocial. This is because people may start to spend more time in virtual reality than they do in real life, which could lead to them becoming less interested in interacting with other people.

66,Darpa Turns Oculus Into a Weapon for Cyberwar,"For the last two years, Darpa has been working to make waging cyberwar as easy as playing a video game. Now, like so many other games, it's about to get a lot more in-your-face.

At the Pentagon Wednesday, the armed forces' far-out research branch known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency showed off its latest demos for Plan X, a long-gestating software platform designed to unify digital attack and defense tools into a single, easy-to-use interface for American military hackers. And for the last few months, that program has had a new toy: The agency is experimenting with using the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset to give cyberwarriors a new way to visualize three-dimensional network simulations--in some cases with the goal of better targeting them for attack.

""You’re not in a two-dimensional view, so you can look around the data. You look to your left, look to your right, and see different subnets of information,"" Darpa's Plan X program manager Frank Pound told WIRED in an interview. ""With the Oculus you have that immersive environment. It's like you’re swimming in the internet.""

In its demo setup, complete with two motion-sensing Razer Hydra controllers for navigation, the user does more than swim. As captured in the video below showing an Oculus user's view, Darpa's proof-of-concept begins with a collection of ""missions"" to choose from, each of which is represented by a spherical network of computers. Select one, and you're presented with a planned series of actions to carry out--like scanning a certain network or probing target endpoints for vulnerabilities--and a collection of tools to use, represented by different abstract icons. Then you're thrown into the network to carry out the mission, while the enemy launches attacks like distributed-denial-of-service bombardments back at the user.

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

If all of that seems more than a little contrived, Pound admits that the Oculus demo is only a ""notional"" proof-of-concept, created by the San Francisco design firm Frog Design and the Austin-based simulation software company Intific. But Darpa is serious about integrating the virtual-reality headset into its plans; It's already shown the Oculus to Congress and to the Pentagon's Joint Chief of Staffs in private demonstrations, and will be experimenting further with the second developer version of the device set to be released later this summer.

If Plan X's Oculus software ever reaches the eyeballs of actual soldiers--a development that Darpa says is still years away--Pound doesn't deny that the interface would be used for actual offensive hacking as well as defense and reconnaissance. Like the rest of Plan X, he says it's meant to be a simpler and more intuitive way for the U.S. Cyber Command and other American military hackers to visualize everything they do in their cyberwar operations. ""Think of Plan X like an aircraft carrier,"" says Pound. ""It can carry any weapon system or capability.""

That sort of admission will no doubt set off alarm bells for critics of the American military's increasingly aggressive posture on the Internet. The revelation in 2012 that the United States created the Iran-targeted Stuxnet malware and a year of Edward Snowden's leaks have already demonstrated that the NSA engages in more advanced cyberattack operations than practically any country on the planet. Enabling American hackers to launch those attacks with a tool that's literally designed for video games could be seen as encouraging a brazen attitude towards cyberwar, disconnecting it from the reality of its consequences.","The main unintended consequence of virtual reality being used for military purposes is that it could desensitize soldiers to the reality of war. If soldiers are constantly fighting in a virtual world, they may become less capable of empathizing with the real-life consequences of their actions. This could lead to more collateral damage and civilian casualties, as soldiers become less concerned with the human cost of war.",https://www.wired.com/2014/05/darpa-is-using-oculus-rift-to-prep-for-cyberwar/,2014-05-23 10:30:34+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.99619859457016,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
67,"Magic Leap, and the Troubles In Sexism Valley","Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality tech startup that's valued at $4.5 billion (and reportedly bores Beyoncé), settled a sex discrimination lawsuit this week. The plaintiff, Tannen Campbell, a former vice-president of strategic marketing, was hired to make the company's product more appealing to women. Campbell filed a notice of settlement Monday in federal court in Florida, Magic Leap's home state, and the terms of the settlement are confidential. (Representatives for both Campbell and Magic Leap said they couldn't comment.) If all goes smoothly, the suit will officially end by the beginning of next month.

But Magic Leap's problems won't. Since the company's founder, Rony Abovitz, appeared on WIRED's cover a year ago, Magic Leap has faltered, beleaguered by bad press and allegations of unfulfilled promises. That's a long way from 2014, when Silicon Valley was all abuzz over the stealthy startup. Google, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Andreessen Horowitz and other titans of venture capital all rushed to invest in the company and its “mixed reality” software that lets people see virtual 3-D objects superimposed over the real world. Despite garnering $1.4 billion in funding to date, however, Magic Leap has found itself facing a slew of accusations that it may have wildly over-promised on its tech. Questions now abound over whether the company will ever deliver a product.

Thanks to Campbell's lawsuit, a whole new host of questions have arisen, as well as a sinking suspicion that the company is even more dysfunctional than previously thought. Excessive hype is one sign of a company possibly foundering due to mismanagement. Misogyny of the kind alleged by Campbell suggests dysfunction on a whole other level. As incidents of sexism in tech pile up, it's becoming clear that misogyny in the industry is both a moral travesty and a potential warning sign that a business is in trouble.

Campbell filed the suit in February alleging that Magic Leap fostered a misogynist work environment and then fired her for speaking out about it. Among other things, the suit alleges that Magic Leap executives were dismissive of input from female employees. The suit also claims that employees were told women had trouble with computers. (In a quote that has already gone viral, one IT lead allegedly said, ""In IT we have a saying; stay away from the Three Os: Orientals, Old People, and Ovaries."") In all, the suit alleges, the company cultivated an overall culture utterly inhospitable to women. (The suit describes a game meant to ship with the Magic Leap headset in which a female character is ""depicted on her knees groveling at the [male] heroes’ feet"" in admiration.)

What's more, the suit claims Magic Leap did little in an effort to fix its culture when Campbell raised the issue. She alleges that she tried six times to give a presentation about gender diversity in the workplace without success. A ""Female Brain Trust Initiative"" and a ""Women’s Inclusion Network"" were eventually formed, but the groups allegedly had no stated goals or support from management and stagnated as a result.

To be clear, the suit's allegations are just that, and given the settlement, they'll never likely get a hearing in open court. Magic Leap, for its part, filed a point-by-point response in federal court denying it engaged in any kind of discrimination. But the mere existence of the suit is not a good look in an industry where women typically comprise about 30 percent of a given company's workforce. Even with many companies overtly seeking to diversify their workforces in recent years, that ratio has stayed about the same, much as it has for the maddeningly dismal figures for hiring people of color in the industry.","It may cause people to become more isolated from one another.

68,Are Virtual Drugs a Gateway to the Real Thing?,"Technology Review: Why do you believe that virtual drugs will make people less likely to experiment with drugs in real life?

Brian Shuster: First drug use rarely occurs in a vacuum. Rather, it is a social phenomenon brought on by peer pressure. In a virtual environment, the pressure shifts from trying actual drugs to experimenting with virtual drugs. Thus, users have a safe platform to explore the social aspects of drug use, without having to risk doing the actual drugs.

By separating the social pressure from the real-world application, users have a totally revolutionary mechanism to deal with peer pressure, and actually to give in to peer pressure, without the negative consequences.

Moreover, users of virtual drugs have reported the effects of these virtual drugs to be surprisingly realistic and lifelike. To the extent that users can enjoy both the social benefits of virtual drugs as well as the entertainment associated with drug use, all with no actual drug consumption, the value of taking actual drugs is diminished.

Hopefully the people who are making these reports are not one-time drug virgins for whom Red Light Center was a “gateway” to the real stuff, but longtime users who are now using technology to help kick their chemical habits.

TR: Do you have any evidence to back this up?

BS: To this point, the evidence is, as Albert Einstein might say, all the result of thought experiments. Virtual ecstasy has not been released to the public and is making its world debut on April 20. Virtual marijuana and mushrooms have only recently been introduced for users to try, so there has not yet been an opportunity to perform studies.

Utherverse is, at this time, however, investigating a study to determine if smoking virtual cigarettes can enhance traditional stop-smoking measures to assist smokers in their efforts to quit. We hope to run a scientifically founded study later this year.

TR: Wouldn’t virtual drugs make users more likely to want to try out drugs in real life?

BS: We hope that by preparing people to deal with peer pressure by allowing them to go through a virtual dry run, they will be better equipped to make rational decisions if the situation later occurs in their real life.

Just as with the sexual experimentation within Red Light Center, users will have the ability to decide for themselves whether using drugs is an enhancement or detriment to their life experience, even before ever using drugs in the real world. Armed with that information, they can then make more-rational decisions if they are confronted with that choice in the real world because they will have already gone through it virtually.

That said, it is critical to recognize that users who develop a full social circle within Red Light Center will have an online support structure of friends. Being accepted into a social community and having genuine friends are defenses that can be called on to prevent substance abuse in the real world. There is no reason to believe that this wouldn’t hold true for online users, and thus provide them with additional deterrence to ongoing real-world drug use.

Finally, as users attend more events and social functions online, the exposure to situations that arise in the real world, whereby the user may be pressured into trying or using drugs, will naturally diminish. Thus, by reducing the real-world exposure to peer-pressure situations and moving those situations to a safe, online environment, first-use [experimental] drug use resulting from peer pressure would naturally decline.

Of course, opponents of virtual drugs would counter that by providing a positive drug experience online, users would then be inclined to have a positive feeling about drugs and would be more inclined to experiment with them in the real world. To that I would respond by saying that if it is true that getting a positive reward for virtual behavior inclines someone to that behavior in the real world, well, drugs aren’t the big problem. Violent video games would be much more of a concern. Unspeakably violent video games have been rewarding players for violence for decades in the name of good old-fashioned entertainment. If opponents believe that giving users a nice high in a game will make them want to do drugs in the real world, how could they permit games that give users a high from killing and maiming other users? The answer is that they must believe that in-game rewards don’t really result in real-world actions. We feel the same logic holds true for virtual drugs.

TR: RedLightCenter.com states that it is only for adults, not for children. Will there be a virtual drug area for children? My best friend in high school turned on to pot, cocaine, LSD, and psychedelic mushrooms when we were in 10th grade. If we follow your logic, it seems to me that if virtual drugs are a good intervention, waiting until someone is 18 is too long.

BS: For various reasons, Red Light Center will not be made available to minors, nor do we have any plans or intentions to permit minors to use our software at any point in the future.

Although as an intervention tool Red Light Center would probably be valuable as you imply, real-world politics and situations simply make this an unrealistic option.

However, to the extent that many drug users have not used destructive drugs before they are 18, and to the extent that Red Light Center can provide an alternative outlet to real-world drug use beyond deterring first experimentation, there is still a lot of value, even if it is limited to [those] 18 years or older.

And, of course, we aren’t putting this product out as a way to stop drug use. That’s simply a side effect. We are putting out virtual drugs because they are fun and because they make our parties much better!","It may make users more likely to want to try out drugs in real life.

69,How to Stop Virtual Reality from Making You Want to Puke,"This conflict is what Wetzstein, an assistant professor of electrical engineering, and other researchers at Stanford are trying to solve with the headset I tried on, which they call a light field stereoscope—essentially, a device that uses a stack of two LCDs to show each eye a “light field” that makes virtual images look more natural than they typically do.

Sample images show what it looks like to use the light field stereoscope to focus on parts of a 3-D scene that appear to be at different depths.

In real life, when you’re looking at something—a flower, for instance—your eyes move and the lens in each eye adjusts to bring whatever’s in front of you into focus. With stereoscopic 3-D, a technology commonly used by companies making virtual reality headsets, things gets trickier. In this case, each eye is shown a slightly different image of the same thing; your brain then combines these images to achieve a sense of depth. But since you’re looking at a flat, lit-up display in the distance and focusing on the 3-D images that appear to be in front of you, it can result in nausea and dizziness. Unless the technology improves, this could make it hard for some people to truly interact with virtual reality up close, regardless of whether they’re playing a first-person-shooter game or controlling a surgical robot.

“When you want to touch virtual objects, things that are close by, and you want to interact with them, it becomes very important,” Wetzstein says.

In hopes of making the stereoscopic virtual-reality experience more like what you see in real life, the Stanford researchers built a headset that contains two LCDs placed one in front of the other, with a backlight behind them, a spacer between them, and lenses in front of them. It’s connected to a computer that runs software necessary for the system to work.

The computer starts with a 3-D model, which the researchers’ software renders for each eye as a light field—in this case, Wetzstein says, it’s a five-by-five grid of slightly different 2-D images of the model, so 25 images in total for each individual eye. An algorithm uses the light fields to generate two images for each eye, and, for each eye, one of these images is shown on the rear LCD in the headset, while the other is shown on the front LCD. The images enter your pupils and are projected on your retinas.

What you see, Wetzstein says, is an approximation of the light field that’s being optically generated, which your eyes can freely move around and focus on where they want in virtual space.

“That’s normally not possible,” he says.

Wetzstein says the technology that goes into the headset is inexpensive and doesn’t require eye-tracking to figure out where the viewer is gazing, and he hopes it can be incorporated into headsets that come out several years from now. A paper about the work will be presented in August at the Siggraph computer graphics and interaction conference in Los Angeles.

Marty Banks, an optometry and vision science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is also working on research into how to solve the problem of getting proper focus cues in virtual reality—he coauthored a paper that will also be presented at Siggraph that he says shows higher-resolution images but requires eye tracking. Banks says the display that Wetzstein and other researchers are working on is cool and clever, but notes that the resolution is still pretty low (the Stanford group’s paper indicates scenes displayed had a resolution of 640 by 800 pixels).

“That’s going to be a major thing to solve: how to get the resolution up. So that’s going to require more computation and more pixels and more expense,” he says. “There’s a ways to go there.”","It can result in nausea and dizziness.

70,Drone Racing League Will Give You a Wild Robot's-Eye View in VR,"You may not have heard of the Drone Racing League yet. It’s not even a year old. They haven’t even released video of their first race to the public. League CEO Nick Horbaczewski says the DRL is strictly in stealth mode at the moment, planning events and preparing for a big 2016.

Next year, the league plans six races scattered across the United States. There’s also a race set for December in Miami. But don’t think about buying tickets: Horbaczewski says the DRL sees itself just as much as a production company as a sports league, with the emphasis being on producing compelling content that will make viewers feel like they’re flying. Or better yet, starring in their own sci-fi movie.

“It’s really visual, it’s really immersive, it’s engaging and fast,” says Horbaczewski. “It has all the heritage of racing, but it’s in three dimensions. Whenever I talk about drone racing, people mention the pod-racing scene in Star Wars. Or the speeder bikes on Endor. And most of that was CGI, so we have to bridge the reality of racing with peoples’ sci-fi movie expectations. And I think we can do that. That’s what we’re working on with our content ... Flying robots with cameras on them. It’s pretty cool.”

Some high-profile investors agree. Earlier this year, the league announced that RSE Ventures, the venture-capital firm headed by Miami Dolphins owner Steve Ross, pitched in $1 million to help fund the league. Horbaczewski says the DRL isn’t ready to announce its full list of investors, but that there are “some exciting names on it from the sports media and entertainment space.”

As the league prepares for a big 2016 push, it wants to make sure its drones are ready for the spotlight. The league itself builds the racing drones, all to the same specifications. Those specifications change from race to race to keep things interesting. The pilots just show up and fly without having to worry about wrecking their robots. If one crashes, the Drone Racing League’s own pit crew handles repairs and replacements.

Horbaczewski likens the league to Formula 1 or NASCAR. The drivers don’t need to worry about tuning up their engine or replacing tires. They’re just there to compete. The DRL wants to treat its pilots the same way, and there’s a perk to having the league design and supply the drones. The pilots are more likely to take risks in a race if they don’t have to worry about repairing their vehicles, which makes the race videos more exciting.

“The drone-racing world is still small enough that you can kind of keep your arms around it,” Horbaczewski says, explaining how the league intends to find new pilots. “So we know a bunch of pilots, and they know a bunch of pilots. Every day, we find somebody new on YouTube posting videos of themselves flying, and they’re an amazing pilot. And I think once we have organized competition, the system will sort of shake itself out in terms of bringing people in.”","Since drone racing is still in its infancy, the main unintended consequence of virtual reality being used to enhance the experience is that it may give pilots an unfair advantage. If pilots are able to fly in a virtual world that is identical to the real world, they will be able to learn the track much faster and will have a better understanding of how to fly their drones. This could lead to a situation where the best pilots are those who are able to fly in virtual reality, rather than those who have the most experience in the real world.",https://www.wired.com/2015/11/the-drone-racing-league-is-a-sport-built-for-vr/,2015-11-17 17:55:26+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.98912113904953,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"

Imagining the Future of VR Storytelling at Google

Jessica Brillhart is the principal filmmaker for virtual reality at Google. But what, exactly, does that mean? In an interview with our editor in chief, Jason Pontin, she explains that she gets to explore how everything from exotic 16-camera rigs to cheap cardboard headsets could be used to provide new experiences that traditional film cannot. It may sound like one of the more cushy and creative Silicon Valley jobs, but it poses some challenging puzzles. “VR is an embodied medium: creators are taking [a] detached eye and reattaching it to someone’s face,” she explains. “VR reminds us of the nuances of experiences, what connects people with each other, with places, with things in the real world. And that to me is the key to really understanding what kind of storytelling could even exist in a VR space.”



Converting Climate Change Deniers

There’s an ever-growing base of evidence to support the fact that humans cause climate change—and it's (slowly) nudging public acceptance of the phenomenon to increase. The results of global warming are manifest around the planet. The 700-foot high Oroville Dam currently teeters on the brink of disaster, with a climate-exacerbated double blow of drought and flood causing operators to use its emergency slipways and evacuate nearly 200,000 people. Sea ice levels have hit record lows at both poles. And in Australia, longer heat waves are causing increased bushfire risk. A new equation suggests that humans are causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces. And, in the UK at least, people are willing to believe it: more people than ever there now believe that climate change is real. How long until the new White House administration follows suit?

72,Avengers: Damage Control Pushes VR to New Heights,"Dobbs Beck So in every project, we have the Void, we have ILMxLab, and we have the IP owner. In Secrets of the Empire, because ILMxLab is actually part of Lucasfilm, we were sort of two halves of a whole there. That was really helpful, because we were treading in very new territory, and so from a story and a franchise perspective, people have to get comfortable with what stories we were going to tell and how we were going to tell them in this new platform. The fact that we were literally down the hall from the story department made that much easier than it perhaps would have otherwise been.

Then, when we were doing Ralph Breaks VR, Walt Disney Feature Animation was heavily in production on the film, and the project actually came out very close to the film release. So in that case it was interesting, because while we were working with one of the writers from the actual film, and she was kind of a critical link between the film and the VR project, they were actually kind of removed from the process and really trusted us to carry forward to the spirit of what the film was and the franchise was overall—because we were actually telling something that was not a duplicative story to what was happening in the film, it was actually complementary.

You know, Marvel's much like Lucasfilm in the fact that there's a really comprehensive franchise strategy, because it's such a rich world with so many characters and intersecting stories. So in that case, Dave Bushore, who is VP creative for the franchise, played the role of like executive producer and was extremely involved in the very beginning: What story are we going to tell? How do we tell it? How do we make it consistent with what they were striving to do in the Marvel universe?

Hickman: When I and my cofounders first started the Void, I made a list of laws that kept growing, so I decided to limit it to 52. It's a deck of playing cards—four categories of 13. Creatively and practically, this is what the dream was. There's a bunch of those; we could probably talk all day on those, as everyone at ILMxLab knows, because I won't shut up about it. But it's things like: You're going to be you in the experience. The goal in the end, when you go to the Void, is that you're going to step through this portal as if you were going into another dimension, but you're fundamentally still you in the Void. If you want to pretend to be somebody, that's great, but you being you is just a fundamental part of reality.

All these laws are like that. If the goal is to walk into Star Wars as if you were stepping into another room, then what sort of laws and rules do we have to pay attention to in order to make that work? Some of those have to do with wish fulfillment, like what are you gonna be doing in the new world. Some of those things are magic-related, like getting people immersed using psychology, and alief versus belief. But it's this system of rules and laws that have sort of helped guide every Void experience and provide a bit of a track for some of the studios and people who are coming from this film world and stepping into this new medium—a bit of a direction of where the experience is going to go.","The potential for people to become addicted to virtual reality and the negative impact this could have on their real lives.

Some background: Orthopedic training requires a 14-year commitment after high school to become an independent surgeon.

The news: Eight US residency programs—Columbia, UCLA, Harvard, and Vanderbilt among them—have committed to bring Osso VR, a virtual-reality teaching program, into their schools. “The expansion of virtual reality training into residencies is a major milestone,” says Justin Barad, Osso VR’s CEO. “It is an acknowledgement that there are training gaps that exist that are not adequately being met by more traditional technologies and methods.” A similar tool made by ImmersiveTouch has found its way into the residency program at Johns Hopkins.

Learning in VR: Virtual reality is increasingly being used for training in a variety of industries. Walmart even used headsets to prepare associates for last year’s Black Friday rush.

Why it matters: With robots taking learning opportunities away from young doctors, new tools like these are needed. “This will not only greatly enhance the ability to produce skilled orthopedic surgeons, but also reduce the time of training and increase the capacity to assess skill,” says Schoenecker. “Most importantly, this should lead to safer clinical practice.”","The main unintended consequence of virtual reality being used in medical residencies is that it may lead to surgeons being over-reliant on the technology. This could lead to surgeons making mistakes when they are not using virtual reality, or when the technology fails.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/06/12/142347/tomorrows-surgeons-are-learning-by-doing-in-vr/,2018-06-12 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9549914598464966,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
74,How Madison Avenue Is Wasting Millions on a Deserted Second Life,"Illustration by Eddie Guy __ For months, Michael Donnelly __had been hearing all about the fantastic opportunities in Second Life.

As worldwide head of interactive marketing at Coca-Cola, Donnelly was fascinated by its commercial potential, the way its users could wander through a computer-generated 3-D environment that mimics the mundane world of the flesh. So one day last fall, he downloaded the Second Life software, created an avatar, and set off in search of other brands like his own. American Apparel, Reebok, Scion — the big ones were easy to find, yet something felt wrong: ""There was nobody else around."" He teleported over to the Aloft Hotel, a virtual prototype for a real-world chain being developed by the owners of the W. It was deserted, almost creepy. ""I felt like I was in The Shining.""

Yet Donnelly decided to put money into Second Life anyway. He's no digital naïf: When he joined Coke last summer, the company was being ridiculed for its huffy response to a spate of Web videos showing the soda geysers that erupt when you drop Mentos into Diet Coke. Within weeks, Donnelly had Coke and Mentos sponsoring a contest on Google Video that's gotten more than 5.6 million views. But Second Life was different. ""Many places you go, there's still nobody there,"" he concedes. That's certainly the case with Coke's Virtual Thirst pavilion, where you can long linger without encountering another avatar. ""But my job is to invest in things that have never been done before. So Second Life was an obvious decision.""

As with Donnelly and Coca-Cola, so with David Stern and the National Basketball Association. Stern, who's been NBA commissioner since 1984, was introduced to Second Life in July 2006, at the annual media and technology retreat hosted by New York investment banker Herbert Allen in Sun Valley, Idaho. Second Life's creator, Philip Rosedale, was one of the presenters, as was Chad Hurley, cofounder of YouTube, another company Stern had never heard of. ""My initial impression was, 'Don't people have better things to do with their lives?' Then I said, 'Stupid! You're not the audience.'""

Stern left Sun Valley convinced he'd seen the future, and he was about half right. YouTube has become a powerful tool for pro basketball. The site's NBA channel, launched in February, has already garnered some 14,000 subscribers; users have posted more than 60,000 NBA videos, which have been viewed 23 million times. But over at Second Life, where an elaborate NBA island went up in May, the action has been a bit slower. ""I think we've had 1,200 visitors,"" Stern reports. ""People tell us that's very, very good. But I can't say we have very precise expectations. We just want to be there.""

Coke and the NBA are hardly alone. Adrift in the uncharted sea that is Web 2.0 — YouTube, MySpace, social networking, user-generated content, virtual worlds — corporate marketers look at Second Life and see something to grab onto. At least 50 major companies have ventured into the virtual world to date, spending millions in the process. IBM has created a massive complex of adjoining islands dedicated to recruitment, employee training, and in-world business meetings. Coldwell Banker has opened a virtual real estate office. Brands like Adidas, H&R Block, and Sears have set up shop. CNET and Reuters have opened virtual bureaus there. It's as if the moon suddenly had oxygen. Nobody wants to miss out.","It may lead to people becoming more isolated from each other in real life.

76,"Intel Might Be Making an Augmented-Reality Headset, Hoping to Cash In on a Rising Industry","Such moves would make sense, as major companies like Microsoft and Google are already involved in augmented-reality projects—Microsoft’s planning to ship its HoloLens headset to developers at the end of March, while Google is reportedly working on a retooled version of Glass meant for several types of work. Meanwhile, startups ranging from the heavily funded Magic Leap, which has raised $1.4 billion, to the much smaller Meta, which has raised $23 million, are also working on headsets.

Chances are, more companies are going to be entering the AR fray in the coming years. Putting together its own headset, especially one that is ripe for others to make on their own, would likely help Intel cash in on growing interest in augmented reality and its sibling, virtual reality—even if it takes either or both a long time to become mainstream.

For the moment, Intel won’t officially confirm whether it has plans for augmented reality. But the person responsible for RealSense, Achin Bhowmik, noted that Intel has previously built prototype products in its efforts to get customers interested in the company’s components.

77,Samsung's New Galaxy Note Doubles as a Virtual-Reality Helmet,"Samsung is serious about phablets, and its three latest announcements add compelling twists to its Galaxy Note lineup. The most straightforward of the company’s new offerings will be the Galaxy Note 4, its latest flagship big-screened phone. Beyond that, things get much more interesting: A Note 4 doppelganger called the Note Edge with a wraparound AMOLED screen, and an Oculus-like VR mask driven by the Note 4, the Gear VR.

Samsung's New Phlagship Phablet

The new Galaxy Note 4 runs Android 4.4 KitKat and has a 5.7-inch AMOLED display with a 2,560 x 1,440 (Quad HD) resolution; that adds up to an incredibly sharp and colorful 518 ppi screen. Its cameras also get significant upgrades. Optical image stabilization bolsters its 16-megapixel main camera, and there’s an 8X digital zoom on that shooter. To reduce pixelation on those digitally-zoomed images, Samsung says the camera uses its own special blend of HDR-like image compositing. The front-facing camera also gets a bump, with a higher-resolution 3.7-megapixel sensor and an F1.9 aperture that helps it perform well in low light. According to Samsung, it also has a 120-degree field of view, which is a much wider-angle lens than most selfie cams.

The Note 4's removable battery is an ample 3,220mAh unit, and the company touts its “Rapid Charge” feature, which can juice the battery 50 percent in 30 minutes. Similar to the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Tab S, the phablet also has an “Ultra Power Saver” mode that the company claims can last 24 hours with just 10 percent battery life.

I can say with confidence that it feels good in the hand. The metal-framed Note 4 has a soft faux-leather back like its predecessor, but there’s no fake stitching this time around. Its S Pen also works more like a mouse on this version; you click the stylus’s side button and drag the pen across text to highlight it, and the same actions allow you to drag-and-drop onscreen items precisely. Along with the user-accessible battery, there’s also a microSD slot that lets you add up to 64GB of extra storage.

All the Note 4 specifics haven’t been revealed just yet. Samsung says it will be available with a 2.7GHz quad-core CPU (likely to be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chip, although Samsung wouldn't comment on the specifics) and with dual quad-core CPUs like the Exynos-based Galaxy Tab S. The pricing has yet to be announced, but the phone will launch on all all four major U.S. carriers in October.

Gear VR: A Phablet-Driven Oculus Rift

Sold separately (at a price yet to be announced this fall) will be the coolest phablet accessory in world history: the Gear VR. This is an Oculus Rift-style headset that works only with the Note 4. You insert the Note 4 into the facemask, and the phone automatically enters VR mode when you dock it into the headset.

The Note 4 docks into the Gear VR headset to provide processing power and an immersive high-res display. Samsung

When docked, the Gear VR uses the Note 4 display and its processing power for full-immersion games and movies, while the headset has its own magnetometer and accelerometer to calculate movement, as well as a proximity sensor to know when it's on your face.","The Gear VR has the potential to be extremely isolating.

78,Augmented reality treatment reduces phantom pain in missing limbs,"Phantom limb pain is a mysterious ailment: people with amputations experience aches and acute pains in an arm or leg that isn’t there — making the problem notoriously difficult to treat. But a new type of therapy using augmented reality is surprisingly effective at reducing even the most intractable phantom pain.

The AR therapy method, first proposed in 2014 by Max Ortiz Catalan of the Chalmers University of Technology, just completed its first, highly promising clinical trial. The team selected 14 amputees whose phantom limb pain was chronic and unresponsive to other therapy methods.

The patients were equipped with myoelectric sensors that detect the signals in muscles that once controlled the missing limb. These signals are tracked and analyzed, and linked to movements in a virtual environment — opening the hand or twisting the wrist of an on-screen limb.

Once this calibration is complete, the virtual limb is superimposed on a live webcam image of the patient, starting just where the real limb stops. The user thinks of movements, and the virtual limb executes them. Over 12 semimonthly sessions, patients were asked to put the virtual limb into various positions, use the sensors to control a car in a racing game, and so on.

Amazingly, by the end of the 12 sessions, reported pain was reduced by about half, and interruptions of daily activity or sleep from it were similarly cut down. The four patients on pain medication reduced their dose, two of them by 81 percent. Six months later, the improvements were still present, implying a lasting therapeutic benefit.

“The results are very encouraging, especially considering that these patients had tried up to four different treatment methods in the past with no satisfactory results,” said Catalan in a news release. “We also saw that the pain continuously decreased all the way through to the last treatment. The fact that the pain reduction did not plateau suggests that further improvement could be achieved with more sessions.”

If the idea that moving a virtual limb around in AR could relieve pain strikes you as strange, don’t worry — it is. But phantom pain is a poorly understood phenomenon and sometimes the effectiveness of treatments is matched only by their strangeness.

Phantom itches are also a problem, for example: imagine how maddening it must be to have an itch you can’t scratch because the limb it’s on isn’t there. The solution, some have been lucky enough to find, is to arrange mirrors so that a limb that’s present appears to be in the place of the missing one. Someone scratches it, and the phantom itch disappears. Believe it or not, this and other forms of mirror therapy are established practice — though not always effective.

This AR-based method is sort of like mirror therapy taken to the next logical level, and it may prove a valuable tool in the treatment of this mysterious but very real condition.

Next up: more tests. 30 patients, this time with leg amputees as well. The paper describing this initial clinical trial was published in The Lancet.","One potential consequence of virtual reality therapy for phantom limb pain is that it could lead to a dependence on the technology. Patients who have used the therapy to successfully reduce their pain may become reliant on it and find it difficult to stop using it. This could lead to a situation where patients are unable to manage their pain without the use of virtual reality, which may not be accessible or affordable for everyone.",https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/02/augmented-reality-treatment-reduces-phantom-pain-in-missing-limbs/,2016-12-02 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9960131645202636,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,TechCrunch,Health & Wellbeing
79,A VR Acid Trip Is All the Fun Without the Pesky Comedown,"There are six people with me. We're all sitting cross-legged on the floor, forming a circle around a glass coffee table. The setting is a comfortable living room in what could be any suburban California home. Judging by the black and white TV set near the wall and the record player next to me, I'd peg the time period as the mid-1960s. My friends are all groovy-looking types with long hair, beads, flowered polyester. Everyone is trying to sit still, but they percolate like they're waiting for something. It's making me anxious, so as they close their eyes and slow their breathing, I slow mine as well.

That's when I notice the orange couch off to the left of me looks a bit less orange than it did a moment before. Wait, now it's bright orange. It keeps desaturating, then saturating. And does the room suddenly look brighter, too? I glance at the grinning blonde girl to my right. She's blissed out. Behind her is a blue chair. Its breathing (uh, yeah, breathing) matches mine.

My friends can't sit still. One strokes the carpet, which appears to be vibrating. Another picks up an African drum and starts tapping. At this point, I'm a little sweaty.

I try to center myself by concentrating on the glass tabletop. It starts rippling, then melts and dribbles all over the floor. The legs fall inward and flames erupt. None of my companions seem surprised to see a raging campfire in the middle of the living room. On the contrary, they're delighted, and grow even more so when the ceiling disintegrates. We all look up at millions of shimmering stars against an ink-black sky. The breathing furniture rises from the floor and slowly floats away as the walls fade. Suddenly we're in the desert, with Joshua trees and alien rock formations beneath vibrant starry sky. The guy to my left slowly turns toward me, a look of ecstasy and terror on his face. We lock eyes. He stares at me intently. I stare back, straight into his soul.

But I'm not out under the stars frying on 500 mics. I'm sitting cross-legged on the floor of a hotel ballroom in Austin, Texas—wearing an HTC Vive and a pair of headphones. Because this trip came courtesy of Origins, a VR experience created to promote the new documentary Orange Sunshine.

The documentary (which is excellent, you should see it!) follows the rise and fall of the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, counterculture rebels from Laguna Beach, California, who were responsible for the distribution of alarmingly pure and potent LSD in the late 1960s and early '70s. The documentary takes its name from the group's most well-known product, which was dumped into the burgeoning counterculture by the truckload. The Brotherhood's little orange pills were responsible for ""turning on"" a significant number of American kids during that era, forever changing the path of the country's popular culture by steering a legion of LSD devotees toward new artistic and spiritual ideals. Ask any old head from back in the day, and she'll tell you: Sunshine was the real shit.",People may become so immersed in the virtual world that they neglect their real lives.

80,"Oculus' Facebook Effect: In VR, Other People Are Everything","Every year at Oculus Connect, the virtual reality company's developer summit, Facebook's footprint gets bigger. That's no surprise: Since the social-media giant bought Oculus for $3 billion in 2014, it's slowly assumed strategic control of the scrappy startup, subsuming it into Facebook's larger organizational structure. Even the summit moved from Los Angeles to Menlo Park-convenient San Jose in 2016. Yet, it's never been as apparent as this year. Beginning with Mark Zuckerberg's opening remarks yesterday morning and continuing throughout the day, Oculus Connect's fifth edition felt more like a Facebook affair than an Oculus one. That's not a judgment; it's as plain as the words on executives' business cards.

But Facebook's ever-increasing presence at Oculus Connect isn't about org charts or how close the convention center is to its offices. It's about the reason the company bought Oculus in the first place. The reason it funds experiments like the goofy VR sandbox Spaces, pumps money into big-budget multiplayer VR games, and is spending what must be a fortune in licensing fees procuring live concerts and sporting events for Venues, its mass-attendance VR app. It's about the steadily growing drumbeat that is by now a John Bonham solo: If VR is to be the next computing platform, it's because of other people.

From the day's start, you could hear it. Zuckerberg wasted no time calling out the idea of co-presence, the overwhelming sense in VR not just of being somewhere real, but being there with another person. ""Just imagine all the ways that being able to feel really present with someone, no matter where they are,"" he said, ""imagine all the ways that's going to change how we communicate, how we game, how we work, almost every category of what we do.""

Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's head of AR/VR, took up the refrain when he spoke about the company's mixed-reality experiments and Oculus' finally-official Quest standalone headset. ""It's not the number of connections that matter,"" he said, as the words appeared behind him on the enormous screen—it’s the depth of those connections. Platitudes born of Facebook's recent ""meaningful interactions"" about-face? Maybe. But triangulating his and Zuckerberg's comments leads you straight to a point that just about everyone in the AR/VR industry agrees on: While the technology can seem cool or surprising in lots of different applications, interpersonal VR experiences often feel deeper, truer, than conventional social media platforms or multiplayer games.

Oculus

No surprise, then, that Oculus' platform and product announcements highlighted VR's social aspects at every turn. Starting with the next Oculus Home update for the Rift rig, users will be able to invite their friends into their private VR domicile—just to hang out, or to watch shows and movies together. Owners of the Oculus Go, the company's lower-end headset that's not quite as suited to immersive social experience, will be able to ""cast"" what they're doing to nearby phones or TVs, so their friends can get a sense of what they're doing. And Venues will be adding NBA games to its schedule, allowing far-flung friends who are fans of rival teams to watch games together, their avatars in jerseys of their choosing.","It may lead to people becoming more isolated from one another. While the technology can provide some amazing experiences, it may also cause people to spend more time in their own virtual world and less time interacting with the people around them.",https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-oculus-connect-social/,2018-09-27 15:56:38.362000+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9943588376045228,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
81,Will Untethered Headsets Like This One Help Reverse the VR Slump?,"“When people want to put it on, they put it on,” says Huang. “They don’t need to turn on the computer, they don’t need to turn on the console. There’s no wiring.”

The company won’t say how much the Pico Neo CV will cost; Huang says only that it will be “very competitive” when compared with existing systems. For now, the prices for consumer-geared high-end headsets plus their controllers and tracking gear range from $499 for Sony’s PlayStation VR to $598 for the Oculus Rift to $799 for the HTC Vive—and that’s not including the gaming console or powerful PC these headsets require.

Consumer virtual reality is still in its earliest days, and sales are still small: market researcher Canalys estimated just north of two million VR headsets shipped in 2016, which is a fraction of the number of, say, video game consoles that sold during the same period. There are plenty of issues standing in the way of adoption by the masses, such as the costs to get started with the technology, the dearth of available content, and those pesky wires.

Besides Pico Interactive, a number of companies—both chip manufacturers like Qualcomm and Intel and headset makers like Facebook-owned Oculus—see wireless headsets as the ultimate goal for virtual reality. But those that are available today tend to be simpler and depend on smartphones to function, like Samsung’s Gear VR and Google’s Daydream.

I got a feel for the headset at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where I played a short game that was like a simplified version of the laser scene from Entrapment—basically, stepping over and around some virtual red laser beams to get from one end of a dingy, industrial hangar to the other. The headset’s tracking worked well, and the graphics looked good even as I spun around. It was surprisingly comfortable, with a padded headband and simple wheel in the back to tighten it up, and much lighter than the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive.

But the Pico Neo CV won’t be as powerful as a headset that’s connected to a computer or gaming console, and it won’t have a ton of storage space for games (it will support up to 128 gigabytes of storage with a memory card).

Gartner analyst Brian Blau says it doesn’t really matter what technology goes into the headset; ultimately, it simply matters whether or not users have a good experience.

“VR today is an overhyped technology,” he says. “People are very excited about it, but the devices can’t deliver what people imagine they should, so there’s a lot of disappointment. And it’s up to Pico and their competitors to convince users otherwise.”","The potential for isolation and loneliness that comes with using the technology.

It's the latest craze to hit SecondLife: the virtual Masonic fez. Worn by gorgeous babes like Isis Eagle over here on the right, the fez has become something of a lust object among the fetish-hungry masses on SL who have grown tired of dragon furry sex and polygon perversion. What is it that makes the Masonic fez so hot? Apparently it's something to do with the idea of sex occuring in a mystical fraternal order connected with the origins of our glorious nation, the United States of America. Of course, these virtual Masonic fezzes are worn by ladies, so there's a bit of revisionist history here: Ladies can't be Masons in the real world, nor are they among our nation's founders.

83,Cyberpunk 2077 and the Meaning of Its Deadly Dildos,"Push past the beaded entryway of room six at the No-Tell Motel in Cyberpunk 2077, and there she is: a statuesque, blondish woman perched on the edge of an animal-print-covered bed. She’s in a cupless bra with black tape covering her nipples, and there’s a cherry-red dildo to her right.

“Bet you didn’t expect to see me here,” she says.

After the blockbuster video game’s main character, V, has sex with her, the reward lays on the bed. It’s the same dildo from before, only now transformed into a melee weapon. The dildo “may not be lethal,” according to its profile in the weapons inventory, but “it’s perfect for when someone is just asking to get fucked.”

“Sir John Phallustiff,” as the weaponized sex toy described above is called within the game, isn’t just a one-off flourish. Plenty like it can be found in this intricately designed dystopia. Stroll through the dressing room of Lizzy’s bar and you’re greeted with a spiked bronze dildo and a butt plug upright on a shelf. Peer underneath a car and you’ll see a dildo staring back at you. Dildos are everywhere in Cyberpunk 2077, as many players have discovered. But why?

SUBSCRIBE Subscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.

A representative for the company behind the game, CD Projekt Red, claimed last week that the abundance was a bug. “We wanted Night City to be pretty open sexually,” the rep told Business Insider, but too many sex toys were showing up as random items strewn throughout the gaming world. “We're going to adjust them so that the dildos don't appear too out of place/context and distracting.” Meanwhile, a designer at the company who told me that he wished to remain anonymous an account of the “tumultuous PR” around the game said they’d put in all the dildos for two reasons: to be controversial, and also “to represent the cyberpunk future as sex-positive.”

Whatever the designers’ intent, the ubiquitous dildos in Cyberpunk 2077 send a very specific message, and it’s not sex-positive. In the game, dildos are either classed as weapons on their own terms, or as “junk” to be dismantled and reused to make more important things, like … weapons. Dildos are not depicted here as tools for sexual pleasure, but rather as the litter of a decaying world, and a makeshift means of doing violence. If anybody in this future actually does masturbate with dildos, apparently they toss them on the ground right after. Maybe that’s because in Night City, sex-toy technology has somehow failed to improve at all by 2077. While V’s body can be enhanced with newest tech (titanium bones, bioplastic blood vessels, etc.), the game’s artificial dicks are stuck in the early 2000s: standard penis replicas, nary a clitoral suction device in sight.

Game designers know that disembodied dicks are funny. That’s why the South Park video games are teeming with them; and it’s why 2016’s Genital Jousting was such an indie hit. But when it comes to science fiction, there’s likely more to it than that. In a futuristic context, dildos often serve as stand-ins for our disconnected selves, signs that we have lost our humanity. Sometimes the devices even enact violence on their users, punishing humans for replacing skin-on-skin sex with technology. The sex machine in Barbarella (1968) gives Jane Fonda’s character the best orgasm of her life, then nearly kills her. “You’ve exhausted its power. It couldn’t keep up with you … Shame on you!” its inventor yells. The orgasmatron in Woody Allen’s Sleeper (1973) is a symbol of a soulless society, a world where men are impotent and women frigid. Westworld’s (2020) sex robots reside in a pleasure-filled theme park for the rich, until they rise up and destroy their human creators.

Notably, the future is never portrayed as a technological utopia world brimming with sexually fulfilled women vibrating themselves to orgasm. A world like this would be too threatening to gender roles. In fact, as I wrote in my book Buzz: A Stimulating History of the Sex Toy, for more than a millennium, when dildos appeared in stories—whether told through poems, plays, or another medium—they often served to illustrate a common fear: that sex toys would replace men and topple society. In Aristophanes’ Lysistrata, from around 411 BCE, women go on a sex strike to encourage their husbands to end the Peloponnesian War—and some of the women get dildos as replacements. In the 16th-century poem “The Choosing of Valentines, or The Merie Ballad of Nashe His Dildo,” Thomas Nashe tells a story of a sex worker so unsatisfied by her lover that she turns to a dildo instead. She rhapsodizes about the toy’s superiority to a penis—it always stays hard, and won’t get her pregnant. It’s in keeping with this tradition that Cyberpunk 2077 would transform dildos from masturbatory devices into weaponry, as a way of neutralizing the dildo’s threat to masculinity and turning fear of replacement into power.

Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t even the first game to make this symbolic gesture. In Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, released in 2004, players could wield a dildo affixed to a chainsaw, a floppy purple dildo club, or a phallic vibrator weapon. (Some of these may double as gifts for the main character’s girlfriend.) Dead Rising 3 (2013) has a leaf blower that shoots zombie-killing purple vibrators like a T-shirt gun. Saint’s Row the Third (2011), Saint’s Row IV (2013), and the expansion pack Gat Out of Hell (2015) all provide the muscly main character with a 3-foot dildo bat for beatdowns. Unsurprisingly, it’s much more common in video games to see men bludgeoning each other with sex toys than it is to see a woman masturbating with them. The only game from a major publisher that shows the latter is the controversial Grand Theft Auto V (2013). And even there, the woman gets interrupted by her husband: “I thought I’d locked the door,” she says as she tosses the buzzing pink phallus into the corner of the room.

For decades, feminists have championed sex toys as a way for women to gain control of their own sexuality. “It was my intention to introduce electric vibrators to women, and in the process, transform the women's movement into a tidal wave of orgasmic activists who would change the world,” second-wave feminist and masturbation pioneer Betty Dodson wrote in 2010. So it’s disheartening that sex toys are rarely used for sexual pleasure in video games. What’s even worse is the fact that they are often used to commit acts of virtual violence against women in particular. Dozens of videos of Cyberpunk 2077’s quest for Sir John Phallustiff blanket YouTube, most blurring out the tame sex scene that unfolds right before V earns the dildo melee weapon. In one of the most popular of these videos, the censored consensual sex scene is followed soon after with crystal-clear video of V bashing a woman’s head with the giant dildo, blood spraying through the night air as she falls face first into the concrete.","It can lead to a desensitization to violence.

84,"Dystopian Marketers, Unite: Facebook to Start Dropping Ads Into VR Spaces","VR advertising is upon us, and right in your face.

VR Ads

Facebook is starting to squeeze ads into the magical virtual reality environments enabled by its Oculus Quest VR headset — a move that shouldn’t come as a surprise to anybody who’s noticed Facebook’s approach to innovation.

In other words, the dystopian nightmare future of having ads pop up inside magical virtual worlds, unavoidably, right in your face? It’s already upon us. The company however is hailing the change as an easy way for developers (read: Facebook) to squeeze more money out of their VR games and apps.

In a test, the social media platform chose to include display ads inside a first-person shooter arcade game developed by Resolution Games. It’s using first-party data to make sure the ads are relevant — but arguably, no matter how relevant, the decision only comes to the demise of those who have already invested in the Quest platform.

Those consumers will also have to suck it up or invest in a different platform. In fact, in order to actually make use of Facebook’s $299 Oculus Quest 2, users are forced to sign in with Facebook.

More Revenue

The Mark Zuckerberg-led company is trying to sell off the ad idea as a way to make VR a “self-sustaining platform” by allowing developers to generate revenue. “It also helps us continue to make innovative AR/VR hardware more accessible to more people,” a polished-by-the-PR-team blog update by the Oculus team reads.

“For now, this is a test with a few apps,” the post reads. If all goes well, Oculus is ready to roll out apps “across the Oculus Platform and in the Oculus mobile app, as well as guidance for businesses and developers interested in advertising on Oculus.”

Facebook is taking a privacy-first approach and is promising to “not use information processed and stored locally on your headset to target ads.”

The social media company is also reportedly working on a smartwatch, and has announced it is building a pair of AR glasses. It’s still unclear if those platforms will also eventually be flooded with ads — but it wouldn’t exactly be a surprise.

We’re still not entirely sure what form the VR ads will take. Facebook is trying out “new ad formats that are unique to VR,” but didn’t specify what that would look like, as The Verge points out.

Either way, the move to include ads won’t come as a welcome addition to literally anybody playing games or using apps in VR right now.

85,This Augmented-Reality Robot Is The Closest Thing You Can Get To A Real-Life Hologram,"Ready to have your brain blasted to bits? U-Tsu-Shi-O-Mi is a “virtual assistant” that is actually a green-clad humanoid robot. Users look at her using virtual reality goggles and instead of seeing a mildly creepy, ninja-like blog they see an actual face and body. You can reach out, touch the body, and even shake hands with your robotic pal.

Made by a Japanese company called Different Dimension Inc., the robot uses a program called MMDAgent to interact with users. An initial prototype looked like a ‘tween in footie pajamas and a full-face hood. The newest version consists of half of a body and a much smaller profile. The pre-order price will be about $5,000.

Unfortunately the system still requires a VR headset and some solid computing power. However, because the entire package is so compact, you could imagine approaching a little green figure while wearing smaller VR glasses and interacting without much fuss. Interacting with a tiny green figure is obviously quite creepy – especially if passers-by don’t know what’s up – but what did Clarke say about technology and magic?

86,A Crazy Oculus Rift Hack Lets Men and Women Swap Bodies,"The great promise of the Oculus Rift headset the chance to inhabit fantastic new worlds. A group of researchers in Barcelona are already using it for something even more radical: inhabiting new bodies.

BeAnotherLab, an interdisciplinary group of students at the University Pompeu Fabra, in Barcelona, has relied on an early version of Oculus Rift as part of an on-going research project called ""The Machine To Be Another."" The concept is just what the name suggests. An early experiment let participants experience the creative process through someone else's eyes, in real time. The latest undertaking is even wackier. It lets men and women swap bodies. (Note: The video below contains nudity.)

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Here's how it works. Each subject is outfitted with an Oculus Rift headset. Those are supplied with video streams from point-of-view cameras attached to the other person's rig. The participants are instructed to mimic each other's movements, wordlessly dictating the action in tandem like kids playing with a Ouija board.

The effect, says Philippe Bertrand, a Digital Arts student and co-founder of the group, is profound. ""Deep inside you know it’s not your body, but you feel like it is.""

Over the last several months, the group has found a diverse group of researchers interested in their ""embodiment experience platform,"" from artists to therapists to anthropologists. The latest project was focused on VR's potential for fields like gender studies and queer theory, but they're already formulating applications from artistic performances to neurorehabilitation.

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

BeAnotherLab is far from the first to dabble in body swapping. Their project was inspired by teams like Group Ehrsson, in Stockholm, and Event Lab, also in Barcelona, both of which have combined neuroscience and virtual reality in an attempt to untangle complex mysteries about consciousness and the self. Bertrand and company don't see themselves as pioneers so much as a ""low-budget, Creative Commons"" division of this greater movement.

""The discovery of ‘mirror neurons’ by Giacomo Rizzolatti has shown us that you can’t conceive an “I” without an “us,"" Bertrand explains. ""Other recent investigations on embodied simulation are reporting a blurriness of the self related to familiar individuals. Other studies suggest the effectiveness of embodiment for reducing implicit racial bias."" In other words, new research and cutting edge technology are giving us a better understanding of empathy--and new tools for tapping into it.

""It’s a pretty interesting scenario,"" says Bertrand. ""Science is proving out some very hippie concepts, and we're using a video game head mounted display to bring people closer to each other.""","Virtual reality has the potential to create a more empathetic world, but it also has the potential to create a more insular world. People who use virtual reality to inhabit other bodies may become more attuned to the experiences of those around them, but they may also become more detached from their own bodies and their own lives. This could lead to a world in which people are more interested in the lives of others than in their own lives, and in which they are more likely to empathize with those who are like them and less likely to empathize with those who are different from them.",https://www.wired.com/2014/02/crazy-oculus-rift-experiment-lets-men-women-swap-bodies/,2014-02-25 11:30:53+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.996029257774353,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
87,VR's First Big Hit Could Be This Simple Soccer Game,"By this time next year, the next generation of virtual-reality headsets will be in stores. The hardware hooks will be plentiful, with better graphics, higher-resolution displays, faster frame rates, and tons of new games that make the most of all those things.

But the big immersive leap will be VR systems that employ positional tracking. You won't just be able to pivot your head to explore a virtual environment, you'll also be able to move around within it as you would in real life. The HTC Vive (slated for late 2015), Oculus Rift (early 2016), and Sony Project Morpheus (early 2016) will all bring positional tracking into games. It's only these pricer headsets that offer the advanced positional capabilities, so you won't find these features in Gear VR or any of the 360-degree viewers that use smartphones as screens.

However, even this enhanced gameplay won't ensure virtual-reality gaming cracks the mainstream. What VR really needs is a ""Wii Sports"" moment: An accessible, family-friendly game that shows what's different about VR and what makes it so much fun. And because positional tracking can actually be dangerous in the real world---you might bang your shin on a real coffee table or run into a real wall while exploring a virtual environment---it needs to be safe.

Once people see what it's all about, their minds open up to the possibilities. And the possibilities are freaking endless. Headmaster creator Ben Throop on VR's potential

A game called Headmaster from Frame Interactive for Sony's Project Morpheus ticks all those boxes, and it has a good shot at being VR gaming's first mainstream hit. The gameplay and controls are simple---and thanks to the global popularity of soccer, they're also universally intuitive. You don't have a gun in the game, and you don't need any controls other than just wearing a VR headset. If you know how to head a soccer ball, you already know how to play it. And if you're a fan of Magritte, you'll appreciate the game's cover.

A Look Ahead

Here's how Headmaster works: A steady stream of soccer balls launch towards your head from locations all around you, and your job is to head them into targets. Most of those targets are tucked inside a goal in front of you. However, in order to keep things weird and interesting, there are also stages where swaying piñatas and bobbing rubber ducks serve as targets. At one point, a roasted turkey falls from the sky for no apparent reason. The balls also switch up from normal soccer balls to beach balls to explosive orbs, and there are interstitial ""lightning rounds"" where the balls fly at your head at breakneck speed.

""I came up with the idea in June 2014 at a game jam called the Boston VR Bender,"" says Frame Interactive founder and CEO Ben Throop. ""Valve brought its prototype desktop VR hardware to the event, and the jam was all about making positional tracking based experiences. I like to start with game mechanics, and a tracked head is pretty interesting as a control surface. VR is so new that these fundamental ideas haven't been tapped yet. I also play soccer, so really, the concept just came in an instant once I started thinking about the opportunity.""

Throop, who has been making games for 15 years and previously worked at Vicarious Visions/Activision before leaving to develop his own games in 2014, was still a bit hesitant to go full speed ahead on the game. He says that even though the initial prototype of the game was fun, he was still wary about the idea's long-term potential. After stopping development on the game for a few months, he was inspired to pick it back up again after the success of other simple-but-addictive games.

""I found myself repeatedly asking, 'Is this a real game,' because there were no prior models for a heading game,"" Throop says. ""The scope of VR games hadn't been defined. I often thought of mobile games though, like Angry Birds, and how the theme and character of the game can make a single mechanic into a full experience. That made me believe that there was enough depth to heading things to warrant wrapping a world and full game around it.""",It can be dangerous in the real world.

88,Zuckerberg testifies in $2 billion lawsuit that Oculus did not steal core VR tech,"Zuckerberg was forced to leave his signature gray t-shirt at home today and suit up for court.

The Facebook CEO was called to the stand in a Dallas courtroom today to testify in an explosive $2 billion lawsuit which claims that Oculus Inc. (which FB acquired in March of 2014) was built upon technology stolen from Zenimax Media.

The lawsuit is structured around dissecting the help that Oculus founder Palmer Luckey sought out from the employee of ZeniMax-owned games company id Software, John Carmack, when he was building his initial VR headset product. Luckey was under NDA at the time of his meeting with Carmack and others who allegedly assisted the teenage founder in remedying some technical issues that he had been facing in building his Rift VR headset. ZeniMax also claims that Carmack—who would later go on to join Oculus as its CTO when his contract expired—contributed stolen intellectual property to the Oculus team’s core tech upon joining.

In court today, the Facebook CEO remained defiant in the face of the claims.

“Oculus products are based on Oculus technology,” Zuckerberg told the court.

Another quote from Zuckerberg, transcribed (typos corrected) by NYTimes reporter Mike Isaac, has the executive doubting the credibility of the claims made by ZeniMax.

“It is pretty common when you announce a big deal or do something that all kinds of people just kind of come out of the woodwork and claim that they just own some portion of the deal. Like most people in the court I’ve never even heard of ZeniMax before — I know that our legal team would look into this and examine this but they aren’t going to take a lot of my time on something they don’t think is credible.”

In addition to testimony directed towards the case, the courtroom questioning also gave Zuckerberg the opportunity to discuss more intimate details on why the company pursued the Oculus deal in the first place.

""We want to get closer to this kind of perfect representation, so you can capture a moment you had."" Zuck, on Virtual Reality. — ಠ_ಠ (@MikeIsaac) January 17, 2017

Editor’s note: Dan Kaplan helps startups tell their stories. He’s done marketing for Twilio, Asana, and Salesforce and blogs about marketing, growth, and storytelling at Threadling.

There are many people out there who take a pessimistic view of Facebook. To them, Mark Zuckerberg is a huckster, out to sell us the snake oils of distraction and dopamine in exchange for our eyeballs and personal data.

I take the more optimistic view.

I do not believe Zuckerberg is building Facebook to offer the world’s advertisers a better way to target humanity with ads. No, giving advertisers this vaguely sinister power is just a means to an end — a way to create billions of dollars of value on the current Internet while bridging the gap to the Internet of the future.

In my mind, the future Facebook in Zuckerberg’s imagining is much grander, bolder and more futuristic. And what is that futuristic end? It has a lot to do with the Oculus Rift. Before I explain why, let’s talk about the metaverse.

The metaverse?

In the seminal piece of literary sci-fi that is Snow Crash, the author Neal Stephenson imagines a metaverse — a virtual reality world into which the technologists of a collapsed, balkanized America project their avatars.

At the genesis of Stephenson’s virtual reality world (explained briefly in the book), the avatars started off as low-fidelity versions of the people behind them. But as the technology progressed, they became more and more representative and life-like, until the avatars reached the point that they were essentially digital replicas of their owners, projected into the cyber realm.

In Neal Stephenson’s near-futuristic America, this metaverse was made possible by some wearable technology and a virtual reality headset.

The piece he missed was Facebook.

How Facebook can help us project ourselves into virtual reality

In one potential future, the identities we project into the metaverse will be fuzzy or even obscured. Here, our avatars will have little or nothing in common with our actual selves in the real world. They will range from pseudonymous constructions to total fantasies, like the socially-awkward straight male who plays the female dark elf seductress when he enters cyberspace.

In another potential future, the avatars we project into the metaverse will much more closely mirror our actual selves. They will look like us, move like us, reflect our personal mannerisms, and so on. When we socialize in this virtual reality, we will be among friends, just from anywhere in the world with high-speed bandwidth, at anytime we choose.

While it’s entirely possible (even likely) that both of these scenarios will co-exist, the latter future (where we project our real identities) will require some kind of authentic digital identity service that verifies that we are who we say we are, knows who we are friends with, and understands what we like and what we have in common with everyone else.

In other words, it will require something a lot like Facebook.

Social, local, and virtual

For all the hype (some deserved, some inflated) around the intersection of social, local and mobile, that trend will have nothing like the world-changing power at the intersection of social networks and virtual reality.

After the gaming industry has worked out the VR interface kinks (there are a lot) and figured out how to develop credible, fully immersive experiences in a virtual world, it will be time to create something far more profound: the feeling of being “present” with your friends, colleagues and interesting strangers in virtual space.

Virtual reality will be compelling because it will be free-form in ways actual reality can never be. Want to fly around the buildings of San Francisco with your girlfriend? No problem. The Grand Canyon? Sure. Want to have that board meeting in the world’s fanciest boardroom? How about a tropical beach instead?

It gets pretty deep.

Why Facebook spent $2 billion for Oculus VR

Facebook was late to the mobile game. Indeed, Facebook’s inability to control the platforms it relies on for mobile reach (Android and iOS) presents one of the biggest risks to its medium-term success.

This threat is the major reason that Facebook built Facebook Home: to do an end-run around Google and slowly-but-surely command the flow of attention and traffic on tons of Android devices.

Home hasn’t panned out.

But Zuckerberg is a visionary. He knows that smartphones and tablets are not the only interfaces of the future, and he’ll be damned if he misses the next boat.

If you haven’t experienced the feeling of presence in virtual reality, or can’t imagine what the implications of that feeling are, it’s easy to believe that virtual reality isn’t that next boat, that VR is just a bunch of techno-nonsense hype.

But it’s not. Feeling present in virtual reality–your mind believing it is there–is unlike anything else, and that feeling will change the world in all sorts of crazy ways.

As Michael Abrash of Valve points out, the display technology and processing power necessary to create the feeling of presence in VR is already here, and, though the Oculus Rift has a long way to go, it’s as close as anyone has got.

With Facebook’s money behind it, Oculus VR’s team will (likely) be able to nail their product faster and have an easier time bringing it to market at scale.

As Zuckerberg has promised, Oculus VR will start by revolutionizing games. But not too long after that, it will revolutionize digital social interaction, and after that, the world.

For all of this, $2 billion dollars for control of a virtual reality platform looks like a steal.","It could lead to people becoming more isolated from each other.

90,"Steven Soderbergh on VR, iPhone Films, and Harvey Weinstein","Steven Soderbergh is nothing if not ever-evolving—except, maybe, for tireless. After establishing himself as one of his generation’s great auteurs with movies like Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Out of Sight, and Traffic, he vowed to stop making theatrical films. During the supposed hiatus, he made HBO’s Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra, and two seasons of prestige drama The Knick for Cinemax. Then this summer, ""retirement"" over, he returned to the multiplex with the heist flick Logan Lucky.

That wasn’t all, though. He’s also spent the last few years working on Mosaic, an app-based miniseries mystery that viewers navigate their way through, chapter by chapter. (At the end of each node, they can choose which character to follow or which new scene to watch.) For most other directors, it would be a dramatic career turn. But for someone as prolific as Soderbergh, it’s just one of a handful of projects he seems to be constantly working his way through with a savant-like ease.

Soderbergh sat down with WIRED in his Tribeca office (which looks delightfully like where a 1930s gumshoe would set up shop) to share the backstory on his latest project, as well as his thoughts on virtual reality, the future of filmmaking, and the sexual harassment allegations against the man who helped make Sex, Lies, and Videotape a hit: Harvey Weinstein.

Steven Soderbergh on making an app that tells a story:

I was initially reticent—as a filmmaker/storyteller, anything that feels game-y is a little scary because games and being told a story work at cross-purposes. In the game, the viewer has agency, and as a result there’s a certain kind of engagement that happens that isn’t the kind of emotional engagement you get from experiencing a story. So my concern was: Will I still have the kind of control as a filmmaker that I need to have? But what I saw was something that was not a film, and not a game. It was rubbing up against both these things, but was different enough from each to be exciting. The technical innovations that have taken place in gaming over the last decade and a half are stunning, so this seemed like an opportunity to take advantage of a form that has been around a long time—branching narrative—and have the technology be an organic part of the story, as opposed to someone coming along and saying “Oh, I got this piece of new tech, let’s jam a story into it.”

On virtual reality:

There are several things working against it. When you can’t see your protagonist, it’s virtually impossible to hook into the story. This is how we engage, looking into the eyes of the protagonist. There’s no such thing as montage. It’s uncomfortable to have that thing on your head for more than a certain period of time. Part of the joy of anything is watching it with someone else and at a certain point looking at them and going “Holy shit!” That’s gone. To me, there are all these things working against it as a longform, narrative format. I think it’s going to work best as a combination of immersion and gaming and stuff like that, but I don’t… I wish I could short it, I could make a lot of money. But I don’t think I can.

On the value of short TV seasons:","It may make it more difficult for people to connect with and empathize with others.

91,Mark Zuckerberg's VR Selfie Is a Bigger Deal Than You Realize,"A little more than a year ago, Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Oculus Connect, the VR company's developer summit in Los Angeles. Despite having bought Oculus for billions in 2014, the Facebook CEO was a surprise guest, and he kept his remarks short. “There’s always a richer, more immersive medium to experience the world,” he said. “And after video, the next logical step is fully immersive virtual reality.”

Yesterday, Zuckerberg reprised his appearance at Oculus Connect. This time, though, the only thing that felt like last year was the gray t-shirt he wore. For starters, there were 2,500 developers in attendance, more than double last year's turnout. (The summit had relocated to San Jose, a relative stone's throw from Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters. Also, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey was conspicuously absent in the aftermath of the recent scandal around his political trolling.) Then there's the fact that he spoke for more than 20 minutes, announcing everything from funding initiatives to Oculus' work on a self-contained wireless VR headset that would create a new ""standalone"" product category.

Most importantly, though, Zuckerberg slipped on a Rift headset to demonstrate what a Facebook social experience might look like in VR—and in doing so, he made clear that virtual reality's success wouldn't hinge on games, or movies, or concerts. It would hinge on other people.

Putting People First

In the demo, Zuckerberg hung out with two Facebook employees—one of whom, Michael Booth, heads up Facebook's Social VR team. In many ways, it was a more polished version of functionality that Booth showed off at Facebook's own developer summit in April. The trio's avatars were more accurate, if cartoonish, versions of themselves; the 360-degree environments they surrounded themselves with were videos, rather than photos. But when Zuckerberg's wife Priscilla Chan pinged him with a video call via Facebook Messenger, Zuckerberg answered it, bringing a 2-D video feed of Chan into their VR space. On Chan's own phone, she saw the three avatars in the virtual space, and Zuckerberg could even steer her perspective by moving the video feed around. There was, of course, an obligatory selfie—which Zuck then posted from VR to his own Facebook feed.

The demo was unequivocally a prototype—""we still don't have any UI,"" Booth says—but it's more than a proof of concept. It's a proof of priority. When Zuckerberg announced in 2014 that Facebook would be acquiring Oculus, he wrote, ""Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures."" It took another year after that for the Social VR team to form, and almost another year for this demo to arrive, but Zuckerberg's vision is taking shape more quickly than many thought it would.

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

""With VR right now, it's a question of what not to do,"" Booth says of the social VR team's efforts. ""It's just digital putty—we can do anything we want. So we're trying to find the things that are gonna bring the most impact to people, that'll let you share experiences in a really rich way.""

While Facebook's push into social VR may be massive, it's not unilateral. At Connect, Oculus announced its own developments in the social space: new avatars and social hangout rooms that will become part of the Oculus platform over the coming months. And Oculus chief scientist Michael Abrash divulged a little bit of what Oculus' long-range research department was working on, most of which—from gaze tracking to real-time virtual reconstructions of any space you're located in, including virtual versions of the people in the room with you—are geared toward facilitating communication.

For Booth, whose 20-year background in videogame includes stints at Valve and Blizzard, unlocking the social side of VR is a subversion of everything he's used to. ""In the videogame industry, we focused all of our energy on 'we're gonna create an experience for you,'"" he says. ""This is turning that completely around. It's all about putting people first—connecting with your friends. I think we're getting pretty close to that."" But for now, there are selfies.","Isolation.

It was a summer Friday in 2016, and the virtual world he was visiting, AltSpaceVR, was just a year old. Billing itself as a free social network in virtual reality, AltSpaceVR allows its users to toggle between 2-D and 3-D, using a virtual-reality headset or a computer monitor to explore the space. When Soto entered, he found a virtual world that was practically empty: just a few avatars attending quiz shows or cheesy comedy performances. Still, the young preacher was electrified.

In all his years as a pastor, Soto had never had an atheist at his service. In virtual reality church he founded, VR Church, atheists regularly came to listen to him preach about divine love. Jessica Chou

In the months since he’d quit his job as a pastor at a branch of his local megachurch in Reading, Pennsylvania, Soto had been looking for a way to create a radically inclusive church. After all, he had embarked on a career in ministry to introduce as many people as possible to God’s love. Scripture called for men of the cloth to reach into the most unreceptive corners of the world and find common ground with outsiders: the weirdos, the sinners, the dammed, the indisposed. But Christianity, Soto believed, had stalled in this mission. The ministers he knew were happy preaching only to those who walked through their doors on Sunday. The only way to spread the good news as he envisioned, Soto decided, was to found his own church.

Soto’s head buzzed with ideas. He felt called to become a spiritual entrepreneur—an “apostle” in the lingo of some Christian writers whose thinking had come to influence him. Soto imagined bringing religion directly to the people by offering sermons or bible study in unusual places, like backwater towns, CrossFit gyms, campgrounds, and bars. That November, Soto convinced his wife, Kari, to join him on his mission. They sold their home and most of their belongings and piled their five young children into a 30-foot trailer. Their plan was to head to California, by way of backroads, launching a series of pop-up churches along the way.

But gradually Soto’s plan shifted. AltSpaceVR was exactly what he’d been looking for. Across the country churches were rolling out digital offerings—building livestreaming tools and message boards to engage the young and allow seniors, the sick, or disabled people to worship remotely. Soto had even used some of those tools to launch his own church online five years earlier. But virtual reality felt like a radical next step. It felt tangible, a digital world that could convey the feeling of communing in worship.

Two days after he stepped into AltSpaceVR, Soto delivered his first sermon there. He kept at it, hosting services every few weeks. Sometimes he attracted a dozen people; sometimes the virtual room where he preached was empty. He didn’t mind. In all his years as a pastor, Soto had never had an atheist at his service. Now atheists regularly came to listen to him preach about divine love, and they talked openly about their own faith. This was frontier work, he decided. The people who never felt comfortable walking into a house of worship were happy to join him on AltSpaceVR. Ten months after he first strapped on the headset, Soto founded VR Church, the first house of worship to exist entirely in virtual reality.

Religious groups have long attempted to stake claim to digital worlds. As soon as Second Life, one of the earliest two-dimensional virtual worlds, began offering free accounts in 2006, churches, temples, synagogues, and mosques built virtual outposts to host prayer groups, build meditation gardens, and engage in missionary work. But building an institution in a virtual world requires a loyal set of users. As Second Life’s membership declined, so did church membership. The congregations that have lasted have had to migrate often, as users grow tired with the faddish platforms.","It can isolate people from the physical world.

93,String Theory's Weirdest Ideas Finally Make Sense—Thanks to VR,"The robot is building a tesseract. He motions at a glowing cube floating before him, and an identical cube emerges. He drags it to the left, but the two cubes stay connected, strung together by glowing lines radiating from their corners. The robot lowers its hands, and the cubes coalesce into a single shape—with 24 square faces, 16 vertices, and eight connected cubes existing in four dimensions. A tesseract.

This isn't a video game. It's a classroom. And the robot is Brian Greene, a physicist at Columbia University and bestselling author of several popular science books. His robot avatar teaches a semicircle of student robots, each wearing a shoulder badge of their home country's flag. The classroom is outer space: Greene and the arc of student-robots orbit Earth. After he shows the students the tesseract, Greene directs his class to try making four, five, even six dimension objects. This is a virtual reality course on string theory; the lesson happens to be about objects with more than three dimensions.

In real life, Greene is wearing a dark blue shirt, black jeans, and boots, and his normal, non-hovering chair is sitting in a concrete-floored VR business called Step Into the Light planted firmly on Earth's surface—Manhattan's Lower East Side. An HTC Vive headset covers his face, and he gestures effusively—he's a New York native—with the controllers.

Greene is teaching this futuristic class as part of the World Science Festival, a week-long, city-wide celebration of intellect and curiosity. He's actually a co-founder, along with documentarian Tracy Day. In addition to VR classrooms, it features panel discussions on the future of AI, chemistry-themed cooking demonstrations, and ride-alongs with rat scientists. There are events in every borough. Also, cyberspace—and apparently extradimensional space, too.

Extra dimensions are a critical part of Greene's field of study. String theory posits that the universe is built not just from three spatial dimensions (up/down, side/side, forward/backward) and the single dimension of time, but at least six other dimensions. These extra dimensions would be too small for humans to detect—about 10-33 centimeters. But, according to the theory, the six, curled up dimensions play a major role in controlling how subatomic strings vibrate, and those vibrations determine how quarks, electrons, and other fundamental particles behave. Ultimately, these phenomenon scale up to explain modern how gravity and quantum mechanics fit together: Otherwise known as The Biggest Question in Physics. ""String theory,"" says Greene, ""is speculative and hypothetical, but mathematically quite compelling.""

It's also quite confusing. Those six extra dimensions some string theorists predict come wrapped together in what are known as Calabi-Yau manifolds. Greene is a great writer—bestselling, even—but even he can't perfectly explain what these things look like. VR helps him make the shapes make sense. Sort of. Greene brings up a video of a wire in the virtual reality space. To a human, he says, this is a two dimensional object: a line. The video zooms in, and something new appears: an ant, walking in a circle around the wire's girth. The lesson here is that extra dimensions are invisible unless you are the right size to see them.

The analogy with the wire makes sense, but it doesn't scratch all the strangeness away from trying to visualize six dimensional curling. Greene goes on to explain that humans would need microscopes capable of peering inside the smallest particles in order to observe the curled-up dimensions. As he does, the virtual classroom passes through a series of grids—this is to represent shrinking—until everyone is small enough to directly observe the six dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds that exist at reality's most minuscule junctures.

The lesson—designed by Abelana VR productions—is nearly over. Greene reiterates to his students that the extra-dimensional weirdness they spent the past hour exploring together is mostly mathematical conjecture. The classroom scales back up, and now is floating in front of a supermassive black hole.

Still wearing his headset, Greene opens up the floor for questions. One student, from Denmark, asks, ""How does it feel to be teaching in the next step of education?"" As Greene answers—about how it's so wonderful that people from around the globe can gather and share complex ideas like this—a student flings a virtual tesseract at the teacher's head. Next step, indeed.","It may lead to people becoming more isolated from each other. As people are able to immerse themselves in virtual worlds, they may be less likely to interact with the people around them in the real world. This could lead to people becoming more introverted and less interested in the world around them.",https://www.wired.com/2017/06/string-theorys-weirdest-ideas-finally-make-sense-thanks-vr/,2017-06-02 20:35:15+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9913153648376464,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
94,The US Military Developed AR Goggles For Dogs,"""This new technology offers us a critical tool to better communicate with military working dogs.""

Doggles

The US Army is developing augmented reality goggles for dogs to help protect their human guardians.

The BBC reports that the project, funded by the Small Business Innovation Research program, aims to allow soldiers to give dogs specific directional commands while they’re not in direct line of sight.

“Augmented reality works differently for dogs than for humans,” Stephen Lee, an Army Research Laboratory senior scientist, explained in a statement. “AR will be used to provide dogs with commands and cues; it’s not for the dog to interact with it like a human does.”

Pup Squad

Contractor Command Sight created a prototype that includes a pair of goggles, a camera, and display that fits over the dog’s eyes. A visual indicator gives the dog visual cues.

“Much of the research to date has been conducted with my rottweiler, Mater,” Command Sight founder A.J. Peper said in the statement. “His ability to generalize from other training to working through the AR goggles has been incredible.”

Dog-o-Vision

The current prototype requires the handler to keep the dog on a leash, because the goggles aren’t wireless yet.

Even without the ability to give the dog directions through the goggles, “this technology provides one of the best camera systems for military working dogs,” according to Lee, adding that the “handler can see exactly what the dogs sees.”

“This new technology offers us a critical tool to better communicate with military working dogs,” Lee added.

95,Virtual reality desk claims another victim - The Verge,"Last week, my friend and colleague Ben Kuchera posted a video on Polygon about the hidden danger of virtual reality: leaning on a fake desk and falling on your tuchus. I admit, I still giggle at the image of a grown man wearing an expensive virtual reality headset, tethered to a loudly humming computer, dropping to the floor and bruising his tushie.

But I've wondered, since I watched the video, just how common this problem is — or how common it will be when virtual reality headsets spread to consumer in the coming months.

A GIF published to Reddit by Arsanus answers my question. A child, struggling to wear the large headset, searches through a virtual desk drawer that can be seen on a computer monitor in the background. Then the child leans over a virtual desk, and crashes to the floor.

This child is a hero. Seriously, y'all. This child learned the hard lesson — that virtual tables can't hold real weight — so that the GIF might serve as a warning to future children and adults alike. Heed this warning, or one day this could be you. And a friendly reminder, virtual reality is not designed for young children. Practice VR with caution, everybody.

I'm including Kuchera's video so you can hear his explanation of the problem, which is delightful. And here's a link to the full GIF.

Update March 11th, 3:45PM ET: Reader Gregory Brown informed us this is his daughter in the GIF. Brown is an enginer at Seattle VR startup VREAL. ""She came in to the office last Saturday and wanted a turn,"" writes Brown, ""so I put her in it for just a little bit. She and the Vive are all fine. She popped right back up. Amazing to watch her take to it though."" Thanks for writing, Gregory!","People may lean on virtual furniture and fall over.

96,"First They Got Sick, Then They Moved Into a Virtual Utopia","One afternoon in November, Fran Serenade led me and her daughter Barbie down a steep section of the Appalachian trail. The sun was high and Fran hiked briskly, ducking the blue-green diagonals of fir trees, her hair wild behind her. She wanted to show me her log cabin, which was off the trail next to a red barn by a blue lake with a pretty waterfall. Outside the barn, we met Fran’s kitty, Amici, and a handful of other cats, all of them wearing knit caps. Fran pet Amici, who followed her, mewling. Inside the cabin, a fire raged in the fireplace. Fran pointed out her favorite things: an antique icebox; an embroidered tablecloth; a crochet basket. Then we were off to Tai Chi practice.

Sign up to get Backchannel's weekly newsletter, and follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

With her mountain of blonde curls, heart-shaped face, hip-hugging jeans, and tiny waist, Fran recalls a young Dolly Parton. She’s so pretty, she’s almost doll-like. Barbie is slim and pretty, too, though, in her leopard print vest and red lipstick, her look is less country, more glam. Mother and daughter both wore heels, even as we hiked.

It turns out heels work perfectly well on virtual trails, no matter how steep. The trail and cabin we visited exist inside an online virtual world called Second Life. They were designed to recall a real-world trail and cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, where Fran once lived. Fran Serenade is the avatar of Fran Swenson, an 89-year-old former nurse with a head of silver curls and a Brooklyn accent. Barbie is the avatar of Barbara, her daughter in real life.

Fran used to spend her summers in the Blue Ridge Mountains cabin with her husband. Then her husband got Parkinson’s Disease. Slowly he lost control of his body, she tells me, until his ability to breathe slipped away and he was gone. That was in 2003. A year later, Fran received the news: She had Parkinson’s herself. The day she got the diagnosis, Fran allowed herself a couple of hours to despair. Then she sat down and wrote a list of all of the things she would not stop doing, and signed it “The Unsinkable Fran.”

When Fran first entered Second Life eight years ago, the virtual world’s popularity had already peaked. In 2006, membership in Second Life hit 1.1 million. Some members were making good money selling things inside the virtual world: That same year, the first Second Life millionaire graced the cover of Businessweek. It also scored mentions in television programs like The Office and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

At the time, some futurists believed that Second Life was social media’s final frontier, a digital utopia where everyone with an internet connection would eventually take up residence. But traditionalists feared that residents would become so wrapped up in their virtual lives they would neglect their physical selves and offline relationships — that they would live almost exclusively inside Second Life. Then the gamers turned to newer platforms and developers became obsessed with 3D virtual reality. Second Life membership plateaued. Facebook took off instead.

Today, Second Life is mostly forgotten by the broader public. An estimated 800,000 users are active on a monthly basis, according to Second Life parent company Linden Lab. That’s tiny compared to the 1.86 billion users who are active on Facebook each month.","Many people worry that virtual reality will lead to people neglecting their physical lives and real-world relationships. While this is a valid concern, it is not the only unintended consequence of virtual reality.

The FBI investigation commenced in April and was considering the legality of online gambling within the virtual world. The US Government prohibits most forms of online gambling.

It was unclear at the time of writing whether the FBI would take the matter further, including the possible arrest of Linden Lab directors or the prosecution of individual users.

Casinos and gambling have been a prominent part of the Second Life metaverse over the last 2-3 years.

100,"Virtual Creatures in a Box, Controlled by You","A projector inside the lid of Holus beams four images of the same object onto the walls of the prism, and to the user they appear to form a single image. Users can control the images with a smartphone connected via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. A tablet computer or laptop attached to the box runs an app that feeds images to the projector, and adjusts what you see based on input from the controller. At this year’s International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, H+ used Holus to let visitors play a multiplayer dice game controlled with an iPod Touch.

A woman gazes at a demo game for Holus, in which players must work together to defeat a monster.

In a video chat, Adhia gave me a sense of how this looks. He demonstrated characters like a woman in a sort of spacesuit and a sword- and shield-wielding skeleton, whose positions he could change by moving an iPod Touch. He said the Holus app determines the user’s perspective by tracking the controller’s motion, then adjusting in real time.

Images appeared to be visible from multiple angles, and were responsive to swipes and movements he made with the iPod. But it looked far more primitive than some other 3-D augmented-reality efforts. Microsoft unveiled a sophisticated augmented reality headset called HoloLens in January (see “Microsoft Headset Rewrites Reality with Holograms”); while Magic Leap, a startup, showed me impressive imagery when I visited the company late last year (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2015: Magic Leap”). Another company, called Leia, is developing a new optical technique that brings glasses-free holographic images to mobile gadgets (see “New Display Technology Lets LCDs Produce Princess Leia-Style Holograms”).

Michael Bove, the leader of the object-based media group at the MIT Media Lab, also noted that the H+ technology appears to be neither holographic nor actually 3-D, meaning you couldn’t walk around it and see a smooth 360-degree view of the image being projected.

H+ hopes to drum up interest by selling its device through Kickstarter this spring. It wants to convince people to shell out about $850 or $950 for their own Holus, depending on whether buyers want a “home” version or a larger one geared toward developers.","Virtual reality has been heralded as a way to transport people to other worlds and provide them with new and immersive experiences.

Why AI Home Assistants Need a Screen

You may control your home with your voice, but having it speak back is often impractical. Asking Amazon’s Alexa to play a specific song, for instance, is a joy. But if you’re not sure what to listen to, the voice-only system can feel limiting. At the same time, voice assistant apps grow in number but go unused because people simply forget about them. Speaking to the Download, Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, explained that, while a 2016 study by Stanford researchers and his own team showed that speech input is three times quicker than typing on mobile devices, “the fastest way for a machine to get information to you is via a screen.” He continued: “Say you want to order takeout. Imagine a voice that reads out: ‘Here are the top twenty restaurants in your area. Number one …’ This would be insanely slow!” No surprise, then, that Baidu has been working on a smart assistant device called Little Fish that includes a screen, and Amazon is also rumored to be developing a similar piece of hardware. The AI assistant revolution, it seems, may be televised.



Silicon Valley Fights the Immigration Ban—Cautiously

Several tech giants have now backed a legal challenge to President Trump's immigration policy, but others are still carefully mulling the ramifications of such actions. The BBC reports that Amazon, Microsoft, and Expedia have all lent support to a lawsuit filed by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson which hopes to show that the immigration ban is unconstitutional. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union has been so heavily inundated with funding—racking up $24 million since the weekend—that it’s teamed up with Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator to work out how best to use the money. But read many of the statements issued by the tech elite, and you’ll notice that they've criticized the policy but not the administration—because they're nervous about what might happen. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal (paywall), former Google executive Wesley Chan neatly framed the predicament: “The practical matter is, you’re running a company worth billions of dollars and they’re the regulators, so what choice do you have.”

102,"In One Hospital, Finding Humanity in an Inhuman Crisis","After more than three decades as a critical care nurse at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor, Carolyn Lyles has come to depend on her hour-long commute as a refuge from the din of alarming machines and harried voices that awaits her in the ICU. On a typical morning, Lyles, 55, wakes up at 4, prepares her lunch, makes coffee, and grabs a bagel for the road.

She slips out of the house while her husband Steve and three children are still in bed, climbs into her gray Buick Enclave, and drives from her home in Grosse Ile, near the point where the Detroit River spills into Lake Erie, past sleeping neighbors in darkened houses, across the Wayne County swing bridge and past the Chrysler engine plant in Trenton. As she cruises past the red approach lights that guide airliners into Detroit-Wayne County International Airport, she thinks of her 82-year-old mother, Mary, asleep nearby in the house that she grew up in. Mary, who raised Carolyn alone, was a neonatal ICU nurse. The days Lyles spent shadowing her mom at the hospital inspired her to become a nurse herself.

A deeply faithful Catholic, Lyles usually travels the dark highway in silence. She prays that God will deliver her to the patient who needs her most. Working so close to the fragile membrane between life and death, Lyles has always prayed for strength to get through the day. After two weeks of caring for Covid-19 patients, those prayers had taken on a frightening intensity.

Inside Michigan Medicine's Race to Beat Covid-19 Read the rest of the series here.

On Tuesday March 24, the 20-bed Critical Care Medicine Unit, or CCMU—the only place Lyles has ever worked since she received her nursing degree in 1987, just a year after the hospital opened—was suddenly closed and emptied of patients so that carpenters could install negative-pressure filtration systems for the anticipated deluge of Covid patients. Since Lyles and her CCMU teammates have pulmonary care expertise, they were temporarily reassigned to the Regional Infectious Containment Unit, or RICU, a special negative-pressure ward on the 12th floor of the adjacent C. S. Mott Children’s Hospital that can be activated in emergencies to isolate patients with highly infectious diseases like SARS, Ebola, and now Covid-19.

It was disorienting. “We were all blindsided,” Lyles tells me. Accustomed to working one-on-one with her patients on a floor as familiar to her as her own home, with colleagues she has known for decades and come to think of as family, Lyles was suddenly thrust into a 50-bed unit in an entirely different building, assisting a swarm of unknown doctors, nurses, and technicians swathed from head to toe in protective gear that would have made it difficult to recognize them even if she did know them. “You have no idea where anything is,” she says. “How do I get help? Who do I get help from? Where is everybody?”

Lyles did not have a patient of her own that first day in the RICU, so she served as a runner, fetching medications and supplies for nurses who were tending to patients behind glass doors that remained closed to minimize contamination. Nurses on the inside would write their orders on the glass with dry-erase markers—backwards, to make them readable to the runners—because it was impossible to communicate through N95 masks and glass and over the noise of ventilators and alarms. On the drive home that night, Lyles was exhausted, her back in spasms from the tension.

“I'm not sure I'm ready for this,” she thought to herself. “I'm really scared.”

“We are facing an unprecedented situation that none of us has lived through before. We know this is terrifying for all of us,” reads an email sent to employees of Michigan Medicine—the University of Michigan’s hospital system—on April 2, signed by CEO Marschall Runge and two other members of the executive team. By the time the email hit the inboxes of 28,000 employees—who include about 3,000 doctors, 6,000 nurses, 1,200 residents and fellows, and legions of support staff—Detroit, about 30 miles away, was reeling from an outbreak that had already filled some of the city’s largest hospitals to capacity.","The main unintended consequence of virtual reality being used more frequently is that people are becoming more isolated from one another. With people being able to immerse themselves in virtual worlds, they are spending less time interacting with the people around them in the real world.

103,Google's VR180 Cameras Are the Future of Point-and-Shoot,"Just about everyone agrees virtual and augmented reality are going to be important. The tech already sort of works, and will get better quickly from here. Gadgets offering the ability to truly feel as if you've been transported to another place, or to superimpose the digital world on the real one, will be transformative. Somehow. Eventually. For some reason. No one knows exactly what AR and VR will be good for, or when. They just know it's coming.

This week at CES, Google's partners are announcing two new cameras that support the VR180 standard, which refers to a new way of capturing 180-degree panoramic images.

Clay Bavor, the leader of Google's virtual reality team, is trying to strike a difficult balance: Bavor and his team are trying to build products that people will buy and use now, while preparing for the future, who knows how long from now, when all this world-changing stuff starts to happen. Right now, before all the tech is ready and everyone's used to it, coming up with things people want is tricky. (Just ask the folks at Oculus and Vive.) But recently, Bavor says he's found something that might be special: VR as a way to capture and relive important memories in your life.

Eyes on Eyes

This week at CES, Google's partners are announcing two new cameras that support the VR180 standard, which refers to a new way of capturing 180-degree panoramic images. Lenovo's making the Mirage Camera, designed to go along with the Mirage Solo headset, a completely wireless and self-sufficient Daydream VR headset. Yi, another Chinese manufacturer, is making a similar camera called the Horizon.

Yi's Horizon camera is another VR180 camera built in partnership with Google's virtual reality team. Google

Both are basically just point-and-shoots with two lenses on the front rather than one. They capture 4K, three-dimensional video that you can watch on YouTube, in Google Photos, or in any VR headset. They're not the highest-tech VR things you've ever seen, but they might be the easiest to understand. Which is precisely the point.

""People love going places,"" Bavor says. ""They love going places."" Google's Earth VR and Street View apps are both hugely popular among VR users, and Expeditions, a virtual field-trip platform, has proven popular in schools. It's not surprising, then, that the Google VR team has spent a lot of time thinking about how to help people capture places in VR for themselves and others to visit again later. ""But when we looked at how people use their cameras, it's very seldom that it's like, 'Let me take an aesthetically beautiful, well-composed photo,'"" Bavor says. ""It's about remembering a moment."" The photos, he says, aren't even really the point. It's about what happens when you look at them, the memories you get to re-live. And when you watch them back, the stereoscopic and super-wide footage feels so much more immersive than any photograph you've ever seen.

Bringin' Us Back

Both new VR180 cameras can livestream directly to YouTube, or save your memories to Google Photos. The Photos integration was particularly important, Bavor says, ""because we see this being such a strong product for memory capture. And memories live in your own private repository of photos until you decide otherwise."" If you want a clue of where this is all going, look at the Pensieve, the swirling store of memories that comes up repeatedly in Harry Potter. ""We've got a lot of work to do to get there fully,"" Bavor says, ""but I think there's something universal about memory and nostalgia and a desire to reflect on, step back into, be a part of, memories or experiences or time with people you care about.""

The best version of this tech, Bavor guesses, would require either tiling your walls with camera lenses, or some mythical tricorder device that recorded everything and everyone all the time. (He says both are roughly impossible, but has clearly given the idea a lot of thought.) But it's one big step in the right direction when you can take photos with a camera that sees roughly as you do---the cameras' lenses are the exact distance apart of the average person's pupils---and can faithfully display the scene in three dimensions. You can't move in it yet, but you can see it as it was.

VR180, like most things in VR right now, is the simple-but-usable version of what will someday be much cooler. It exists for a few reasons: because 360-degree video is actually really complicated to do well, because there aren't many great ways to watch 360 video, and because even when they do watch super-immersive footage, viewers don't tend to look around much. With VR180, your camera can look and operate more like a regular point-and-shoot, and viewers get a similarly immersive feel without having to constantly spin around.","Perhaps the most unintended consequence of virtual reality is its potential to create a disconnect between people and the world around them. While VR can provide amazing experiences and the ability to connect with others in new ways, there is also the potential for people to use VR as a way to escape from the everyday world. This could lead to people becoming less connected with the real world and more reliant on the virtual world for social interaction and entertainment.",https://www.wired.com/story/google-vr180-cameras-from-lenovo-and-yi/,2018-01-09 19:15:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.948515772819519,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
104,The Man Selling Virtual Reality to China,"Consumer demand seems strong. China’s virtual-reality market will reach over $7.9 billion (55 billion yuan) in 2020, according to the China Electronics Standardization Institute, a research agency under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which has the authority to set the standards for the VR industry.

China has already become the fastest-growing film market in the world, with box office revenues reaching $6.3 billion (44 billion yuan) in 2015, according to Deloitte. That’s big enough to support feature films in a serious way, says Geiger, and one reason he has reopened the independent studio, Magic Dumpling, that he started with a couple of Chinese partners in 2009. While some touchy political topics will be off limits, Geiger says his goal is to create virtual-reality entertainment that looks at what’s going on in society and gives audiences something to think about, an alternative for Chinese filmgoers weary of the current cinematic diet of dry historical dramas.

Geiger and his partners at Magic Dumpling have created animated characters inspired by Chinese culture. These include Tofu Boy, a mischievous child who changes mood and texture as his mood swings, and two smiling stone lions, called Stoney and Rocky, both projects which were bought by Disney in 2012, when Geiger joined the company to lead its creative team in China. (He left that role in 2015.)

An Ohioan with an easygoing manner, Geiger has a history of cleverly adapting to technological change. Shortly after he graduated from college as a painting major, Geiger realized computer-generated imagery had begun to take over hand-drawn animation, so he learned how to program. Working at Walt Disney Feature Animation in California from 1995 to 2007, he helped to create films including Fantasia 2000 and Dinosaur and later became the computer graphics supervisor for Chicken Little, the studio’s first full 3-D animated feature.

Based in China since 2008, when he accepted an invitation to teach at the Beijing Film Academy’s animation school, Geiger sees a parallel between his own life and one of the storylines common in many films, that of a character who unexpectedly is pulled toward a new fate. In his case, he says, watching VR so quickly take off in China has been the catalyst for a longer stay in China, and another career adaptation.

That rapid rate of consumer adoption gives Geiger a better opportunity to push VR in interesting directions in China than he would have in the U.S. where adoption has been slower, says Eric Hanson, who teaches at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, and develops VR content at xRez Studio in California.

To kick-start the Film Academy’s new VR center, Geiger has proposed a number of projects aimed at taking advantage of VR’s ability to situate its audience directly in the story. With the VR audience no longer staring in one direction the entire time, as it does in traditional cinema, filmmakers must figure out how to tell a story even when a viewer might be looking in the opposite direction of where the action is taking place. Geiger’s solution is to allow people to explore the film, but to structure a way to pull them back to common experiences at key points in the story, moments every viewer must experience before going on.

One of his first projects is a planned VR short film called Four Dishes and a Soup. Its simple storyline — a foreigner having dinner with his Chinese girlfriend’s family — provides a way to discuss Chinese concerns about accommodating foreign culture while maintaining a sense of unity. Early in 2017, before writing the script, he will have the actors actually have dinner in a Chinese family setting and record the improvisation among them from the foreigner’s point of view using a stereoscopic camera.

Other planned projects are more traditional in their subject matter, such as one that will create a virtual-reality experience that allows foreign museumgoers to walk amid the ranks of China’s Terracotta Army and learn its story.

In his work in China, Geiger has focused on sharing his professional know-how, being careful not to impose his Western philosophy on his interactions with Chinese colleagues.

And there are cultural differences he has found one needs to be sensitive to that will impact his VR work as well. Whereas a Western screenwriter might (as Calder Willingham and Buck Henry did in The Graduate) have the hero express his love by bursting into the church when the heroine is about to marry another man and declaring his love in front of a roomful of strangers, a Chinese screenwriter would have the hero challenge the man who’s about to marry the heroine but never tell her his true feelings.

There are business differences, too. The Western convention is to take out insurance to compensate investors if a film is not completed, but Chinese producers see this as unnecessary, says Geiger.

The earliest examples of VR being completed in China are not full-length films but short, business-oriented pieces like advertisements and promotion videos.

VR arcades are already doing brisk business offering shooting games and short videos for around $7 (50 yuan) per person. These could become a place to roll out exploratory content, says Eric Shamlin, executive producer of Secret Location, a studio based in Toronto and Los Angeles that won a 2015 Emmy for a VR experience it created, and who has traveled to China to explore potential partnerships.

It will take some time before a true VR blockbuster sweeps the movie world in China, in part because finding investors willing to take a chance on virtual-reality movie projects is difficult, but also because filmmakers are still searching for their narrative language, says Eddie Lou, the founder of Sandman Studios, a Beijing-based startup creating VR animated features. “Everybody is testing,” says Lou. “But it’s a very thrilling process.”","The potential for addiction.

105,VR is the US Olympic ski team’s secret weapon,"Virtual-reality job training has found a rather extreme new application: preparing Olympic skiers for the slopes.

The setup: In early 2017, Strivr, the same firm that produces Walmart’s VR training systems, built a program for the team. To create it, Strivr put a 360-degree camera on top of athletes’ helmets and had them ski down Olympic courses.

(Kinda) carving the slopes: The system acts like 360-degree videos on YouTube. It responds to head rotation but doesn’t allow the user to move freely within the virtual environment. It is, however, paired with the SkyTechSport Simulator—an indoor machine that provides force feedback to the skiers.

Mental advantage: Athletes that have used the system feel as though they’ve skied down the courses in Pyeongchang, South Korea, many times before even arriving at the competition. It’s also allowed preparation to continue even when athletes are injured. We’ll have to wait and see if it works.

106,Virtual Reality Won't Just Amuse—It Will Heal Millions,"The plane already was convulsing by the time the ""please fasten seatbelt"" sign came on. Dark, foreboding clouds filled the sky. We must have been flying right into a storm. All I could think of was that opening scene in Lost where the plane splits in half.

We rode out the turbulence and made an uneventful landing. As the plane came to a stop on the tarmac, I pulled off my goggles, and the virtual world of the cabin disappeared. I was in a conference room in the offices of River, a startup incubator in San Francisco's SoMa district, miles from the airport.

River was launched earlier this year by venture capital Rothenberg Ventures with the goal of advancing the state of virtual reality by providing VR startups with office space plus $100,000 in seed funding. In those offices you'll find hardware hackers working on a new VR headsets and 3D cameras, filmmakers creating lush, interactive digital movies, and developers building the ""Ticketmaster for VR events."" But most importantly, you'll find VR designers hard at work helping people solve real-world problems today.

And not just ""problems"" in the sense that too many startups mean as they try to monetize a solution to a minor inconvenience. For years, virtual reality has made inroads in helping to treat serious phobias, post-traumatic stress, and burn victims' pain. Now, as the price of VR tech plummets, this therapeutic tech is advancing---and could soon become available to many more people who need it.

More Than Entertainment

Since Facebook acquired VR company Oculus last year, we've heard a lot about the potential for virtual reality to transform the economy by revitalizing consumer entertainment, social media, shopping, education, and travel. We've speculated about what the killer app for VR might be, or whether it even needs one. Less has been said about the progress VR has already made as a tool for healing. In fields like pain management, physical rehabilitation and the treatment of anxiety disorders such as post traumatic stress, VR is coming into its own. And thanks to the recent emergence of affordable consumer VR rigs like Samsung Gear VR, patients may finally be able to take advantage of technology that's been inaccessible to the larger public for two decades.

Psious

For example, the airline simulation I experienced---created by River company Psious---is a virtual reality version of exposure therapy, an approach to treating anxiety disorders such as phobias and post traumatic stress disorder. The idea is to gradually expose someone to the source of their anxiety---flying, for example---in a safe setting in a way that enables them to face that fear in the real world later. The company offers several other simulators, including ones to help with arachnophobia, fear of needles, claustrophobia, and public speaking.

The simulations aren't perfectly immersive---it's obvious you're in a computer-generated world when wearing a headset---but studies have found VR to be more effective at treating some phobias than traditional exposure methods like mental visualization or photographs. The problem is that historically, VR systems have cost tens of thousands of dollars, making such therapy available to a small percentage of people. Psious, however, is now able to sell a bundle of hardware---including a Homido headset, a smart phone and a haptic feedback device---for $300. ""We haven't invented anything,"" Psious co-founder Dani Roig acknowledges. ""We just democratized these kind of treatments.""

VR Never Went Away

The conventional wisdom is that VR was vastly overhyped in the 1980s and 90s, and after a few disappointments like Nintendo's Virtual Boy, quietly disappeared until 2012 when Oculus began demoing its Rift headset. But the thing is, virtual reality never really went away.

Just ask Howard Rose, who has spent the past 20 years building virtual worlds for medical researchers. In the mid-1990s, his company Firsthand helped the University of Washington design SpiderWorld, an application for treating arachnophobia. Later the company built Attack of the S. Mutans!, a game designed to help children develop better toothbrushing habits, and IraqWorld, a game designed to help treat PTSD.

But the company's most important project may be SnowWorld, a first-person action game designed to help burn victims manage their pain designed in conjunction with University of Washington researchers led by Hunter Hoffman. Researchers have been using the game to help distract patients from their pain for years. Now Rose and Firsthand co-founder Ari Hollander are now focusing strictly on pain management with their new River-backed startup Deepstream VR.","Virtual reality technology is becoming increasingly affordable, which means that more people will have access to it. This could have a number of unintended consequences, including the possibility that people will use it to escape from their problems instead of facing them. Additionally, as VR becomes more realistic, there is a risk that people will become addicted to it and lose touch with reality.",https://www.wired.com/2015/03/virtual-reality-wont-just-amuse-will-heal-millions/,2015-03-05 12:00:48+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9926552772521972,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
107,The pandemic has probably killed VR arcades for good,"A lagging trend of the past few months has been witnessing startups that COVID-19 seemed poised to kill end up scaling back some of those deep cuts and taking off again. Not all spaces have been quite so lucky; in particular, lately we’ve seen a host of location-based virtual reality startups shut their doors.

Virtual reality arcades weren’t exactly crushing it pre-pandemic; the small industry was already a bit of a Hail Mary for the virtual reality market, which has failed to push consumers to adopt headsets on their own and saw arcades as a way to warm up the general public to VR’s role in entertainment. Lackluster consumer interest and the throughput difficulties associated with quickly moving users through experiences were among the biggest challenges facing VR arcades.

This week, following a report from Protocol, Apple confirmed its acquisition of Spaces, a virtual reality arcade startup that had been forced to close its in-person arcades amid COVID-19 and had attempted a pivot to creating virtual environments for video chat software. An Apple acquisition is hardly a mark of failure, but it is unlikely that the company has any interest in reviving the startup’s arcade business.

Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. subsidiary of Sandbox VR had filed for bankruptcy. Sandbox VR has raised quite a bit of money on the promise that they could revamp several industries at once. The idea was that mall operators on the decline would give great deals to some of these startups to set up physical storefronts as a loss leader to bring in a younger generation of consumers, while they could capitalize on mixed reality social media video to bring a level of viral growth to their VR offerings.

In July, UploadVR discovered documents that suggested Disney had terminated the lease of virtual reality startup The Void’s Downtown Disney location following months of COVID-19-related closures.

It was impossible to forecast the current pandemic when many of these investments were being made, but virtual reality arcades had already shown they were far from a sure bet. In late 2018, IMAX shut the doors of the last of its seven virtual reality arcades after investing tens of millions into its VR efforts.

With the future of in-person entertainment unclear, the question is whether virtual reality arcades have any chance of a rebound.

The fact is many of these startups were pushing up against current realities on multiple fronts and were attempting to seriously shift the landscape of 21st century digital entertainment, attempts that seemed daunting from the start.

As massive movie theater chains struggle to see how the pandemic will affect their industries in the long-term, it isn’t surprising that many of these startups have failed to see a light at the end of the tunnel and have shut down operations or been sold off. I suspect investors will be reluctant to back new efforts in this space and that the time horizon of COVID-19 will force current entrants toward pivots that look dramatically different from pre-COVID-19-era business models. (One caveat is that the VR arcade market certainly looks different in the United States compared to markets in countries like China and Japan where virtual reality arcades seem to fit a bit more snugly into popular gaming culture.)

If VR arcades survive or are reborn, it will be due to some pretty massive shifts in consumer behavior and VR adoption.

Virtual reality, as an industry, is in a tough spot. In the United States, it’s essentially only Facebook keeping the space alive in a meaningful way, and the company seems to be barreling ahead in its efforts to build a mainstream future for the technology on its own terms. Earlier this summer, Facebook announced that it was pulling its top-selling title Beat Saber from arcades for good by August. Since the acquisition of Oculus back in 2014, the ecosystem that sprang up around Facebook’s VR efforts has receded meaningfully, leaving the company in a lonely position once again.","It has led to the demise of many virtual reality arcades. These arcades were created with the intention of bringing VR to the masses, but they have failed to do so due to a variety of factors. The biggest factor is likely the lack of interest from consumers. VR arcades require a high level of investment, and they have not been able to generate enough revenue to justify their existence. The other factor is the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of these arcades to close their doors, and it is unclear if they will be able to reopen.",https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/the-pandemic-has-probably-killed-vr-arcades-for-good/,2020-08-25 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9953625202178956,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,TechCrunch,Economy
108,Virtual Reality Users Keep Suffering Horrible Injuries,"Image by Getty Images/Futurism Devices

To the shock of no one, more people are getting injured using virtual reality headsets than ever before — because, well, more people are buying them than ever before.

As The Wall Street Journal reports, the growing popularity of VR headsets has had the all-too-predictable side effect of people hurting themselves because they can’t see where they’re stepping, punching, or kicking when in gameplay.

While video game injuries are far from new — remember how often people got hurt playing Wii when it first came out? — VR presents a very specific category of risk because you literally cannot see your surrounding while wearing it. Moreover, VR’s selling point also presents major safety hazards: the immersive, interactive games that require you to stand up and move around, which is not dissimilar to actually undertaking strenuous physical activity.

That exact scenario happened to North Carolinian Jake Masters, who told the WSJ that last year he dislocated his shoulder and needed physical therapy while “fighting” in a virtual coliseum. What’s more: Masters had injured the same shoulder in an IRL boxing match years earlier, and although he wasn’t “supposed to do real boxing after the first injury,” he thought playing the VR game would be alright because it wasn’t real.

“Next time I’ll just let the tiger eat me,” Masters, who has had to have months of physical therapy to deal with the injury, told the paper.

While the WSJ details a number of other injuries sustained by VR gamers from falling over or coming into contact with solid objects while gaming, not all of the accidents are the result of onetime mishaps, either.

Last year, the Journal of Medical Case Reports published a study about an otherwise 31-year-old German man who broke his neck while playing a VR game that involved “a combination of shoulder, arm and head movements while wearing a VR headset.” He came into a clinic while suffering pain in his neck and it was there that doctors discovered he had a traumatic fracture at the nape of his neck that they determined was caused by the “intense” and “repetitive” motions he made during the unidentified game.

The WSJ also noted a cumulative injury some are calling “gorilla arm syndrome,” which Oregon State University Associate Professor Jay Kim told the newspaper is what results when people keep their arms raised — you know, gorilla-style — for long periods of time without taking breaks.

While many VR headsets come with instructions that suggest clearing out furniture and taking breaks, and more recently have updated the in-headset grids to give users alerts when objects, people, or pets approach them, it’s not hard to imagine users ignoring these sorts of features when they’re in intense gameplay.

Take, for example, the story of Taylor Murray, who first cut himself playing virtual boxing and then broke a vase weeks later playing virtual tennis — much to the chagrin of his wife Lauren, who told the WSJ that she no longer thinks VR is a good way for her husband to workout.

“Why don’t you go to the gym like a normal person?” she bemoaned.

Her husband, meanwhile, has a different take: “I’m sure I’ll make the same mistake again.”

With a market value estimated to in the hundreds of billions and growing steadily, VR is, without a doubt, here to stay — and it seems like its associated injuries will just keep piling up, too.

109,Free Guy Sees the Metaverse Through Rose-Colored Glasses,"Ryan Reynolds’ new movie, Free Guy, isn’t what you’d call light on schtick. It’s a film about a non-player character (NPC) in a video game, after all. But the first and most prevalent gimmick is the sunglasses. In Free City, the fictitious shooter game at the center of the story, sunglasses are what signify a player: someone who can shoot up a bank, steal a car, face-punch a stranger. They are, Guy (Reynolds) says, the “heroes.” Similar to the shades in the movie They Live, the players' eyewear works like in-game augmented reality specs, showing scores, power-ups, loot, etc. Sunglasses are the lens through which players are meant to experience Free City’s metaverse and decode its mysteries.

(Spoiler alert: Minor spoilers for Free Guy follow.)

Those shades are rose-colored. Guy, the audience eventually learns, is more than just an NPC in Free City—he’s actually an artificially intelligent bit of code left there by the game’s original developers, and he is just starting to gain sentience. When he pilfers his own pair of shades, the scales fall from his eyes and he sees his world the way players do. The twist, though, is that he doesn’t try to kill his human overlords; he just tries to make his world a more hospitable environment, one without daily shootings or robberies, where nothing blows up and the trolls don’t rule. More than artificially intelligent, he’s artificially empathetic. “The AI is taking us toward a more utopian kind of togetherness, this idea of agency and uniting, and creating agents of change,” Reynolds told WIRED in a recent interview. “I loved that idea. That it wasn’t Terminator or something. That Guy becomes sentient in an open world, a quite hostile video game.”

To be clear, Free City is not technically a metaverse; the film’s at-home gamers don't play it in virtual reality headsets. If anything, the game is a stand-in for what it's like to be Very Online: fun, but there’s danger around every corner. For Guy, an NPC, Free City is the whole world; it's as if he lives in a metaverse but has no offline counterpart. When he gets his sunglasses, he realizes that can be a world without violence, a place where trash talk isn’t incentivized. (One of the film’s more poignant running themes: The game's original devs were building an online utopia, but the corporation that bought it believed no one wanted to play such a thing, so it became a shooter.) Guy’s sentience comes with a mission to stop crime and right wrongs. Gamers streaming his antics transform him into a viral savior and question their own digital bloodlust. Guy’s vision of a nice place awash in Mariah Carey ( … sweet, sweet fantasy, baby/when I close my eyes you come and you take me …) feels possible. Nice dream.

It's here that Free Guy's virtual world diverges too much from the real one, and its (applaudable) optimism goes too far. Its video game environment and the culture around it (Twitch streamers, cocky gaming CEOs, overworked developers) appear painfully real, prescient even. Its main character doesn't. As an Everyman who can deliver a joke, there's no one better than Reynolds, but as an AI, Guy doesn't work. Not to get overly literal, but artificial intelligence is molded from received data. If Guy had indeed been living and learning in a world populated by violent trolls, he would likely have absorbed their ways. At best he would have picked up off-color jokes; at worst he would have ended up like Tay, that Microsoft Twitter chatbot that needed only 12 hours online to turn into a “foul-mouthed racist Holocaust denier.” And frankly, that’s likely not the worst. Free Guy contends that having a world of gamers, and internet fans, reevaluate how they think about an NPC could cause them to reevaluate how they see each other; maybe, just maybe, everyone could see the people they meet in virtual worlds as people. It might be the movie's best gag.

The thing about the internet and the metaverse is that they are one and the same, and yet one operates as a fully realized part of daily life and the other, while currently a buzzword, remains in its infancy. Unlike the dystopian vision Neal Stephenson had in Snow Crash, the conception of the metaverse today—the one Mark Zuckerberg wants Facebook to build—is a virtual and augmented reality full of human connections where people work, work out, play, and make stuff. It’s a place for NFT art and Ariana Grande concerts in Fortnite, where your headset tells you fun facts about the things you’re looking at. Uglier versions exist, too, but many modern hopes for the metaverse seem enmeshed in concepts similar to the OASIS in Ernie Cline’s Ready Player One. The internet, meanwhile, the bridge to the metaverse, is guarded by trolls and full of misinformation, hate, misogyny. At its most dire, it is a place where the thinly veiled dark side of every person is left free to roam and wreak havoc. The internet and the metaverse may exist on the same network, but they often exist on very different planes. Free Guy, it seems, wants to argue that out of the primordial ooze of the internet, a better virtual world could emerge, with the help of an AI made in the muck.

Honestly, this isn’t even really a flaw of Free Guy, or something that’s the fault of Reynolds or director Shawn Levy. Optimism needs its champions, and making popular art celebrating it can't hurt. But optimism is often a symptom of privilege. Zuckerberg can be confident in the power of algorithms; algorithms have been good to him, less so for people wrongly sent to jail by facial-recognition systems or misdiagnosed by an AI. It’s ironic, or perhaps simply unfortunate, that Free Guy features both a female developer fighting to reclaim her code and an in-game worker strike, when just last month Activision Blizzard employees staged a walkout over allegations of rampant sexism. If anything, Free Guy, and Free City, are mirror worlds—a look at what’s gone wrong with the internet and gamer culture, through the eyes of people who want to fix them.",People might become more disconnected from each other in real life.,https://www.wired.com/story/free-guy-ai-metaverse-review/,2021-08-13 11:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9933706521987916,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
110,8i Raises $13.5M To Chase The Human Side Of Virtual Reality,"There I stood, about a foot away from a mother and her newborn baby. The mother was talking to her daughter in a video captured in virtual reality for the child to see one day when she’s older. It was realistic. Almost scarily so. I was able to walk around a “room” and watch the mother speaking from every angle, including behind her.

I’ve never seen that much human detail with a VR getup on my face.

The really trippy part? The company shot followup footage a few weeks later and seeing the child “grow” with my own eyes was nuts.

That is 8i’s speciality and the New Zealand / Los Angeles / San Francisco based firm has announced a $13.5 million Series A round with participation from an interesting mix of investors to make VR more human: RRE Ventures, Founders Fund Science, Horizons Ventures, Samsung Ventures, Dolby Family Ventures, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, Sound Ventures, Signia Venture Partners, Inevitable Ventures, Freelands and Advancit Capital, Kevin Wall, Jeremy Stoppelman, John and Andrew Hendricks, End Cue and Kortschak Investments, Rothenberg Ventures and Boost VC.

8i is building a platform so that content creators can make their own 3D renderings and VR experiences available in anything from a dating app to a feature film. The 360-degree stuff is a nut that 8i cracked and it’s no wonder that there is a lot of interest around them. I mean, Samsung Ventures’ and Dolby’s involvement speaks volumes. The company is also opening a studio in Los Angeles that they plan on letting content creators use for free. The more creativity that flows around the technology, the better it can get.

“We’re focusing on a really hard problem, to bring humans into augmented realities,” 8i CEO Linc Gasking told me.

To focus on the humanity aspect was important for Gasking and his team of 27 (and growing), who come from companies like Pixar, DreamWorks, YouTube, Industrial Light & Magic, PayPal, Microsoft Research, Sony Computer Entertainment, Digital Domain, NVIDIA, Weta Digital and Valve.

“I didn’t want to do games. I wanted that human connection. I wanted to tell stories and connect with people in a three dimensional way.” Gasking told me of the 8i platform. Going beyond games is music to my ears, as well as the ears of investors.

But when is real too real? I’ve heard stories of people jumping into VR and what they see becomes so real to them that they react physically. Shoot, during one of 8i’s demos I was standing on a “cliff” and Gasking urged me to jump off. I didn’t, even though the entire thing was a mirage.

The key to keeping it safe, though, is one of Gasking’s core rules when developing these scenarios, which he tells me is “respect.” Respecting regular human boundaries is key to building a human-friendly world in VR, he tells me.

At the end of the day, 8i’s goal is to be an agnostic platform across AR, VR and the web. As far as mother in child standing before me? You can go check out the web demo later, but you really have to be in VR to “get it.”",People may become so immersed in virtual reality that they forget about the real world.,https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/8i-raises-13-5m-to-chase-the-human-side-of-virtual-reality/,2015-10-14 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9952025413513184,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,TechCrunch,User Experience & Entertainment
111,I Expect You to Die Is the Most Fun I've Ever Had in VR,"Escape room games, in which a team of players are locked in a real-life room full of puzzles and secrets and have to solve the clues to get out, are a favorite pastime of mine. I Expect You to Die is one of the first VR games to attempt to recreate these thrills in a virtual environment—and if your tastes are anything like mine, it's a hell of a lot of fun.

Available December 6 for Oculus Rift and December 13 for PlayStation VR, I Expect You to Die puts you in the role of a secret agent attempting to thwart the latest evil plot of a cartoon villain, but who instead ends up in a potentially deadly situation that must be escaped with brainpower alone. While you can play this first-person, seated game using a standard gamepad or a PC mouse, I'd really, really recommend you use the Oculus Touch controllers (like I did) or PlayStation Move motion controllers, because to do otherwise would give up much of what makes the game immersive and fun. Manipulating objects with ""your hands"" is the key to good times.

In the game's first scenario, you're trapped inside a car that's trapped inside an airplane's cargo bay. Your mission: Drive the car off the plane. It shouldn't take you too long to find the key, insert it into the ignition, and give it a turn. Of course, this simply activates a self-defense laser in the sunshade above you that will blast your head off if you don't figure out how to avoid or disable it.

Schell Games

The likely scenario here is that you'll just get your head blown off and have to start over. As you should probably expect from a game with a title like this one's, dying is a constant. But the idea is that once you learn the solutions to the puzzles, you'll be able to very swiftly get back to where you were. A puzzle that takes you half an hour of noodling to solve generally only takes a couple of seconds to solve again once you know it. Safe combinations don't change from playthrough to playthrough, so you can, for example, skip the whole step where you learned the combo by counting the holes in a piece of Swiss cheese. (This is not a real puzzle.)

Importantly, you also have telekinetic powers. All this means is that you're not limited to what you can grab with your actual arms. You can pull things toward you (or manipulate levers, knobs, et cetera from across the room), or send things away from you. You also have the very useful ability to make objects float, so if you find any sort of data or charts you might need to reference, you can just stick them anywhere. The air around you is your personal invisible corkboard, basically.","The main unintended consequence of virtual reality, as discussed in the article, is that it can be used to escape from reality. This is because VR can be used to create immersive environments that are very different from the real world. This can be a problem if people use VR to escape from their problems, instead of dealing with them.",https://www.wired.com/2016/12/i-expect-you-to-die-review/,2016-12-05 15:00:09+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9855406880378724,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
112,The Inside Story of How Oculus Cracked the Impossible Design of VR,"Palmer Luckey has never used an Oculus Rift.

That’s what the founder of Oculus keeps telling himself as he unboxes the commercial version of the virtual reality system he invented. Opens the package. Takes out the few elements—the headset, the single cable that connects it to a computer, the small cylindrical infrared camera that tracks it in space. Runs through the setup. And finally puts on the headset and takes stock of his surroundings.

Luckey has been doing this same thing over and over and over again, on different computers in different rooms on Facebook’s campus. He’s spent days repeating the sequence, putting himself in the shoes of a customer who has just received a Rift.

That customer could be anyone. Maybe it’s one of the hundreds of thousands of people who bought a developer-only iteration—the Kickstarted version in 2012 or maybe the more refined one that followed two years later. Maybe it’s someone who has spent the last few years with their nose pressed against the digital glass, following every wrinkle of the Rift’s progress on Reddit or podcasts or YouTube or in WIRED or even Oculus’ own lengthy, surprisingly transparent blog posts. Maybe it’s someone who experienced VR only recently, at SXSW or Sundance, and felt in their very marrow that the world was about to change.

Really, though, it doesn’t matter. After nearly four years of work, Luckey and his colleagues are about to share their long-gestating dream with the world. The Oculus Rift arrives tomorrow, and anyone who finds one on their doorstep must have an absolutely seamless experience. With all the momentum that VR has right now—the millions of people who are aware of it, the billions of dollars poured into it—Luckey would hate to see it stall because of something as pedestrian as a long wait for a driver update. So he opens a box, and he sets up a headset, and then he does it all over again. Because Palmer Luckey has never used an Oculus Rift.

The road to the Rift was paved with good design thinking. We take you through a selection of industrial prototypes to explain some of Oculus’ key decisions.

When you set out to create a virtual reality headset, you soon realize that the idea of form following function is bullshit. It’s a reductive canard. Yes, both of those things matter, and the Oculus Rift does need to be both beautiful and powerful, but it’s not something you hold in your hand—it’s something you put on your face. That’s a daunting prospect: Not only are you blind to the world around you, but there’s the whole I-look-nuts thing. (There’s also the whole here-comes-Skynet thing, but on that front we’ve got bigger, Go-playing fish to fry.)

That’s only part of it, though; once you put it on your face, it needs to disappear. It needs to be not just comfortable but light—or at least feel light. After all, it’s less of a window than it is a wormhole; the more you remember it’s there, the less you’re able to lose yourself in everything happening inside it. (And what’s happening inside it is a whole other challenge, one we’ll get to later.)",It makes people look foolish.,https://www.wired.com/2016/03/oculus-design-virtual-reality/,2016-03-28 00:00:35+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9957720637321472,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
113,UPS is developing virtual reality tech to train its drivers,"UPS drivers preparing to get behind the wheel will soon be using virtual reality to do so.

The company’s new VR training program will be rolling out next month at nine of the company’s training facilities, simulating some of the uncertainties and challenges of delivering packages on city streets. Trainees will interact with the content using voice commands to identify obstacles while wearing headsets.

“Virtual Reality offers a big technological leap in the realm of driver safety training,” said UPS exec Juan Perez in a statement. “VR creates a hyper-realistic streetscape that will dazzle even the youngest of our drivers whose previous exposure to the technology was through video games.”

While companies like Walmart have signed onto programs with enterprise-focused startups like Strivr Labs, UPS will be building its training materials in-house.

Virtual reality may be a more immersive technology but, when done poorly, training videos can be just as unbearable as more traditional instructional materials. The big issue right now is that making custom, realistic VR content able to take advantage of everything the medium has to offer really isn’t worth the effort.

Enterprise software companies could build (and some have) game engine-rendered content that allows you to move around and interact with the environment, but they often end up with dumpy PlayStation 1 graphics that wander too far from the real-world. Largely for this reason, most companies are opting for more realistic — but less interactive — 360 video.

While VR may not be as revolutionary as, say, drones to a company that ships packages across the globe, it can still be an effective tool for getting prospective employees ready before they get out on the job. It’s also important because UPS drivers are a clear candidate for utilizing AR headsets in the future to more easily keep track of shipments hands-free while preparing for drop-offs and pick-ups.","It may lead to more accidents. This is because trainees will not be able to see the real world obstacles while they are training in VR, which could lead to them not being able to avoid them when they are driving in the real world.",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/ups-is-developing-virtual-reality-tech-to-train-its-drivers/,2017-08-15 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9941682815551758,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,TechCrunch,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
114,Reggie Watts' VR Project Is as Hilariously Bizarre as You'd Expect,"Reggie Watts is getting into virtual reality. (Who isn’t?) But when you’re dealing with a polymath like him, it’s really more like virtual surreality. (Yes, I typed that. Sorry, not sorry.)

The musician-comic's VR project, *Waves—*cue the Kanye outrage!—is a head-trip about doing VR in VR and joining a cult. Really, that’s about as much of it as can be described in words. (At least words that currently exist.) There are also pretty colors. And Nathalie Emmanuel, aka Missandei on Game of Thrones, is in it. But none of that is what makes this important. What makes this important is Waves is one the first VR projects to offer a glimpse into what humor will look like in VR, where nuance is even more necessary than it is for comedy IRL.

Thankfully, the intrinsically distraction-free nature of the medium helps matters. There are no rowdy audience members; your roommate isn't talking over jokes you're trying to hear. “You can make offhanded comments, and you know that the viewer is going to experience it,” Watts says over brunch at the Sundance Film Festival. “I know I have the freedom to be as subtle as I want, and that actually only benefits the outcome.”

The outcome in the case of Waves, which mixes live-action and animation, is something that deploys deadpan humor in some remarkable ways. “The whole world we’ve created with Waves is so big and so over-the-top,” Emmanuel says, “that to have us be very calm about it is kind of funny.”

It's also something we haven't seen a lot of in virtual reality filmmaking, which—although there have have been comedy offerings—has tended to lean toward more sober fare.

The idea to mix big, bold visuals with slow, sly comedy originated, naturally, with weed. A few months back, VR startup Wevr was looking for new people to bring into the medium. It reached out to director Benjamin Dickinson about creating something, perhaps a music video, since he’d done those before. Dickinson didn’t think a straight-up video was the way to go, but figured it would be a good idea to bring on a musically-minded person. He contacted Watts, the current band leader of The Late Late Show with James Corden and a collaborator on his recent film Creative Control. They got stoned, got lunch, and started to brainstorm.

The first thing that we talked about that made us laugh hysterically was that once you get inside the VR piece you have to put another VR helmet on. That’s so dumb! director Benjamin Dickinson

They spent two hours at that lunch, with Dickinson’s phone recording the entire conversation. The director went home, transcribed the voice memo, and had something that could pass a working script. That meeting provided some of Waves’ best ideas and funniest gags. “I think the first thing that we talked about that made us laugh hysterically was that once you get inside the VR piece you have to put another VR helmet on,” Dickinson says. “That’s so dumb!”

Dumb, yes, but also smart. And Wevr needed them to get as weird as possible. The California startup, which hopes to be a player and platform for VR creators to share their work, wanted Watts and Dickinson’s project to push the limits of what its technology could do. “We had to have them push the creativity to the edge so that our technology could meet them there,” says Wevr co-founder Anthony Batt.

But meet them where, exactly? All this talk of cults and rainbows and deadpan jokes might make Waves sound like just a VR stunt. It’s not.

“The themes in Waves are actually serious ideas. Like destroying the god-head that we’ve been culturally programmed to worship is something that Reggie and I believe in and are actively trying to do,” Dickinson says. “But we just presented it in the dumbest fucking way possible.”",The rise of virtual reality will lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and an increase in social isolation.,https://www.wired.com/2016/01/reggie-watts-comedy-vr/,2016-01-29 14:00:28+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.984454333782196,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
115,Has Holography Died Aborning?,"Many of us believed holography was that inevitable development. Yet no version of it, no matter how engaging, ever actually filled anything one could describe as a cultural need. Moreover, the technology remained cumbersome and esoteric, so the number of people with hands-on experience never expanded. And though a range of notable contemporary artists experimented with it, several of them-like Richard Kostelanetz-at some length, the medium failed to draw enough dedicated practitioners to achieve critical mass. Consequently, though many museums own a hologram or two, most people today know holography from credit cards, the occasional National Geographiccover or postage stamp, or else museum-shop paperweights and other tchotchkes rendering hokey still-lifes of skulls and watch gears.

In 1992, the Museum of Holography in New York City’s SoHo closed its doors, due to lack of interest and shortage of funds. The museum’s collection was preserved, but, though it’s conceivable that some future generation may revive holography as an archaized, estheticized practice, it’s hard to imagine anyone

deciding to inaugurate a new institution devoted to this medium. So holography may end up as a curiosity from picturemaking’s past-without a genuine heyday of its own, a quirky production method for illusionistic artifacts replaced by some lens-based version of virtual reality. Or it may prove to be the true precursor

of the 3-D imaging systems envisioned in our sci-fi, the conceptual steppingstone between analog photography and its electronic descendants.

These are not mutually exclusive options. But whichever way it goes, the work of Harriet Casdin-Silver will require acknowledgment. For, even if holography turns out to be a technological sidetrack, she has produced a durable body of work. A recent retrospective of Casdin-Silver’s holograms at the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Mass., demonstrated that this medium, though difficult, nonetheless permits the artist to move through a complex technology into the poetics of space; it made me wish that more artists had chosen to exploit holography’s potential.

For while more than a few artists have tried their hands at making a hologram or two, Casdin-Silver has made a life’s work of it, and much of her success comes from the thinking in this form that resulted from such immersion. Not that she’s a strict formalist; this work deals directly and recurrently with issues of gender, aging and sexuality, sometimes all at once. Its technological uniqueness appears not only to entrance audiences but also allow them to engage with these controversial issues. On two different occasions at the DeCordova, I watched museum-goers meet this 73-year-old grandmother’s larger-than-life-sized, unabashedly erotic nude self-portrait, “70+1+2,” on its own terms: with humor, excitement and joy. Casdin-Silver’s work does not hide behind the complexity of its execution; instead, it uses its fascinating form to engage the viewer with its content.

This piece, and the exhibition designed around it, made thoughtful use of the DeCordova’s versatile spaces. The show included a few of Casdin-Silver’s early paintings and graphics, as well as several mixed-media pieces and a reconstruction of her pre-holography 1968 installation, “Exhaust.”What these make clear is that once this artist embraced technology, she never looked back.Her holograms, mixedmedia installations incorporating holograms, and combinations of holograms with photographs consider the body and engage the senses, operating at the intersection between photography and sculpture. Some as yet undiscovered medium is bound to operate at this boundary. Whenever it does, Casdin-Silver’s germinal body of work will demand acknowledgment. Perhaps holography’s most enduring legacy will prove to be that it served at least one serious artist as a primary vehicle while anticipating the form that will eventually fulfill what holography only promised.","It may end up replacing holography as the primary means of 3-D imaging. While holography has been around for longer and has been used by artists to create illusionistic artifacts, virtual reality is more accessible and easier to use. As a result, holography may become a curiosity from picturemaking’s past, without a genuine heyday of its own.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2000/01/01/275777/has-holography-died-aborning/,2000-01-01 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9952375888824464,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,"Information, Discourse & Governance"

Every choice feels kinda wrong—even though you’re just seeing all this in a virtual-reality headset.

The discomfort is the point, says Morgan Mercer, founder of Vantage Point, the company behind the VR demonstration. Traditionally, on-the-job harassment training has been a choice between the lesser of two borings—schlocky video or snoozy slide deck—but Mercer wants to put you in the room.

She’s a survivor of sexual violence herself; she knows the subject can be hard to talk about. One night, at a dinner in late 2016, the conversation turned to harassment. Everybody agreed on one point: People can’t identify it and don’t know when to step in. A few mornings later, she woke up with the idea that VR could help. She taught herself basic programming, entered some hackathons, and within nine months had secured funding and signed up multiple partners.

That was the easy-ish part. The rest of Vantage Point’s plan involves making the simulations as immersive as possible. Mercer envisions an alternate script in which users practice reporting an incident. She also wants to add an interactive voice component, so users can literally speak up. Not all the work happens inside the headset, though. When Mercer recently showed an HR professional an early demo, they pointed out that Rachel, the only woman in the scene, was the designated note-taker. “We’re over here excited to explore these power dynamics,” Mercer says, “and didn’t even realize there’s a level of bias built into the training plan.” They just needed another vantage point.

118,A Brief History Of Oculus,"Less than two years ago, Oculus raised 2.5 million dollars on Kickstarter.

Yesterday, they were acquired by Facebook for $2 billion.

To write the words “A Brief History Of Oculus” is a bit funny — because really, the company’s very existence has been brief. From the launch of their Kickstarter campaign to their massive acquisition, just 601 days had passed.

The company has definitely generated its fair share of buzz in its short lifespan — and yet, many, many people are hearing about the team for the very first time this week.

For those people, and for everyone who might’ve missed some details along the way, here’s their story so far.

Early Days:

Around the age of 15, Palmer Luckey started to fall in love with the concept of virtual reality.

By day, he attended classes at the local community college. By night, he was the founder and admin of ModRetro, a community dedicated to modifying vintage gaming consoles. Taking a N64 and making it portable; contorting an Xbox into a package half its original size — that sort of thing.

If there’s anything that videogames have taught gamers to love, it’s collecting things — the rarer, the better. Palmer’s favorite thing to pick up? Early attempts at virtual reality headsets.

Throughout the late 80s and 90s, dozens of companies tried to turn VR headsets into commercial success. All of them failed — hard. Some were too expensive; most just didn’t work worth a damn. All of them were far too ahead of their time (with components being far too expensive to source, and most home computers being far too weak to power anything worth playing.)

Sourcing his collection everywhere from industry liquidation sales to government auctions and carting himself out to the seller to avoid paying for shipping, he’d get his hands on headsets that once cost nearly $100,000 for less than $100. By his own estimates, Palmer has the largest private collection of virtual reality headsets in the world.

Around the age of 16, Palmer took on a new hobby: building headsets of his own. Unhappy with the performance of everything he’d obtained, he set out to build something better. Some of the prototypes were pieced together from his collection; others were modified versions of displays other enthusiasts had put together; others were built entirely from off-the-shelf pieces.

Even then, though, it wasn’t entirely clear that there was a company in the making. He was attending classes at Cal State Long Beach, pursuing a journalism degree. Meanwhile, he worked as an engineer at USC’s Mixed Reality lab, experimenting with VR and head-mounted displays.

Becoming A Company:



You never know who you’re going to meet wandering around the Internet.

In Palmer’s case, a random crossing of digital paths made a connection that would very quickly define the company, raising it from “some crazy smart dudes building VR goggles in a garage” to something that just about everyone in the industry was keeping an eye on.

Lurking around yet another forum, Palmer found himself chatting with John Carmack — the John Carmack. As in, co-founder of id Software; the lead programmer of Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, and Quake. When it comes to gaming giants, most of’em sit comfortably within Carmack’s shadow.

As luck had it, Carmack had been playing with the idea of whipping up some VR goggles of his own, modifying a headset he had on hand. Palmer mentioned the prototypes he’d built.

As he told Eurogamer last year:

“… He ended up seeing my head-mounted display work and asked me, ‘Hey, what you have looks interesting – is there any chance I could buy one?’ He’s John Carmack,” Luckey snorts, “I just gave him one instead – you can’t turn him down.”

That was, perhaps, the best decision Luckey could have made. A few months later, Carmack was at E3 demonstrating one of Luckey’s prototypes — a hulk of duct tape and whatever components were convenient — to anybody who would watch.

Suddenly, this thing wasn’t just a passion project anymore. The Internet was suddenly on fire with talk of “Carmack’s new virtual reality project” — though Carmack wouldn’t officially join the company for over a year.

Something was happening. Almost overnight, it had become shockingly clear: if there was a time for Palmer to do this, to really do this, it was now.

Within weeks, just past halfway to his journalism degree, Palmer dropped out of college to start a company. In June of 2012, Palmer formed OculusVR.

Kickstarter

When Palmer first started thinking about Kickstarting a virtual reality headset — long before he met Carmack, long before he ever formed a company — he hoped he’d get 100 or so enthusiasts to back his project.

“I won’t make a penny of profit off this project, the goal is to pay for the costs of parts, manufacturing, shipping, and credit card/Kickstarter fees with about $10 left over for a celebratory pizza and beer.” wrote Palmer in early 2012.

Then came the endorsements from Carmack. Other industry titans, like Gabe Newell of Valve, threw their support behind the project. Thoughts of selling just 100 headsets went out the window.

On August 1st of 2012, Oculus launched their Kickstarter campaign. For a company with such ambitious (if newfound) plans — to revive an entire genre, to succeed where so many had failed only a decade ago — they had a rather modest campaign goal: $250,000. That’s less than some of those 90’s VR headsets from Palmer’s collection cost when they flopped onto the market.

Within 24 hours, they’d raised $670,000 from 2,750 people.

Within three days, they’d broken a million dollars.

(For reference: Around the time the Kickstarter ended, Oculus had 10 employees. By the time they sold to Facebook, they were at 100.)

Dev Kit 1:

Now, they weren’t using Kickstarter to pitch some incredibly polished, perfectly refined virtual reality headset that they’d somehow conjured out of thin air.

This was something… else. Something rougher. It was much, much prettier than that old duct-tape-tastic E3 prototype, mind you — but, with relatively weak specs and a chunky design, it wasn’t something they meant to sit on store shelves.

Instead, this first release was meant for developers and early adopters to get their feet wet with VR. To cleanse the palate of any bad taste left by the headsets of yesteryear. To get people building things in VR.

This dev kit (or Oculus Rift DK1, as it came to be known) gave most people their first glimpse at Oculus’ potential, and it made one thing clear: this little $350 dollar headset was already better than everything that came before it. But it wasn’t perfect.

Its low resolution screen (combined with magnification lenses that helped wrap the image around your view) made even the most beautifully rendered 3D environment look dated. It was like you were sitting too close to an old TV, or staring at the display through a screen door (aptly, this shortcoming quickly came to be known as “the screen door effect”)

This initial headset also lacked a feature that only really seems important once you notice it’s not there: positional tracking. While the headset’s sensors could keep tabs of how your head was angled (are you looking up? Down? Turned to the left?), it had absolutely no idea where your head was from moment to moment. You could look down at an object — but if you tried to lean in for a closer view, your in-game character did nothing. Bam! Immersion shattered.

Meanwhile, complaints of the headset causing motion sickness weren’t rare. That low-res screen, the early software, the lack of positional tracking — it all swirled together into something that managed to make some people’s inner-ears flip out and their stomaches turn.

Despite the flaws, Oculus managed to sell every last one of these headsets that they could make. They’d sourced enough components to make around 65,000 units of this first iteration — on February 21st of 2014, they officially sold out.

Could they have made more? Yes. But that would mean taking the time to source components for a now out-of-date product, as they were just weeks away from the debut of…

Dev Kit 2:

On the morning of March 19th (just one week before the Facebook acquisition) Oculus began accepting pre-orders for their second hardware release.

It still isn’t the exact product that Oculus intends to ship to consumers, but it’s close.

Based on a prototype that Oculus had started showing a few months prior, Developer Kit 2 (or DK2) fixed or improved upon many of the original headset’s flaws.

That old low-res display? They bumped it up considerably, from 640×800 in each eye to 960×1080 — increasing the overall pixel count by over 100%. That “screen door” effect isn’t completely gone, but it’s much, much less noticeable.

As for the motion sickness? Oculus figured out that much of it was triggered by the display’s tendency to blur motion. They countered this in three ways:

They switched the technology powering their display from LCD to OLED, which offers brighter screens with less motion blur

They decreased the latency of the headset (the delay between you moving your head and the content on screen reacting accordingly) from 60 milliseconds to 30 milliseconds

They began inserting entirely black frames (shown so quickly that they’re essentially invisible to the human eye) in between other frames to fool your brain into seeing a smoothly moving image.

Most significantly, they introduced an entirely new piece of hardware to the mix: an external camera. By using this camera to track an array of cleverly hidden infrared LEDs built into the DK2 headset, they were now able to detect not just how your head was angled, but where it was. Things like leaning in and out to read text, or to peek around a corner, or over a ledge, were suddenly possible for developers to support.

Everything In Between:

Barely one year passed between Oculus shipping their first developer kits (March 29th, 2013) and the start of pre-orders for version 2 (March 19th, 2014), but a ton happened in that time.

What Now?

Before the acquisition, Oculus had two big checkboxes left on their to-do list: to ship all of those pre-orders they got for the second development kit, and, eventually, to finalize and ship the consumer product.

With yesterday’s news that Facebook has bought them, however, they’ve given themselves a huge new challenge: to keep people on their side.

One of Oculus’ biggest strengths has always been in the way that people perceived it. You just wanted to root for them — and how could you not? It’s the tech world’s favorite tale: a brilliant whiz-kid turns his garage project into a company, makes millions.

Add in the fact that the company launched on Kickstarter, and Oculus had seemingly locked in its cred as something “homegrown”. Something “indie” — even when they went on to raise nearly $100M from traditional venture capitalists.

So of course, them being acquired by Facebook was met with backlash from some of their biggest fans. To them, Oculus was like their favorite band — and this was them “selling out”.

Within hours of the announcement, the top post on reddit was a drawing of reddit’s mascot laying flowers on Oculus’ grave. Many pledged to cancel their DK2 orders, and instructed others on how to do the same. Notch, the creator of Minecraft, immediately (and quite publicly) killed the company’s plans to build an Oculus version.

Oculus insists that they’ll remain absolutely independent at Facebook, publishing not one, not two, but three posts saying as much. When I sent the company an email with a few questions for this article, I (in haste) used the word “exit” to describe the acquisition, and they immediately took issue with the term. “This is not an exit,” they wrote back. “Oculus stays independent.”

Their challenge now is to somehow convince the world of this.

The best thing Facebook could do here? Keep their hands off of it for a (long) while. Throw money at it, but keep their branding and influence at bay (No one, and I mean no one, wants a Facebook-branded VR headset.) Let them ship the hardware they’ve promised, and to make what they ship better than anything they’ve promised so far. If this is a long term play, Facebook’s short term strategy should be to stay the hell away.",The potential for motion sickness.

119,See the World's Greatest Stolen Artworks in This Virtual-Reality Museum,"On March 18, 1990, two thieves disguised as Boston police officers walked into the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, handcuffed the guards on duty, and walked out with thirteen artworks valued at $300 million. The haul included pieces by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Degas. The works were never recovered, but Ziv Schneider is including them in an upcoming museum exhibition nonetheless.

Schneider, a student in NYU's ITP program, is the creator and curator of The Museum of Stolen Art, a virtual space dedicated to artworks ""that cannot be viewed physically anywhere in the world."" It's a museum that's only possible in virtual reality.

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

The virtual museum was designed to look just like a real one. The works hang on spare white walls, surrounded by ornate frames. An audio guide walks visitors through the halls. For Schneider, recreating the traditional museum environment was a chance to restore some dignity to these stolen works, which often just exist as thumbnail images on FBI and Interpol websites. ""I wanted to get the viewer to see the pieces in context, the same way they might in real life,"" she says.

Rembrandt's * A Lady and Gentleman in Black*, 1633, one of the works stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum

Schneider's planning three opening exhibitions. One is dedicated to famous stolen paintings, including those from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist. The other two exhibits focus on art looted from Iraq and Afghanistan. Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, nearly 14,000 objects were plundered from the Iraq Museum, one of the largest thefts of art in history.

With these collections, Schneider hopes to remind people how vulnerable physical artworks can be. We often reflect on the human toll of the conflicts in the Middle East, but Schneider's museum reminds us that culture can be a casualty, too. In Afghanistan, more than two thirds of the National Museum's artifacts were lost or destroyed as a result of the Soviet and Taliban occupations. ""I think these issues of cultures disappearing and suffering from war needs to be addressed,"" Schneider says. She hopes to open the museum to the public in coming months.

Today, this sort of thing makes for a novel design school project. But it's a compelling example of what could be totally commonplace in years to come, as virtual reality headsets proliferate. We know VR will transport us to impossible worlds---exotic planets and geometric landscapes and classrooms where we inhabit dolphin bodies. The Museum of Stolen Art is a reminder that there are much more prosaic versions of ""impossible"" worth exploring.

Thanks to Prosthetic Knowledge for the find.","It could be used to display stolen artworks. If virtual reality becomes more widespread, it could be used by criminals to display stolen artworks to potential buyers without the risk of getting caught.

120,Imax Ditched VR—but Big Theaters Are Buying In,"Once upon a time, the company with the biggest screens in the world made a big bet on virtual reality. Imax opened seven VR centers in movie theaters around the globe, each of which hosted a rotating selection of games, social experiences, and short narrative pieces. It set up a $50 million fund to develop content for those centers. It partnered with Google to build a next-generation camera that would allow filmmakers to realize their next-generation VR dreams.

Then it all disappeared. The camera project was canceled. That $50 million fund resulted in a single title, a Justice League tie-in that was so not-supersized that it could be purchased and played by home consumers. The VR centers started to close. This past December, Imax let shareholders know that the rest of it—the remaining centers and ""certain VR content investments""—would be winding down as well.

That was that, it seemed. VR and movie theaters seemed like a good match in theory, but if a player like Imax bows out, what chance would those crazy kids have?

A pretty good one, as it turns out. Because while Imax was closing its centers, other big theater chains were tiptoeing into the space, using a different playbook. Better VR, fewer locations, and taking it nice and slow.

The newest of those slow-roll experiments opens today at a massive multiplex in suburban San Jose, California. Carved into the cavernous lobby of the Century 20 Oakridge, a sleek wood-and-light mini-lobby sells tickets to the debut experience from VR company Spaces. Terminator Salvation: Fight For the Future is a four-person experience structured like a real-life action movie. It's ridiculous in some very good ways. It's also the second test area opened by Cinemark, the third-biggest theater chain in the US—and the best indicator yet that Imax's mistake wasn't enthusiasm but selectivity.

Location-based virtual reality (LBVR) has been a ray of light in VR's otherwise dreary economic dawn. But like any consumer entertainment sector, it's a big enough term to encompass a wide continuum of quality. On the cheap end are mall kiosks and ""VRcades"" that let you wear a decent headset—or sometimes a low-powered mobile one—to experience titles that are commercially available for home headset users.

The other end of the continuum is something so different as to feel like another technology altogether. Companies like The Void, Dreamscape Immersive, and Zero Latency offer customers high-end, bespoke VR experiences that are unlike anything on the market. Backpacks and haptic vests let you roam freely around a large space; trackers on your hands and feet make sure that you can see your own body—and everyone else's bodies as well. Everything you see in VR is mapped to the physical space, so if you reach out your hand to touch a wall or grip a railing you see in VR, you'll really touch it. Even real-world props are tracked, so you can wield tools and weapons or pick up objects. Blowers, misters, and rumble panels bombard you with external stimuli that match up with the virtual world. The result is a tactile wonderland that amplifies your sense of presence and the memories you come away with.

That's what Spaces built with its Terminator experience, and it's what convinced Cinemark CEO Mark Zoradi to partner with the VR company when he demo'd the technology a little more than a year ago. ""It was extraordinary from a tech standpoint,"" he says. ""But the social aspect was really innovative. You don’t do this individually—you’re on a team and you’re seeing each other’s faces. It’s very much a shared social experience. We just thought that was spectacular.""","The potential for VR to isolate people from one another. While VR technology has the potential to create shared social experiences, it also has the potential to create experiences that are isolated and individualistic.

121,"The Doctor Prescribes Video Games, VR Rehab, and Sensors","Amid the country's growing substance abuse crisis, last year the FDA cleared reSET, a mobile app that tracks substance use, cravings, and social triggers to treat dependency on alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis. The FDA's clearance makes reSET one of the first prescription “digital therapeutics”—an emerging class of evidence-based interventions that are predominantly driven by software rather than drugs.

WIRED OPINION ABOUT Andy Coravos is the CEO of Elektra Labs and a member of the Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science.

Earlier this year, digital medicine company Akili Interactive announced that its video game for children with ADHD demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. That milestone paves the way for what could be the first prescription video game. And this summer, Apple announced an FDA- cleared algorithm and app combo that uses Apple Watch data to detect atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart condition.

It's clear that software is exerting a powerful force on our health. Recent advancements in clinical-grade wearables, powerful machine learning algorithms, and a forward-looking FDA are giving rise to a new wave of software applications used to measure, diagnose, and treat disease. And unlike previous ""digital health,"" products, which might measure the fuzzy concept of wellness, these software-as-medicine tools demonstrate success in clinical trials.

Digital medicine manufacturers, like members of the recently formed Digital Therapeutics Alliance, have committed to undergo rigorous randomized, controlled clinical studies for their products. If cleared by regulators, doctors would prescribe many of these apps and algorithms just like they would drugs.

Apps and algorithms that measure health

Many tech companies are developing new connected tools and wearables that collect behavioral and physiological measurements. Those measurements, known as “digital biomarkers,” have the potential to move routine patient care from the clinic to the home.

At its annual conference, Apple highlighted ResearchKit and CareKit products, which can track data on seizures, asthma attacks, and heart disease. Verily, formerly Google Life Sciences, has released its own health-tracking watch for clinical trials. Even Fitbit is partnering with biotech company Biogen and online patient platform PatientsLikeMe to better understand multiple sclerosis.

Nevertheless, multiple randomized, controlled trials indicate that remote patient monitoring on its own does not seem to have an impact on health outcomes. “A remote monitor can give me 400 heart rate measurements, but what I really need is a better way to synthesize the data,” says Dr. David Levine, a clinician-investor at Harvard Medical School who runs The Home Hospital at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""We need the data to tell a clinically relevant story that helps doctors design the right intervention for a particular patient.""

That tide might now be turning. In the past few years, improved computational power and more robust datasets have given rise to powerful algorithms and data visualization tools that allow doctors to interpret health data quickly and easily.

Apps and algorithms that diagnose

Developing high-quality, reproducible algorithms to make medical decisions is a challenge. Healthcare giants IBM, Philips, and Siemens have already integrated artificial intelligence into their software systems—with mixed results. But a number of smaller companies have developed AI tools that have been cleared by the FDA for clinical settings, such as IDx-DR, an AI-based device to detect diabetic retinopathy in adults with diabetes.","Its potential to cause addiction.

122,Virtual Reality Advertisements Get in Your Face,"Companies like Facebook-owned Oculus VR, Sony, Microsoft, and Magic Leap are working on consumer-geared hardware, some of which is slated to begin selling late this year. Already, Oculus VR and Samsung have released the Gear VR, a $199 developer-geared headset that lets you experience 3-D games and videos by inserting a Samsung smartphone into the device.

MediaSpike is among several companies aiming to serve brands that want to advertise on these new platforms. Founder and CEO Blake Commagere says the company started out a few years ago working to bring sponsored content to smartphone- and tablet-based games. Now the company is thinking about how billboards, videos, and other kinds of product placement can fit into the computer-generated worlds viewed on devices like the Gear VR, as well as on headsets that don’t yet have a firm release date.

From inside the headgear, it still looks pretty primitive. Before the blimp ride, I was driving around MediaSpike’s digitally rendered town, which is empty of activity beyond the movie billboards, blimp, and a giant display in a vacant town square that’s showing the trailer for the upcoming Minions film. I found it nauseating, too (a common complaint from people using stereoscopic 3-D technologies because of the disconnect between your visual and physical senses). But it’s still a heck of a lot more interesting than the banner and pop-up ads we’re used to seeing on websites and mobile apps.

The huge value of the online advertising market suggests it could be lucrative to experiment in this area. According to Magna Global, a media market researcher and investor, digital media revenue rose 17 percent in 2014 to $142 billion. It’s expected to climb another 15 percent to $163 billion globally this year.

A virtual billboard advertises a theme-park ride related to the Despicable Me animated films.

Dallas-based Airvirtise certainly hopes advertisers will be willing to try to reach people inside virtual scenes. It’s working on virtual 3-D models that are integrated with real-world locations, which it discerns from longitude, latitude, and elevation—think a giant Angry Birds game in a park or a life-size virtual car you can walk around. These things would initially be viewable through smartphone apps and eventually through the lenses of augmented-reality eyewear.

Founder and CEO Kevin Hart describes what the company has been showing off at the SXSW festival this week: a computer-generated drone seemingly hovering in the air about 20 feet away, with a banner flying below it, visible only when viewed through the camera lens of an iPad. As you move closer to the virtual drone, he says, it will get appropriately larger by taking into account motion sensors on the iPad to determine your location and position, allowing you to walk under and around it.

A company that has already had some success merging virtual ads with the real world is Blippar. A smartphone app created by the company can be used to view sponsored augmented-reality content, such as virtual footballers on Pepsi cans, or virtual nail polish shades from Maybelline.

There will be plenty of challenges ahead for companies working to bring ads to virtual and augmented reality. Beyond the obvious difficulty of working with emerging technologies, Hart and others must figure out what kinds of ads users will respond to, and which they might find too overwhelming or obnoxious.

Commagere acknowledges that, as with product placement in movies, it will be possible to overdo it with virtual products. (One example of this occurred during my blimp ride, when I turned around to see a pixelated can of Pepsi perched next to the craft’s control panel.) But he’s hopeful that this will feel less intrusive than conventional pop-ups and other types of distracting Web ads.

“I can’t imagine having a banner at the bottom of a VR screen the entire time,” he says. “That would be infuriating.”","The potential for users to find virtual ads too overwhelming or obnoxious. While it may be possible to avoid some of the more intrusive ads by carefully placing them in the virtual world, it is also possible that users will simply find them too distracting and annoying.

123,Virtual Therapists Help Veterans Open Up About PTSD,"When US troops return home from a tour of duty, each person finds their own way to resume their daily lives. But they also, every one, complete a written survey called the Post-Deployment Health Assessment. It’s designed to evaluate service members’ psychiatric health and ferret out symptoms of conditions like depression and post-traumatic stress, so common among veterans.

But the survey, designed to give the military insight into the mental health of its personnel, can wind up distorting it. Thing is, the PDHA isn’t anonymous, and the results go on service members’ records—which can deter them from opening up. Anonymous, paper-based surveys could help, but you can’t establish a good rapport with a series of yes/no exam questions. Veterans need somebody who can help. Somebody who can carry their secrets confidentially, and without judgement. Somebody they can trust.

Or, perhaps, something.

""People are very open to feeling connected to things that aren't people,"" says Gale Lucas, a psychologist at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies and first author of a new, Darpa-funded study that finds soldiers are more likely to divulge symptoms of PTSD to a virtual interviewer—an artificially intelligent avatar, rendered in 3-D on a television screen—than in existing post-deployment health surveys. The findings, which appear in the latest issue of the journal Frontiers in Robotics and AI, suggest that virtual interviewers could prove to be even better than human therapists at helping soldiers open up about their mental health.

“Most people would assume these things are in conflict with each other—that you can’t have anonymity and rapport at the same time,” Lucas says. But a virtual interviewer can offer both. A few years ago, Lucas and her colleagues paired hundreds of test subjects with Ellie, an embodied AI designed to engage test subjects in verbal interviews. Participants sat alone in a room with the virtual therapist, who appeared and communicated via a television screen. Ellie would begin with general questions like “Where are you from?” to build rapport; gradually proceed to more sensitive, clinical queries, like “How easy is it for you to get a good night’s sleep”; and finish with mood-boosting questions, like “What are you most proud of?”

With a virtual interviewer, you don't have to ruin your career to begin seeking help. USC Psychologist Gale Lucas

But Ellie is no brainless bot. Unlike, say, Eliza, the 1960s computer program designed to respond to users with non-directional questions, Ellie uses machine vision to interpret test subjects’ verbal and facial cues and respond supportively. For example, Ellie not only knows how to perform sympathetic gestures, like nodding, smiling, or quietly uttering “mhm” when listening to a sensitive story—she knows when to perform them. Psychologists call these kinds of sounds and gestures backchannels. When interspersed appropriately throughout an interaction, they can help build rapport and elicit sharing.

Ellie's capacity for subtle and supportive engagement reveals fascinating things about humans, and how we choose to guard our secrets. Lucas and her colleagues told half their test subjects they’d be interacting anonymously with a virtual therapist. The other half were deceived into thinking there was a person pulling Ellie's strings. In the end, the participants who thought they were talking with the virtual therapist alone were significantly more likely to open up. For civilians, at least, just removing the idea of human presence led to more fruitful clinical sessions.

To see if Ellie could help soldiers reveal their PTSD symptoms, Lucas and her colleagues recruited soldiers recently returned from Afghanistan. As in the previous study, Ellie began each interview with rapport-building questions and ended with positive, mood-boosting ones. But this time, Ellie’s clinical questions were geared toward symptoms of PTSD, specifically. Questions like:","Ellie's capacity for subtle and supportive engagement reveals fascinating things about humans, and how we choose to guard our secrets.

124,Oculus Game Lucky's Tale Will Blow Your Mind,"I've tried to describe Lucky's Tale, with words and stuff, to other people at the E3 show here in Los Angeles. I can't do it. I usually end up saying, ""You've just got to go try it.""

Oculus still hasn't said anything about when it plans to ship the consumer version of its virtual reality headset. But it's already working with game developers to show off some real games -- not tech demos, but actual consumer products it's developing as first-party software for the Rift. One of them is Lucky's Tale, created by Playful, the new studio started by Paul Bettner, co-creator of Words With Friends.

So imagine a Mario 64-style third-person cartoony run-and-jump platformer game. Now imagine that the Oculus take on this is not that you are seeing every vomit-inducing jump and roll from Mario's eyes, but that you're just hanging out watching as Mario does all this stuff. You're in there with him, controlling his moves, but you're on the sidelines. And by moving your head around you can get better views of the action.

That's Lucky's Tale. It doesn't sound like it should work, sounds like kind of a waste of virtual reality -- what, it's just like playing a regular videogame but the screen wraps around your head? But the sense of presence is staggering. It's like you're actually in there. When Lucky hits a box and stars pop out of the top of it, you naturally look upwards to see where they're going to fall. And at that moment you feel like you're staring up at the sky in real life, looking at things that are about to fall on you.

If you don't expect that this would be so impressive, neither did I, and neither did Paul Bettner.

""When we first got together with Oculus, we looked at this new platform and realized, all the rules of making games just got thrown out the window,"" he told WIRED on Tuesday in a meeting room within Oculus' E3 booth. ""When we realized that... we decided the only way to figure this out was to rapidly create one prototype after another.""

Bettner and his team, working alongside Oculus, cranked out all kinds of different, playable game ideas, over 40 of them, over the course of four months. But it was the third-person platformer that stuck. ""The moment we saw it, we were just blown away -- oh my gosh, this works better than anything else we've tried,"" he said.

There's a cool only-in-VR moment as well. Lucky can pick up and throw bombs, and you've got to aim at targets by just moving your head and focusing your gaze on the bullseye. It's intuitive, simple and deadly accurate.

The flexible nature of the cartoon platform game, Bettner says, means we can expect all sorts of experimenting with the play controls in Lucky's Tale.

""It gives us an excuse to put all these different experiences into one game,"" he says. ""If I'm a gamer and I just got my shiny new Oculus, I want a game that's going to take me to all these different places and do all these different things.""

That's the big question -- now that we're starting to see some full games that promise to blow us away with the power of VR, when can consumers expect to actually get their hands on a finished Oculus Rift?

""We designed this as a launch game for the consumer Rift, so our launch date is their launch date,"" Bettner says. Now I really can't wait for that day.",People may become addicted to it and not want to leave their homes.

125,Billionaires See VR as a Way to Avoid Radical Social Change,"The future of virtual reality is far more than just video games. Silicon Valley sees the creation of virtual worlds as the ultimate free-market solution to a political problem. In a world of increasing wealth inequality, environmental disaster, and political instability, why not sell everyone a device that whisks them away to a virtual world free of pain and suffering?

Tech billionaires aren’t shy about sharing this. “Some people read this the wrong way and react incorrectly to it. The promise of VR is to make the world you wanted. It is not possible, on Earth, to give everyone all that they would want. Not everyone can have Richard Branson’s private island,” Doom co-creator and former CTO of Oculus John Carmack told Joe Rogan during a 2020 interview. “People react negatively to any talk of economics, but it is resource allocation. You have to make decisions about where things go. Economically, you can deliver a lot more value to a lot of people in the virtual sense.”

Virtual reality is an attractive escape, but it’s not a solution to the world’s ills. The problems of the real world will persist beyond the borders of the metaverse created by companies such as Epic, Valve, and Facebook. Without decisive and radical action, our planet will continue to burn, the gap between the rich and poor will grow, and totalitarian political movements will flourish. All while some of us are plugged into a virtual world.

Worse, the virtual world will be one owned and controlled by the companies that create them. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a Facebook-branded set of VR goggles strapped to an emaciated human face—forever.

By the principle of the free market Silicon Valley lives and dies by, virtual reality is a loser. Only 1.7 percent of Steam users have a VR headset, according to a December 2020 hardware survey. And while it’s true that sales of headsets are up during the pandemic, roughly 30 percent in 2020 over 2019, video game sales in general are up overall.

Valve released Half-Life: Alyx in March 2020, just as the lockdowns were beginning. This was the first new Half-Life game in 13 years, the continuation of a franchise fans had been desperate to play for more than a decade. It sold well for a VR title, somewhere north of 2 million copies, but didn’t match the incredible numbers of 2020’s top-selling titles and was quickly forgotten by the mainstream press. Unless you’re really into VR, you probably weren’t talking about Half-Life in 2020.

The reasons why are obvious. First, virtual reality is expensive. At the high end, Valve’s premiere headset—the Valve Index—costs $1,000. On the cheaper end, Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 is $299. To play Alyx, those headsets need to be wired to a high-end gaming PC. The price of these machines vary, but something that can handle VR will cost around $1,000. Once the machine is built and the headset hooked up, the player will need to carve out a dedicated physical space to play the game. Most games require a minimum of about 6.5 feet by 5 feet, but the more space you have the better.","It could further isolate people from the real world.

126,These FX Wizards May Have Solved VR Films' Biggest Problem,"Sebastian Marino already has an Academy Award for his special-effects work on James Cameron's Avatar, but the other evening he became a director, and staged a tiny shoot in his apartment. He and a small crew set up an array of cameras and filmed two actresses in front of a green screen. Only one of them delivered lines. ""I imagine you're feeling a bit like Alice right now,"" she said enigmatically, ""tumbling down the rabbit hole. Like her, I would suggest that you choose carefully."" She pointed in one direction, then another. And that was it; they took down the green screen, and everyone went home.

But Sebastian Marino wasn't done. The next step was to turn that tiny shoot into the future.

Overnight, the data he'd captured with his cameras simmered; in the morning, he dropped the resulting file into the Unity 3D videogame engine and placed the actresses in a bare-bones apartment. In one room, a neon sign on one wall read WE WANT WHAT WE SEE, and a lamp against another wall cast its light across the actress' right side. In the other room, he made the interior light red and darkened everything so you couldn't see that the other model wasn't wearing much. After all, when you're making the future, you don't want to be, as Marino said later, ""overly suggestive.""

The thing is, this wasn't a videogame. It was a movie—and, even better, quite possibly the first actual VR movie to use human beings. The actress who gave the Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole speech looked nothing like a videogame character who was waving from the other side of the Uncanny Valley; she looked like herself. She was wearing the same clothes, her face moved perfectly, and her motions were fluid and flawless. Yet, she was standing in a room that didn't, in any real way, exist.

What Marino has managed to do, along the rest of his fledgeling VR company Uncorporeal, is solve in a very real way the cardinal problem that plagues the prospects of virtual filmmaking. And what's even more astonishing is that he and his two co-founders—whose careers encompass decades of wizardry at Lucasfilm/ILM, WETA, the Euro Space Agency, Google X, Microsoft, and Electronic Arts—have done it in stealth mode. They provided the company's seed funding themselves, they've never shown up at a VR conference, and they've used email accounts belonging to a holding company so that no one caught wind of the name Uncorporeal. ""The number of people that have seen our stuff,"" Marino says, ""you can count on your fingers and toes.""

If you hadn't noticed by now, we are way down the rabbit hole.

Caught In the Frame

As we careen headlong toward 2016 and the long-awaited launch of consumer VR, there's still one very real problem plaguing the medium. It's not simulator sickness, or display resolution, or optical solutions; all of those things are effectively solved by now, and while they're not perfect, they're unimaginably better than they were even 18 months ago. It's not input; the three consumer systems coming (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Playstation VR) have demonstrable and elegant control schemes. And it's not content: from dozens of game titles under development to Netflix apps to virtual museum tours, a robust pipeline ensures that early adopters will have plenty to do.

The problem is movies. Specifically, live-action video capture. Consumer VR relies on external cameras to track your headset in space, and then translate its movements and positions into virtual environments. It's called positional tracking, and in VR gaming it's what allows you to crouch behind a desk, or peek around a boulder, or look under a table by making those movements in real life—crouching, leaning, bending. But there's currently no way to bring positional tracking to video.

Think about it: If you position an array of cameras around a central point to act as the ""eye"" of the person wearing the headset, then you're stuck with whatever 360-degree view you get from that vantage point. Of VR's optimal ""six degrees of freedom""—nodding your head, turning your head, tilting your head left/right, and actually moving through space on three axes—VR video is thus far confined to moving your body. In other words, you can look around all you want, but you can't change your position, no matter how much you crouch and lean. (And with your brain registering physical movement without seeing movement reflected in your field of vision, you might actually feel some discomfort.)","It can cause simulator sickness.

127,New VR Film Perspective 2: The Misdemeanor Drops You in the Middle of a Police Shooting,"Most stories about new virtual reality films or documentaries contain some description of the experience itself—with so many people still having never experienced the medium, to do otherwise would be a disservice. Yet, to do that for any part of *Perspective 2: The Misdemeanor *would risk diluting a viscerally haunting experience. So take this shred of a synopsis and know it contains multitudes: The new project, from director Rose Troche and her VR partner Morris May, which just debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, puts the user on all sides of a police-involved shooting.

It’s the second experience in Troche and May's Perspective series—the first let people experience two sides of a sexual assault. The goal this time, Troche says, is to show an even-handed representation of everyone involved in a fictional police shooting: a teenager who gets shot, his brother, and two officers. The viewers’ perception of what happened in the shooting changes each time they watch a different perspective. Which is the whole point.

“Everybody has made a mistake in this whole thing, and it escalates so quickly,” says Troche. “But it’s really for you to experience, to try to feel what it’s like to have that fear, to feel like Oh my god, what did I just do? I just shot someone. We wanted to show the wholeness of the situation.”

It’s really for you to experience, to try to feel what it’s like to have that fear, to feel like Oh my god, what did I just do? I just shot someone. We wanted to show the wholeness of the situation. director Rose Troche

Perspective 2: The Misdemeanor is something that’s really never been done with VR before. There are experiences that deal with social justice issues, for sure, but they’re usually documentaries. What Troche and May’s experience does is use a hypothetical situation to give viewers an experience that they would otherwise (hopefully) get in a mediated form, whether via news reports or low-quality video clips uploaded to social media sites. It’s the kind of thing that can only be done with the immersive and empathy-inducing power of VR. “It’s a way to use the medium that’s so successful,” says May, CEO of VR outfit Specular Theory.

It also is coming at a time when people on all sides of the issue are grappling with how to respond to police brutality. Even Troche, who grew up in Chicago and had more than a few situations growing up where “I felt like ‘shit’s going to go down,’” struggled with her feelings on the issue. To get authentic perspectives from all sides of the encounter, she spoke to young people in her Brooklyn neighborhood as well as family members who work in law enforcement. She also, unfortunately, got a lot more information on police-involved shootings over the last year while she worked on the project as news of hundreds of deaths filled newspapers, cable news networks, and social media feeds.

“This has the same motivation as last year’s piece, which was to move a conversation forward,” says Troche, who started her career with indie films like Go Fish. “Living in New York with the [#BlackLivesMatter] protests that were going on, and with these things just continuing to happen, it felt to me like the philosophically natural next place to go.”

As of now, the self-financed project has no distribution deal in place, so for the foreseeable future people will only be able to see Perspective 2: The Misdemeanor at film festivals like Sundance. While the issue of how to get people to watch VR is one that’s plaguing the entire industry right now, Troche and May would especially like to get their project in front of as many people as possible—if for no other reason than to can help provide insight into an issue people have often made up their minds about.

“Who will approach the piece and only watch one thing and think that they have the story?"" says Troche. ""That’s pretty much what we have in real life. The piece demonstrates the fact that just because you’re there, doesn’t mean you see everything. Through the four strings, you get to see the full picture.”","Virtual reality has the potential to further entrench people in their own perspectives, and make it even harder for them to empathize with others. When people are only exposed to one side of an issue, it can be very difficult for them to understand the other side.

128,FTC antitrust watchdogs reportedly investigating Meta's VR division ...,"The US Federal Trade Commission and at least three states are investigating Meta for antitrust violations in its virtual reality division, according to Bloomberg. The report says the FTC and attorneys general from New York, Tennessee, and North Carolina began speaking last year with third-party VR developers who have concerns about Meta’s business practices. It’s one of multiple probes into Meta’s dominance in the small but growing market of VR.

The Bloomberg report references well-known controversies around Meta (formerly Facebook) and its VR division (formerly Oculus). Regulators have reportedly asked developers if the Oculus app store discriminates against third-party apps whose features overlap with its own offerings, and they’ve apparently questioned Meta’s strategy of selling the Meta Quest (formerly Oculus Quest) headset at a $299 price point that heavily undercuts the price of other VR headsets. The FTC declined to comment on Bloomberg’s report.

The FTC has allegedly already opened a probe into Meta’s acquisition of Within, the company behind VR fitness app Supernatural. The US Justice Department also reportedly investigated similar claims in late 2020. German regulators publicly announced an investigation around the same time.

So far, VR has still gotten little attention compared to other Meta divisions. The FTC is currently pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against the company over its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp; after a setback last year, a judge revived the suit earlier this week. But as Meta has begun emphasizing its role as a steward of a VR-heavy “metaverse,” the area may invite more legal scrutiny as well.","The potential for antitrust violations. If Meta is found to be discriminating against third-party apps whose features overlap with its own offerings, or if it is found to be selling the Meta Quest headset at a price that undercuts the price of other VR headsets, it could face antitrust action from the FTC or other regulators.

129,Oculus Execs Believe Controllers Are The Missing Link In Virtual Reality,"When you put a child in virtual reality, they instinctively raise their hands hoping to see them, says Oculus CTO John Carmack. Yet Oculus doesn’t have its own gloves or handheld controllers, despite rumors amongst the VR community that Oculus would reveal a controller today at its Oculus Connect conference. Carmack concluded “The missing link in VR is controllers”.

But considering ‘The Future Of VR’ panel with the Oculus execs started with the question of “where is the VR controller?”, it seems clear the company will move to build or support handheld input devices.

In fact, early today during their demo of the new Oculus Crescent Bay headset prototype as source told an Oculus employee they wished there was a controller, and the employee responded “it’s coming.” Yet currently, Carmack says that people want to see their hands in virtual reality, “and we’ve got nothing there right now”.

What that will look like is still coming together, though. Carmack, the famed technologist from Quake-marker id Software, said that “Controllers is such a factious and contentious issue that it’s not going to be clear when someone wins.” Oculus’ 22-year old founder Palmer Luckey said that “There’s no clear path towards what is best [for controllers]. People haven’t identified the problems.”

Eye tracking was another form of input the Oculus big wigs discussed as part of the future of VR. The idea is that rather than turning your head to move your vision, you could one day just glance around. Oculus Chief Scientist Michael Abrash discussed that VR headsets would probably have to support “foveated rendering“. This means that the resolution of an image fluctuates so the most important parts are higher-res. What’s important can be determined through eye tracking. However, Abrash said foveated rendering is probably still too computationally intense for current VR rigs to handle. In the end, though, the top priority is to not make people sick.

As for where Oculus goes with input devices, Luckey did confirm that it has been doing testing in the handheld input space, but it’s been a challenge. “It’s surprising how accurate you have to be [with detecting head movements as a controller] to make it good, and you have to do the same with your hands. Having any latency makes you feel like your hand is dead.”

Today’s Oculus Crescent Bay announcement was all about creating a headset which offers true “Presence”, where you feel like you’re actually transported into the virtual world. With a motion tracking headset where you can tilt, lean, duck, and even walk around a little, it’s coming close to accomplishing the first stage Presence, where it’s immersive as long as you don’t try to run around or lift your arms. But as Oculus Chief Architect Atman Binstock said, the next frontier is “Hand Presence”.

During the Q&A I asked what the execs thought were the advantages and disadvantages of different input devices like dual-wielding nunchuks, motion tracking, and gloves, and which is each of their favorites. Luckey responded that a great device for guns is not the same as a great device for swords is not a great device for productivity apps. He said there will need to be a device that’s good for generally interacting with virtual worlds, though. With so many different use cases for VR and different corresponding input devices, it leads me to believe that Oculus will build a platform for connecting third-party input devices to its headsets. This would leave controller fragmentation to the developer community so Oculus can focus on generalizable problems and opportunities that exist across VR apps.","The potential for VR to cause people to feel sick.

130,"The Incredible, Urgent Power of Remembering the Holocaust in VR","Pinchas Gutter has returned to Majdanek at least a dozen times, but this trip is his final one to the onetime Nazi concentration camp. His first was one he was 11, when he was taken to Majdanek; now he's 85 years old, and this is the last time he'll come here to tell people what the Nazis did to his family. As he rides up to the shuttered camp in the backseat of a chauffeured sedan, he talks about why he's told his story so many times. Without that living, breathing reminder, the Holocaust becomes easy to forget—or even deny. Without personal accounts, Gutter says, it’s hard for people to accept its atrocities as “the gospel truth.”

Gutter is right about that. That’s why his trip to Majdanek, and the horrific experiences he recounts in the camp’s barracks and crematorium, are being preserved with virtual reality—thanks to the USC Shoah Foundation. The Last Goodbye, which is debuting at this week's Tribeca Film Festival, is a 17-minute VR experience that the Holocaust remembrance foundation produced expressly to add to its archive of survivor testimonies. Each of those video interview accounts acts as a record of a person’s experience with genocide, but the immersive capabilities of VR in The Last Goodbye allows Gutter to tell his story—the last time he saw his parents and twin sister alive, the moment in the camp’s shower room when he was certain he was going to die—in the spaces where they happened.

“Knowledge is one thing, but connecting to history enables us to think about consequences in a deeper more personal way,” says Shoah executive director Stephen Smith. “What this technology allows us to do is learn in a much more immersive way so you don’t forget this.”

Virtual Reality, Not Fake News

Preserving history is more necessary now than ever. Just last week White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, referencing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s use of sarin gas, said that Adolf Hitler ""didn't even sink to using chemical weapons."" The misstep led human-rights nonprofit Anne Frank Center to call on President Trump to fire Spicer. The problem runs deeper than gaffes, though; as a recent New York Times story reported, understanding of World War II and of the six million people who died in the Holocaust is fading as the number of survivors diminishes. (Estimates put the number of remaining survivors at around a half-million, and most are in their 80s, if not older.) As Holocaust deniers get bigger megaphones thanks to the internet and anything can be labeled “fake news,” a survivor's testimony—captured in the camp where he was imprisoned—is about the most powerful tool imaginable for preserving history.

Courtesy of The Last Goodbye

But, technologically speaking, capturing Gutter’s story wasn’t easy. A standard 360-degree video could have captured Gutter telling his story at Majdanek, but the experience would have been limited; users wouldn’t have been able to move closer to Gutter or get a better look at the camp’s various rooms. For that, you'd need to use a videogame engine to build a CG environment. But then co-creators Gabo Arora (Ground Beneath Her) and Ari Palitz found a workaround: photogrammetry. When they went to Majdanek to film in July 2016, they brought along a crew from graphics company Otoy to capture thousands of images and 3-D scans of the camp. They then captured Gutter telling his story at the camp against greenscreen. When they returned, the team handed over 30,000 pictures and 300 million polygons—basically the pixels in the mesh of a 3-D scan—to VFX company MPC, which then spent the next six months stitching them together to create a VR environment users could explore with Gutter by their side.

It was important that we film Pinchas Gutter in the spaces that he experienced these things during the Holocaust—that we captured those rooms in photogrammetry and he was really there. That way, when users go through this experience they feel like he was connected to the space, as opposed to filming him on a stage in Burbank. Last Goodbye co-director Ari Palitz

Making the recreation accurate to a pixel-by-pixel level was absolutely integral. Holocaust deniers, Smith notes, often point to small details as proof that something was falsified, and the very point of Last Goodbye was its authenticity. Tim Dillon, MPC's head of VR, says that as his team went through and pieced together the experience they had a ""really important agenda to keep everything extremely factual. ... We didn't want to do anything in modeling or CG terms that seemed fake in any way."" This became particularly tough when the team was trying to remove signage—Majdanek is a museum, now, after all—from the background of shots. It was a tough process, but the result feels as real as anything in VR can right now.

""It was important that we film [Pinchas Gutter] in the spaces that he experienced these things during the Holocaust—that we captured those rooms in photogrammetry and he was really there,"" says co-director Ari Palitz. ""That way, when users go through this experience they feel like he was connected to the space, as opposed to filming him on a stage in Burbank.""

History Presented by Hamilton's Set Designer

When users go through Gutter’s experience this week at Tribeca, they’ll be doing it in a room-scale HTC Vive setup. They’ll also be going through it on a set created by David Korins, Hamilton's production designer—who has also designed stage sets for Lady Gaga and Kanye West. The structure sits atop a bed of gravel and is covered in mirrors. The idea, Korins says, was for the space to reflect its environment and also each person’s reaction. “There are so many emotional on-ramps that people have with regard to this subject matter that I think I would be presumptuous to try and prescribe,” Korins says. “My hope is that the kind of environment we’ve created allows for anyone’s attachment to history, whether it’s incredibly specific or it’s just a vague idea, can have a place to live.”","It has the potential to make people forget the reality of the Holocaust.

131,How to Reduce VR Sickness? Just Add a Virtual Nose,"In the 1950s, the Navy introduced a simulator that taught pilots to fly a helicopter from the comfort of a virtual cockpit. They could take off, navigate bumpy air and land without ever leaving the ground. It was a breakthrough that allowed an increasing number of pilots to train without the risk of crashing. But the sim wasn't all that comfortable, and a significant number of pilots felt sick as hell while using it.

It wasn’t motion sickness per se, though the symptoms were comparable: Dizziness, nausea, sweating, disorientation. Researchers of the day dubbed this physiological phenomenon “simulator sickness,” an early ancestor of the flu-like symptoms some feel after strapping on virtual reality headsets today.

Eliminating simulator sickness is a major interest of the burgeoning VR industry, but so far there hasn't been a clear answer. Home remedies include drinking alcohol, while companies like Oculus Rift are exploring better positional tracking and improved display resolution. But researchers at Purdue University believe they've found a way to reduce the negative physical effects of virtual reality by using something that’s right in front of your face.

“We’ve discovered putting a virtual nose in the scene seems to have a stabilizing effect,” says David Whittinghill, an assistant professor in Purdue University's Department of Computer Graphics Technology. That’s right, Whittinghill says placing a schnoz in the lower center of a headset's screen has been shown to reduce the effects of simulator sickness by 13.5 percent.

Simulator sickness is still being studied, but researchers often point to sensory conflict a primary cause. This theory states that a dissonance between what your eyes see on screen and the kind of motion your body feels can lead to disorientation and feelings of nausea. Say you’re riding a virtual roller coaster. As you creep up the coaster’s first big hill, your eyes will register an upward incline, but your vestibular system---the tubes of liquid in our ears that help us to gauge our position in the world---remains unchanged. “Our bodies don’t like that,” says Whittinghill.

Whittinghill and his team of students (Bradley Ziegler, James Moore, and Tristan Case) say anecdotal evidence shows a fixed reference point in a frame, like car dashboards and cockpits, tend to reduce feelings of simulator sickness. It got them thinking about the nose as a natural reference point and how it's conspicuously absent from goggle-like virtual reality headsets.

In the small study, the team had 41 participants use various VR applications (one simulation of walking around a Tuscan villa, another of riding a roller coaster). Half played the games with the virtual nose, the other half played without. Whittinghill found participants with the nose were able to play the Tuscan villa game for 94.2 seconds longer than those playing without, while time played on the roller coaster game increased by 2.2 seconds.

“That’s not enough,” says Whittinghill. But it is a promising start, particularly because the participants playing with the virtual nose didn’t even notice it was there. “It’s a big honking nose,” he says. “It never occurred to us that they wouldn’t perceive it, but they were almost universally baffled about what we were even talking about.” Whittinghill says this is likely a result of “change blindness,” a perceptual phenomenon that allows our perceptual system to ignore objects that we see over and over again. Whittinghill’s theory is that the nose’s proximity to our eyes leads our brains to filter out its presence. “It’s likely to be hitting those same sensory neurons,” he explains. “I’m just guessing the neurons are saying no, this isn’t a real object, I’m going to subtract this from my perception.”","The development of simulator sickness.

132,Horrifying VR Film Puts You Inside a Drunk Driving Crash,"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwRCyW9bcV4

If you learned how to drive in the US, there’s a good chance you suffered through Red Asphalt---the famously gory driver’s ed film the California Highway Patrol has been making and remaking since the 60s.

Now the time-honored tradition of scaring teens into staying sober behind the wheel with gruesome images has taken on a new dimension: virtual reality.

Diageo, the British liquor company that owns Johnnie Walker, Baileys, and Guinness, has tapped VR tech to convey the risks of drunk driving with an extra dose of drama. Decisions puts you inside three cars destined for a fatal encounter late at night on a stretch of rural road. A couple on their first date after having a baby, three twenty-somethings heading to a party, and Sam, a young woman leaving a bar after a meeting that included bottle service.

The company plans to roll out its full setup---complete with a motion-chair---at events like music festivals, and to work with police departments and school systems to get teens into the experience. For everyone else, the four-minute horror show is now available via VR channels on YouTube, Facebook, and The New York Times.

Decisions retains its potency even as a 3D YouTube video seen sans goggles and chair. As Sam drunkenly caroms down the road, you sense the increasingly erratic movement of the car, the jarring vibration when she briefly drifts off the road. You can look around, see the traffic on the road, and glimpse back to view her behind the wheel.

Virtual reality makes sense for this application: It’s aces at eliciting emotions more effectively than two-dimensional media. The ability to look around, even as a bystander---to see the traffic on the road and the driver ineptly shifting gears---makes the tension more intense and palpable as the crash nears.

The PSA’s creators, led by New York advertising agency VaynerMedia, are banking on that immersion. “What you want is for the user to feel what the experience is like in that car,” says director Jason Beauregard. “That sensation and feeling comes from the experience hitting your emotional receptors. It heightens your senses in a way you don’t get with conventional film, and you really feel that with the twist in the end, when essentially you, as a viewer but also a character, die.”

Beauregard used a high-end, 24-camera Jaunt ONE system designed specifically for capturing high-speed VR content, and a Sony A7-based array well-suited to low-light filming. The film’s end might not earn an “R” rating, but it’s grisly and evocative. Diageo hopes it’s just harrowing enough to convince people to keep this virtual experience from coming to life.","It may desensitize people to real-life violence. While the immersive qualities of VR can make for a more effective PSA, there is a risk that people may become so used to seeing virtual violence that it no longer has the same impact on them.

133,A Simulator for Brain Surgeons,"“This is the first simulator to fully integrate medical image processing, material models, finite element modeling, graphics, and haptics technologies to create a patient-specific simulation,” says Ryan D’Arcy, an NRC neuroscientist who helped develop NeuroTouch. “One other notable feature is the incorporation of functional brain mapping data from fMRI.” This allows critical brain regions, such as speech areas, to be imaged more accurately, D’Arcy says.

The $9.1 million, three-year project to develop a neurosurgery simulator began in April 2008 and involves some 50 clinicians and engineers from across Canada. The project marked a milestone last month when surgeons in Halifax, Nova Scotia, used it to rehearse before operating on a 48-year-old woman with a benign tumor near the speech center of her brain. The five-hour operation was successful, and the woman was discharged the following day. Though the procedure was relatively simple, it was the first time a simulator had been used to run through such an operation.

Lead surgeon David Clarke of Halifax’s Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Center praised the prototype for being very realistic. “The surgery team went in there with a knowledge and confidence that we could not otherwise have,” Clarke said after the surgery. “I think that that is not only good in terms of discussions with patients beforehand, but is good for their overall surgical outcome.”

As brain operations become less invasive but more complex, younger surgeons may be better trained using a simulator, says Rolando Del Maestro of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, who was involved with the project. “We neurosurgeons are going to be like simulator pilots, so we can find out if our skills are at a certain level,” says Del Maestro, who adds that the simulator might help accelerate training.

Abhijit Guha, a neurosurgeon at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children, who is unaffiliated with NeuroTouch, says that virtual surgery will never replace the real thing. “One weakness of the system is that it is based on archival MRI scans, which may not be valid as surgery proceeds due to brain and cerebrospinal fluid shifts,” Guha says. “Also, there is the judgment factor, especially when something goes wrong.”

A technical limitation of the prototype is that it can only represent tumors close to the surface of the brain, and surgeons can only use one hand. Development will continue through April 2011, however, and the final device will allow doctors to work on deep brain tumors with multiple surgical tools and both hands.

NRC plans to send prototypes to neurosurgery centers across Canada, and then transfer the technology to a commercial partner within two years. A commercial version could sell for $10,000 to $500,000, depending on its functions. “The package will include a PC-based planner for optimal surgical corridor selection as well as a trainer for surgical tasks and typical surgical procedures,” says NRC’s Robert DiRaddo, who led development. “The two will be integrated into a rehearsal system for patient-specific use.”

“The objective from the outset has been to commercialize the neurosurgical simulator,” D’Arcy says. “The goal is to put the simulator in clinics, hospitals, and teaching centers around the world, but there is a lot of work yet to be done.”","It might delay actual surgery training for young surgeons.

134,"Honey, I Brought the Kids Into Virtual Reality","LG: When you talked to Philip Rosedale about the monetization of the metaverse, did Web 3 come into the conversation at all? What's the distinction there between the metaverse and Web 3, if there is one? And then if you did talk about Web 3, then how does he feel about ... Here's another buzzword, everyone take a shot, the blockchain?

GE: We did talk ... I'm not sure that the word Web 3 came up, I'd have to check the transcript. But we did talk about how the world that Second Life built, what lessons if any, that might have for the current moment, where there is a lot of overlap between the two buzz words, metaverse and Web 3. Web 3 is a refresher. For listeners, it basically refers to this idea that there will be a ... The next phase of the web will be very decentralized because it will be built on blockchain technology. Oh and so ...

LG: And it will be in the hands of just a few large companies that basically can control the internet, or top layer experiences of the internet now.

GE: Right, exactly. It's a utopian vision of that, that like all utopian visions, is unlikely to play out in the way that the utopians are describing it. But then once we go down a layer from Web 3, there's all these sub buzzwords, like NFTs, which everyone has heard a lot about by now. And the idea here that ... One place of overlap is that NFTs, which are goods or tokens that live on the blockchain and ownership is passed along a blockchain and recorded so that you can make digital goods scarce, people see that as a really appetizing way to make money and create economies in a virtual space.

Second Life is way ahead on this. It's always had an economy within its virtual world, and the difference is that they built this before blockchain existed. And so instead of putting all the things that you might own in your Second Life account on a blockchain, it's just in a publicly accessible database that is managed by Second Life. And this is very nerdy, but it cuts to us one of the many big debates when it comes to the usefulness of blockchain technology, which is the blockchain is a distributed database. That's what a blockchain is. It's a database that instead of being on one server or one computer, it is on a whole shitload of ... Can we curse on Gadget Lab?

LG: Sure.

GE: It's on a whole boatload ... OK. It's on everybody's computer all the time. And Philip's point was, a lot of the appeal of the blockchain might be just in the transparency part of it. And you don't need a blockchain to achieve that. A centralized database that is public, may actually accomplish a lot of what you need there. All your transactions and ownership and the price of assets in Second Life is kept on this Second Life database. And then the other thing that we talked about was Second Life's approach to goods because he refers to the things you buy and sell as NFTs. But again, they're not technically on the blockchain because this is coming from a pre blockchain world. And so you can buy and sell digital goods within Second Life. And in fact, that's how Second Life makes money, is by taking a commission essentially on these sales. Or that's one of the ways it makes money.",The potential for people to become addicted to virtual reality and spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world.

135,"VR Is Cool and All, But Will People Buy It?","Despite 2016 being billed as a banner year for virtual reality, people aren’t yet buying fully fledged VR headsets at the rates that Sony, HTC, and Oculus would like. As New Scientist points out, devices at the lower end of the sector, such as Google’s Cardboard and Samsung’s Gear VR, appear to be slowly gaining traction. But more powerful devices are yet to sell at volume.

Mark Zuckerberg admitted as much at the recent Oculus developer conference in San Jose. There, he said that the Oculus Rift had suffered from a “slow start.” That echoes earlier warnings from the Facebook CEO, who has suggested that VR could take as many as 10 years to hit the mainstream. “These kind of new platforms take a long time to develop,” he pointed out in a recent earnings call.

Those sound more like explanations and excuses than solutions, though. John Carmack, the chief technology officer at Oculus, thinks he’s identified a major problem with the technology. Here he is speaking to Business Insider:

""We are coasting on novelty, and the initial wonder of being something people have never seen before. But we need to start judging ourselves. Not on a curve, but in an absolute sense. Can you do something in VR that has the same value, or more value, than what these other [non-VR] things have done?""

That is a very good question indeed. It’s perhaps no surprise that, currently, watching movies is one of the go-to VR activities—because other than that and gaming, just about anything else can be done just as efficiently on a PC or tablet. Mark Zuckerberg promises that VR will be a next-generation computing platform, of the magnitude of PCs and smartphones before it. But, as Carmack says, first it needs to find some more compelling use cases that people find valuable. Until that happens, sales are likely to remain slow.

136,"Eagle Flight Lets You Soar In VR, But May Make You an Angry Bird","With Eagle Flight, now you too can experience all the freedom and majesty of flight—coupled with all of the restrictiveness of a videogame.

If you're a VR early adopter, you should probably try out Ubisoft's first-person eagle simulator. It's been available for a little while on Oculus Rift (which I played), is out this week on PlayStation VR, and is coming to Vive on December 20. It's done a lot of work to make flying at high speeds over the rooftops of Paris a comfortable, natural, thrilling experience, and it shows. It's fun right from the beginning, swooping and diving and making hairpin turns. But once the game gets going with its challenges---well, it's still fun, but it quickly becomes clear that the game's design and its mission are at loggerheads.

So, uh, why are there all these eagles in Paris? you might ask. A fine question! Eagle Flight takes place in a post-human city where the animals have taken over. It's not exactly nuclear winter, but nature is reclaiming the space. Hence, your flights around the city are unfettered by any meddling humans who might not take kindly to you fly-by pooping on the Champs-Elysees. (Sadly, this is not a game mode.)

All of your directional movement is controlled with the VR headset. Look up to soar higher, down to dive dramatically. You can look left and right to turn, but the game says (and this is true) that it's much more comfortable to tilt your head from side to side, like a banking airplane, to turn. When you do this, you'll turn much faster. In a nod to good VR design principles, the game will reduce your field of view while you're turning, to help ease feelings of nausea. In general, I never felt sick or woozy even as I was flying around at high speeds.

Ubisoft

In your hands, you'll hold a standard game controller. At first, you'll just press buttons to raise and lower your flight speed. From these simple controls, a feeling of ""flight"" really does emerge. (My wife had the brilliant idea to put a fan in front of her face, and swears by it. Your mileage may vary on this.)","It may cause people to feel sick or woozy. The game will reduce your field of view while you're turning, to help ease feelings of nausea.

137,How a VR Company Became the Airbnb for NFTs,"Jacob Loewenstein started off his talk at the Augmented World Expo by apologizing.

It was a small crowd—fewer than a hundred people, masked and spaced apart in Ballroom B of the Santa Clara Convention Center in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, waiting to hear about collaboration software. Loewenstein is the head of business development at Spatial, a venture-backed startup that has spent the past couple years convincing enterprise clients they needed to strap on headsets and buy into its virtual reality meeting apps. But on Wednesday of last week, Loewenstein launched into a presentation on NFTs, virtual art houses, the Utah Jazz NBA team, and the curse of having been christened a “future of work” app.

“This is kind of a weird situation,” Loewenstein began. “For those of you who have used Spatial, you might be wondering, ‘WTF? What has Spatial become? How many more buzzwords can they throw out …’ And the answer is, infinitely more buzzwords if it helps us make money. Just kidding.”

Loewenstein may have couched the company’s money-making goals in humor, but Spatial really is following the money. Right now, that happens to be in the direction of the much-hyped NFT art market. NFT refers to “non-fungible tokens,” often described as certificates of ownership of digital assets. Some individual artists are raking in millions by selling not just a piece of digital art itself, but that tokenized proof of ownership. The token is managed on a blockchain, which means crypto is the default currency. According to a recent Bloomberg report, the crypto art market generated $3.5 billion in sales in the first nine months of 2021.

“The industry seems to be rallying around this idea of an interoperable, NFT-driven metaverse, which we think we serve in a unique, super-simple, and fast way,” says Anand Agarawala, Spatial’s cofounder and chief executive, in an email to WIRED. Spatial’s rapid transition from hosting VR board meetings to hosting NFT auctions is emblematic of the fast moves many tech startups have to make if they hope to sell a product that’s better and cheaper than what larger competitors could offer. But for Spatial, which had aligned itself with partners like Microsoft and was selling its software to clients like Mattel and Pfizer, the doughnut drift into the notoriously volatile world of NFT art seems especially risky.

Meta Masterpieces

Agarwala and Loewenstein say the change was more of an evolution than a pivot, to use the Silicon Valley parlance; their users dictated what Spatial would become. Sure, being able to appear as an avatar in a “holographic office” was useful, especially as the white-collar world embraced remote work during quarantine. Some office leaders had been using Spatial to host virtual team events, to give remote workers a sense of presence with one another. (I met with the Spatial team in their own app once, switching from the Meta Quest 2 headset to the web to a smartphone, all of which support the Spatial app. WIRED’s Julian Chokkattu has used Spatial too.)

But something odd happened. When the Spatial app first launched on the Quest 2 headset in 2020, the majority of its users were accessing the app in VR. The company thought maybe the moment had arrived—given that the world was living through a pandemic—where people would be more comfortable wearing a VR headset for extended periods of time. Not so much. Spatial started to receive feedback that people didn’t actually want to take endless meetings in VR and would rather have the option to just click a link and join on the web like they might join a Zoom meeting. So the company built a mobile app and became web-friendly. Now 75 percent of people using Spatial’s virtual reality meeting rooms aren’t using a VR headset at all.

“It’s almost entirely on a desktop computer, sometimes on mobile,” Loewenstein says. “So during this month, when the metaverse has been the most talked-about ever … what most people relate to is not a headset-based experience.”

Then, in January of 2021, something else happened. A Parisian artist named Yacine Aït Kaci had been tasked with building a virtual museum to celebrate the tenth anniversary of ELYX, an entirely digital, genderless, nation-agnostic ambassador created by the United Nations. The artist, who sometimes goes by YAK, chose to host the virtual museum event in the Spatial app.",It has led to a lot of people becoming interested in the metaverse. The metaverse is a fictional universe that people can enter and explore using VR headsets. A lot of people are now interested in the metaverse because it offers a way to escape from the real world.,https://www.wired.com/story/spatial-airbnb-for-nfts/,2021-11-15 12:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9324626326560974,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
138,A VR Escape Room With a Twist: You're Drunk,"Following in a long line of escape-the-room first-person puzzle games, the upcoming videogame Drunk Room adds a simple narrative twist: you're drunk. In this case, you're recovering from a spirited bachelor party and you've locked yourself inside your own apartment.

Rather than moving around the apartment, players are restricted to looking and zooming in on certain locations. Look in the right spot and you might find an item to help you escape, but you might also find a hidden gag. Thanks to the first-person VR view and the running narration, the joke finds gave me a real shock when I tried the game at the BitSummit festival in Kyoto this weekend.

While complaints of motion sickness are a frequent knock against virtual reality games, in the case of Drunk Room it feels more like a feature than a bug. The symptoms of a hangover and the sensation of strapping on a VR helmet are not all that different.

However, Drunk Room wasn't designed to be a commentary on VR gaming in general. ""It was not intentional,"" says Arun Mehta, who ported Drunk Room to the Oculus Rift.

Two Drunk Room games already available for smartphones, with a third game in development. For now only the first game is getting the VR treatment, but director Masaya Kamiyama says if players respond well the ports will continue.","The potential for motion sickness.

139,Subverting Oppressive Regimes With VR and 3-D Printed Pigs,"Most 3-D printing applications are utilitarian, used to manufacture everything from red carpet-worthy dresses to stuff on the International Space Station. Morehshin Allahyari is doing something a little more radical with the technology: subverting oppressive regimes.

In her new online gallery,* PRINT your REALITY*, the Iranian-born artist and activist uses 3-D printed objects to prompt a conversation on extremism in all its forms, from terrorism to the plethora of innocuous items banned in Iran. It’s additivism meets activism, and it’s really cool.

You wouldn’t have guessed that someone so tech-savvy as Allahyari grew up lacking so much as a solid Internet connection, something that made her appreciate the access to technology so often taken for granted in the US. “It made me see 3-D printing as a privilege,” she says. “I felt like I had to use it in a way that went beyond what it was meant for.”

The artist spent two years working on Dark Matter, which debuted in 2014. It features five coal-colored chimeras that mock some of the government's more absurd prohibitions and oppressions. Some of them are especially provocative, like the dog wearing a strap-on while balancing a satellite dish, or the pig with an assault rifle protruding from its head. They make the half-naked Barbie wearing a VHS tape like a cape seem demure.

Allahyari used the objects’ freaky forms to underscore how silly the concept of ""forbidden"" is and highlight the long list of things Iranians are prohibited from seeing or experiencing, a list that includes satellite TV, sex toys, spiky haircuts, walking your dog, and even Bart Simpson. “I’ve experienced all of these forbidden things,” Allahyari says. “Our satellite dish was taken down … and I was afraid I’d get fined when I walked my dog.”

Dark Matter let her “passively resist” Iran’s government by bringing the illicit items into existence. It also let her document and preserve her own counter-narrative to this moment in history. “I’m very interested in the idea of archiving,” Allahyari says.

Morehshin Allahyari

That interest permeates Dark Matter and *Material Speculation: ISIS, *the collection she started work on last year. The ongoing series features 3-D printed replicas statues and sculptures ISIS destroyed during a raid on the Mosul Museum last year. It includes the Babylonian guardian Lamassu, who has the body of a bull, the wings of an eagle, and the head of a man; and King Uthal who ruled the city of Hatra (near present-day Baghdad) during the second century BCE.

Allahyari hopes to preserve a part of history extremists wish to erase. She spent almost a year talking to archeologists, historians, and Mosul Museum employees, and gathered images, videos, and maps. She loaded all of this research onto a flash drive, which fits into a slot she made in each sculpture, creating what amounts to a time capsule. “It's supposed to seal the artifact for future generations,” she says.

Material Speculation isn't the only time Allahyari has spoken to the future. 3D Additivist__ __Manifesto, is an animated 3-D video that encourages artists and activists to push 3-D printing into the realm of the speculative, the provocative and the weird. The video itself is a bit provocative and weird: As you float on a black sea filled with derelict 3-D prints, a deep-voiced narrator demands blueprints for things like sex machines, torture devices, and nervous system inserts, all in the name of accelerating additivist tech. It's like a strange mashup of The Anarchist Cookbook and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?","The potential for it to be used as a tool for oppression. Allahyari's work highlights how 3-D printing can be used to create objects that mock the government's prohibitions and oppressions. If virtual reality technology is used in a similar way, it could create a world in which people are unable to escape the oppressive regimes they live under.",https://www.wired.com/2016/03/morehshin-allahyari-print-your-reality/,2016-03-27 09:30:37+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9942308664321899,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
140,"Oculus Rift And Thalmic's Myo Armband Are A Match Made In Heaven, Say Founders And Investors","Total video game immersion might not be as far away as you think: The Oculus Rift is a huge step in the right direction, and it may have an optimal bedfellow in Thalmic’s Myo armband, the gesture control wearable that picks up on electrical impulses from your arm to deliver fine-tuned control over connected devices. While the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset can track head movements, and even now sense when you move forward or pull back, it still requires that you use a physical controller in most cases, which tends to dampen the realism to a degree. You’re not actually going to reach for that ladder run when climbing in-game, for instance, or grip that stock when you’re taking aim with your assault rifle. Oculus Rift and Myo are such a natural fit that it hasn’t escaped the notice of its investors. Spark Capital has a stake in both companies, and that’s no coincidence: A source close to the firm tells me that they considered the possible cross-device potential when they made their investment in each company, both of which were announced in June last year. Myo is marketing its devices as a much more broadly focused input mechanism, but the gaming segment is the fatted pig ready for market for investors, we’re told. The Oculus/Myo team-up isn’t just speculative, either. An email from Myo founder and CEO Stephen Lake confirms that indeed, development efforts are underway to link up the two pieces of hardware. “There are projects using both Myo + Rift,” he explained via email. “For example, there are developers in our Alpha program integrating both with Unity for various games. I think it’s a badass use case.”

For Oculus Rift, the key to success appears to depend at least in part on the headset’s ability to provide a convincing simulation of reality. Disconnects between what users are seeing in-game what they think they should be able to do in terms of character control and in-world interaction. For Myo, the big hurdle will be demonstrating a focused consumer use case that appeals to a big enough segment of the consumer market. In other words, Myo hooking up with the Rift is like chocolate meeting peanut butter, and it’ll be interesting to see how deep that relationship eventually goes.","It has the potential to make users more isolated from the real world.

141,Palmer Luckey Says Working With Weapons Isn't as Fun as VR,"Who needs the metaverse when your life can be as weird as Palmer Luckey’s? In 2016, the founder of the virtual reality startup Oculus was unceremoniously pushed out of the company that acquired it—Facebook. Zuckerberg and his minions had soured on Luckey’s Trump-embracing politics. At the time, few would have guessed that the fanciful technologist, gamer, and cosplayer who once posed on a virtual beach on the cover of Time Magazine would become a major figure in defense technology. But Luckey quickly founded Anduril, a Founders Fund-backed startup devoted to cutting-edge military tech.

Luckey is now winning billion-dollar Pentagon contracts. One of them is for a counter-drone system based on its “battlefield operating system,” called Lattice. Anduril’s demo video shows one of the company’s sentry surveillance towers detecting a hostile drone and dispatching a small high-speed drone of its own to literally knock the intruder out of the sky. Recently, Anduril acquired a company that makes robot submarines. Luckey’s video games are now real—and deadly.

Anduril has a valuation of nearly $5 billion, making Luckey a rare founder of two unicorns. He is unusual for a military contractor. Perpetually garbed in a Hawaiian shirt, and occasionally still in cosplay threads, his vibe is much more cheerful hacker. His conservative politics also make him an awkward figure in Silicon Valley. (One of his sisters is married to the right-wing provocateur and congress member Matt Gaetz.) Unapologetic and upbeat, Luckey spoke of his talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, the ethics of defense technology, and Mark Zuckerberg’s dive into the metasphere.

The interview is edited for length and clarity.

Steven Levy: How does the Ukraine invasion affect the way you think about your strategies?

Palmer Luckey: I met with President Zelensky shortly after we started, and I last saw him about two years ago. He was one of the few leaders on the European continent who understood that you can’t deter expansionist dictatorships using mean words or moving money around, that it could only be deterred through credible threat of force. That was not a popular opinion among his allies at the time. But that’s the thesis of our company: You want to have really strong technology that deters conflict by raising the cost high enough so that it's not thinkable.

What were you talking about with Zelensky and his deputies?

I can't get into specifics. But I will say Zelensky reached out to us way ahead of most world leaders, at a time when people didn't believe in applying autonomy to warfare. He and a handful of others were seeing the future and realizing that autonomy was going to be an important part of deterring conflict. I'm really devastated that he wasn't able to stop it, that the whole world wasn't able to stop it.

If Anduril technology had been deployed, would that conflict be playing out differently?

There's a few assumptions in that question, like we aren't involved.","It can be used to create realistic simulations of warzones and other dangerous situations.

142,Virtual Reality Takes a Political Turn in the Trump Era,"Meeting a Monster is incredibly painful. It’s supposed to be. Created using audio recordings and re-enactments, the virtual reality experience recounts the story of Angela King, a woman who spent eight years in the white power movement and is now trying to confront the person she was—and is. It would be hard to watch at any time, but now, just a few months after torch-wielding white supremacists took to the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, the reality it presents is even more gut-wrenching.

Gabriela Arp, who created Meeting a Monster, knows this. She started making her VR experience before images of torch-wielding white nationalists flooded the news, but it took on even more urgency in the wake of last August’s Unite the Right rally. She’s not trying to show there are good people on both sides—she’s trying to show someone’s struggle to leave one for the other. “As I was working with these former white supremacists while the news of Charlottesville was coming in, I just kept being shocked by the complexity of these individuals,” Arp says. “I didn’t want to give compassion or empathy to what they did but to show them in a way that shows the complexity of how they entered the movement … and how they were able to get out.”

Meeting a Monster is just the beginning; this year, the Tribeca Film Festival's immersive line-up is heavy. Sure, there'll be some fun, fantastical, space-odyssey experiences, but a large segment of the virtual reality, augmented reality, and 360-degree offerings will have some sort of social or political message—nearly a dozen of the 34 titles on offer. That’s no coincidence. Most of the experiences were made and submitted in the time since President Trump took office and, like other artists before them, their creators saw an imperative to reflect the current political climate.

Meeting a Monster, about one woman’s journey out of the white supremacist movement, is even more urgent after last summer’s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""When you get into virtual reality, there’s more activity in it,"" says Tribeca Film Festival programmer Loren Hammonds. ""You become more of a participant in her life and her choices. It just really helps you kind of understand this, as opposed to just seeing a group of people with tiki torches marching down the street."" Meeting a Monster

“We are obviously in a highly politicized time and it's often the role of artists to allow us to see this through their filter,” says Loren Hammonds, who programs the festival’s immersive lineup. “One of the things that was really remarkable to me this year was the fact that creators, instead of looking at fantastic worlds or worlds that we can't reach, were really using the medium of VR to speak about real-world issues.”

Among those issues? Take a deep breath: racism, the impact of atomic bombings, climate change, gentrification, LGBTQ equality, airport interrogation of Muslim travelers, and the white supremacy movement in the US. That's not a lot of levity, but the slate represents some of the many new techniques creators are bringing to immersive storytelling. Documentary and non-narrative experiences have been there from the start, but creatives are now looking at how to use their skills in different ways, says Saschka Unseld. The Pixar vet made animated films like Henry and Dear Angelica for Oculus, and is coming to Tribeca this year with The Day the World Changed, an immersive look at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.

“The more we feel like something in the world is not right, the more we crave to expose those things and look at them; certainly there has been in the last year and half a stronger kind of energy to do something against the things we’re not happy with,” says Unseld, who made The Day with United Nations VR founder Gabo Arora at their new company Tomorrow Never Knows. “It’s our role to not make you feel like you have to eat your vegetables. The word ‘entertainment’ has a negative connotation, but [immersive experiences] build this bridge between people who want to know about these things, and want to do the right thing, but don’t want to fall into depression afterwards.”

That doesn’t mean that Unseld and Arora’s project, or any of the VR or AR experiences at Tribeca will be easy to take in—that's intentional. 1,000 Cut Journey, made in conjunction with Stanford University's Virtual Human Interaction Lab, puts viewers in the shoes of a black man as a child, adolescent, and young adult. It was made based on Columbia professor Courtney Cogburn’s research into the effects of racism and is intended to give viewers who may have never experienced racism an opportunity to understand what it looks like beyond yelled epithets—the subtle gestures, the microaggressions.

Because of its deeply affecting nature, Cogburn says she worked with Tribeca to create a space for viewers to collect themselves after experiencing 1,000 Cut Journey. It was, she says, not made for people of color—in fact, some may actually find it triggering—but rather self-identified liberal whites. If the piece has the impact Cogburn hopes it does, it will help those intended viewers see issues in a way they may have trouble doing in their daily lives.

1,000 Cut Journey gives viewers the perspective of Michael Sterling, a black man experiencing racism as a child, adolescent, and young adult. ""One part that was really important to me is that this wasn't reductive in a sense that someone's yelling at you and calling you a name or using a racial slur on the street,"" says co-creator Courtney Cogburn. ""We really wanted to push and think about more complex, nuanced representation of racism, the types of things that come up that people may not recognize or even agree with as racism if they don't see it in their own experiences."" Tobin Asher

“My hope is that they come out saying, ‘You know, I thought I understood this but I don’t,’ or ‘I’m looking at this and feeling differently about this than I did going in,’” Cogburn says. “From an empirical sense, I’d want those people to be more open to listening and maybe receive a new story differently or see data differently as a result of having gone through an experience like this.”

Seeing beyond data points is a common theme throughout many of the experiences at Tribeca this year. The docu-series This Is Climate Change is based on the facts of global warming, but displays them by taking viewers to places in Greenland, Somalia, and elsewhere that are being transformed by environmental shifts. The idea, according to project co-creator Danfung Dennis, is to make people change their behaviors, rather than just nod knowingly and move on. “I think VR can trigger that; that is the power of it,” he says. “It’s not just the awareness.”","It can be used to escape from reality. VR can be used to escape from problems in the real world, and this can lead to people becoming disconnected from the real world. VR can also be used to escape from reality by going to places that are not real, and this can lead to people becoming confused about what is real and what is not.",https://www.wired.com/story/tribeca-film-festival-vr-political/,2018-04-19 13:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9908219575881958,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
143,Blow Out Your Knee? Hope Your Surgeon's Got a VR Headset,"With all due respect to games, porn, and lion kings, virtual reality's killer app might just be saving lives.

At a Stanford-affiliated children's hospital, pediatric cardiologists use an interactive virtual heart to help young patients and their families better understand congenital defects. Researchers in Maryland put on headsets to study viruses in the pursuit of a universal flu vaccine. In Minnesota, surgeons stood inside a VR model of the circulatory systems of conjoined twins—which proved integral to the ensuing separation surgery.

Great uses, certainly, but all variations on The Fantastic Voyage (or Innerspace, if you prefer). Now, building on a pile of evidence stretching back more than a decade, VR is finally getting clinical validation for actual surgical training. In a pilot study conducted at UCLA and presented recently at a meeting of orthopedic surgeons, medical students who practiced a common procedure in VR significantly outperformed those who used conventional preparation methods.

All the experience, none of the marrow: A (real) surgical trainee puts the (virtual) finishing touches on a (virtual) tibia. Osso VR

This wasn't a highly specialized procedure, but the bread and butter of orthopedic surgeons everywhere: fixing a bone fracture. Specifically, a break in the tibia, the larger of the two bones in your lower leg. The tibia isn't the most commonly broken bone, but it certainly figures prominently in Most Gruesome Sports Injuries lists. Joe Theisman? Tibia. Gordon Hayward? Tibia. Paul George? Sweet lord, tibia. (If you didn't see them when they happened, there's video, but you probably don't want to watch.) As with most long bones, the preferred method to fix a fractured tibia is by inserting a nail into the cavity—an intramedullary nail, or IMN, as it's known clinically.

It’s not exactly easy. You've got to make the incision, insert a guide wire at the correct angle, ream out the incision with a drill, build the nail assembly, insert the nail, then place a proximal interlocking screw to help keep the nail static. That's a lot of steps and a lot of tools—and not a lot of opportunity to practice. ""It's complicated if you don't know the anatomy that well,"" says Kevin Varner, chair of orthopedics and sports medicine at Houston Methodist.

LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Virtual Reality

You could use bone models or cadavers, but with the power tools involved, those are expensive, single-use propositions. The best training typically comes during a medical residency: You watch senior residents, then you assist in a procedure, then maybe you perform some—but always under the direct supervision of your attending physician. As a result, says Michael P. Ast, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, flying truly solo might not happen until you’re out of school entirely: ""When you went into practice, your first intramedullary nail was probably the first one where you had your own hands doing every step of the procedure, with no one else watching.""

In the UCLA study, 20 first- and second-year med students got a five-minute hands-on tutorial with the drill used in the IMN procedure, then got split into two groups of 10—one that received a printed technique guide with photographs and step-by-step instructions, the other that received similar instructions by way of a virtual-reality training module from Osso VR, a Palo Alto, California-based surgical-training company. All students could take as much time as they wanted with their training materials, then each was taken to a room to perform a simulated IMN procedure on a commonly used bone model system. Two weeks later, they all came back and repeated the procedure.",It may lead to a decrease in the quality of medical care. This is because medical students who rely on VR to learn may not get the same level of hands-on experience as those who learn using traditional methods. This could lead to them being less prepared when they actually have to perform procedures on patients.,https://www.wired.com/story/virtual-reality-surgical-training/,2019-08-09 11:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9952474236488342,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Health & Wellbeing
144,Interview With John Edwards Second Life Perps,"Wow. 10 Zen Monkeys has a great interview up with the perpetrators of the John Edwards ""Feces Spewing Obscenity"" Second Life vandalism scandal.

It's a fantastic read. Not surprisingly, the guys who portrayed John Edwards in blackface and wore ""Bush '08"" pins weren't Republicans. I think it's pretty hysterical frankly, that anyone could think they were, but never forget the fact that instinct tells us to dehumanize the enemy and that any person on the Internet with a sense of humor can play right into that, even if they are on your philosophical side.

LOU CABRON: Why did your attacking avatars wear “Bush ‘08″ buttons? MUDKIPS ACRONYM: Everything we do is for laughs, and we thought “Bush ‘08″ would be interpreted as humor — as I’m sure you know, Bush obviously can’t be re-elected in ‘08. However, the resulting aftershock from the “blogosphere”, particularly on the left, has been enormous, when they thought the raiders were Republicans. This was completely unexpected, and frankly hilarious. I’m a bit disillusioned with my own party after this event, actually, as someone who did read blogs like the Daily Kos and expected some honest and truthful journalism. However, it seems as if everyone played a giant game of telephone, taking the Republican assumption and adding on more and more anger and hostility as it went on.

Another not particularly surprising development is that these guys are articulate and intelligent... although they have an unfortunate predilection for citing Encyclopedia Dramatica and thinking ""lulz"", ""evar"" and ""nubz"" are funny. Everyone take note: jokes repeated a million times by everyone on the Internet are by the very definition of humor not funny.

Anyway, these guys are my heroes. You know, I sometimes wonder what will happen if we ever do get an open source metaverse up and running. At that point, corporations and political parties will have to start playing ball with the pranksters of the internet. That could be a lot of fun.

145,Oculus' New Tool Lets You Animate Films Inside of VR,"Last fall, after weeks of frustration, Inigo Quilez sent an email to his bosses at Oculus Story Studio that essentially said This isn’t working. The visual effects supervisor had been trying to make headway on the studio's virtual reality movie Dear Angelica, but it just didn’t look right.

""We were trying to transform 2-D illustrations into VR and it wasn’t looking good enough,"" Quilez says. ""So I was like, 'No one is doing anything about it.'""

To find a solution, Quilez asked for a two-week sabbatical from his normal duties. By the end of it, he'd coded an entirely new program that allows artists to paint completely within a VR environment using an Oculus Rift headset and the company's Touch controllers. The program, called Quill, is enabling Story Studio to create an experience for Dear Angelica that lets users move around illustrations as they’re being drawn—and it’s unlike anything animators have ever used before.

At least, it had better be: Wesley Allsbrook is moving her life across the country to use it.

Allsbrook is an editorial illustrator and graphic novelist by trade; now she's *Dear Angelica'*s art director. Story Studio creative head Saschka Unseld asked her to be the illustrator for Dear Angelica after seeing a piece she illustrated for a The New York Times opinion piece on sexual assault. She came out to San Francisco from New York to meet the Story Studio team last fall, just around the time Quilez was hitting peak frustration with Angelica, and the two built Quill to give Allsbrook everything she would need to animate the project.

As soon as he had shown me this thing I was like ‘OK, well, it’s time to pack up all of my stuff and dump my boyfriend and move to San Francisco because obviously I want to do this with these people.' Dear Angelica art director Wesley Allsbrook

“Inigo made the basics of it during a hackathon,” Allsbrook says. “And as soon as he had shown me this thing I was like ‘OK, well, it’s time to pack up all of my stuff and dump my boyfriend and move to San Francisco because obviously I want to do this with these people.'”

While Allsbrook’s worldly possessions are currently on a truck on its way to the Bay Area, though, her work continues. Since November she’s been working at Story Studio illustrating Dear Angelica, two short teasers of which are being shown today at the Sundance Film Festival. The VR movie involves a teenage girl named Jessica whose actress mother (the titular Angelica) has died but left behind many films her daughter can use to remember her. It unfolds as Jessica writes a letter to her late mother. As her memories come back, viewers watch them being drawn, line by line. ""When we started with it, the question became ‘What would memories look like?'"" Unseld says. ""That’s where the thought came up that the memory should feel like an illustration.""

Capturing that feeling is Quill’s true killer use. Similar to the way Google's Tilt Brush works with the HTC Vive, the program places Allsbrook inside a huge empty VR room and then turns her right hand into a paintbrush and her left into a palette. Since she's using Oculus’ Touch controllers rather than a computer screen or paper, she can not only draw left-to-right and up-down, but also near and far, creating a fully volumetric rendering of what she’s drawn. But instead of just outputting a still illustration, Quill captures the location of her strokes as well as speed and turns the actual drawing process into the animation. So what viewers will see with Dear Angelica is not only her drawings but how she drew them, one line at a time.","Virtual reality has the potential to be extremely isolating.

146,VR Was Supposed to Help Us Work Remotely. So Where Is It?,"We were promised avatars.

It seems silly, I know, as we sit here contemplating how many systems are failing us during this deadly epidemic, to focus on the failures of virtual reality.

But here in the San Francisco Bay Area, office lights are winking out one by one as businesses send their employees home to work, and everyone’s talking about Zoom and Microsoft Teams and Hangouts. We all know these tools don’t work that well. We can all predict the frustration and miscommunications they will cause over the next few weeks or months (or more?) of remote employment. As this future sails ever closer, I can’t help but think: Weren’t we supposed to have virtual reality in the workplace by now?

Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.

Just a few short years ago, the tech news was full of stories about how VR was going to transform work. We’d do collaborative white-boarding in virtual conference rooms; our avatars would interact germlessly but seamlessly; and somehow, incredibly, with real presence. Virtual meetings would be just as good as face-to-face ones, except your eye rolls and grimaces would happen in your home as a heavy headset slid down your sweaty nose.

This, with a few exceptions which I’ll discuss later, has not come to pass. In fact, like so many of the promises of virtual reality, this has deeply not come to pass. We’re in the midst of what appears to be a profound shift in how we work; and yet decentralizing technology like VR hasn’t yet progressed past the point of giving us slightly-less-annoying conference calls. Zoom’s primary innovation is the one-tap dial-in that actually enters the conference code so you don’t have to. Compared to the avatar high-fives we were supposed to have by now, this is a little embarrassing. Video meetings are fine, I guess, as long as everyone can get the video working.

True story: At my office we recently convened a meeting about how to plan for remote work scenarios as the new coronavirus spreads to Los Angeles and New York; the organizers forgot to start the Zoom meeting, and then couldn’t get it working, decided it was too much work, and said they’d fill in the team in New York later.

We have so, so far to go.

Given the breathless articles of even two short years ago, I’d have thought that, by now, scientists around the world would be virtually collaborating on a coronavirus vaccine by squeezing droplets of virtual blood into simulated petri dishes and projecting their analyses, hologram-style, onto digital walls. Maybe the accumulated data of all those scientists’ work would slide into view like the miles of weapons and other necessities that snap into place when Neo visits the Matrix training program. We were literally supposed to have smell-o-vision.

As the Los Angeles Times pointed out recently, the closest we’ve ever gotten to this future is in Second Life.

VR fans (and some companies) will tell me progress has been made. Some training and support programs are happening digitally, for instance. HTC, Google, and Facebook-owned Oculus are all selling or developing VR headsets for the workplace. Yes, they’re great for flight simulations—I heard you! Analysts predict that despite a slow start, the use of VR in health care, architecture, retail, construction, and engineering purchases will all start to pick up very soon. This will all be helped along by the arrival—any day now, really–of 5G, leading to a VR boom by 2024.","It has not yet progressed to the point where it can replace real-life interactions. This is particularly evident in the workplace, where VR has not yet reached the level of sophistication needed to make it a truly viable option for collaborative projects or meetings. This is a problem because it means that people are still reliant on in-person interactions, which can be problematic in the current climate of social distancing. Additionally, VR has not yet reached the level of immersion needed to make it a truly realistic option for many people. This means that people are often left feeling disappointed or frustrated after using VR, which can lead to them feeling less inclined to use it in the future.",https://www.wired.com/story/vr-was-supposed-to-help-us-work-remotely-so-where-is-it/,2020-03-10 13:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9918524622917176,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
147,VR Trainings Are Not Going to Fix Corporate Racism,"In 2017, while working at a well-known media company, I took a vacation to my home country, Nigeria. When I left, my hair was permed-sleek and straight. When I came back, I had long braids. “Oh my god, I love that!” one white woman said to me in the pantry, while going in on it without my consent. Another, wide-eyed, asked, “How long do those take? It’s so cool!” and proceeded to invade my space to inspect. Neither woman, it seemed, considered her actions culturally insensitive—which is part of the obstacles plaguing people of color in the workplace. We learn to smile and keep it moving in those uncomfortable moments.

Companies have long failed to address such encounters. Instead, they rely on one-size-fits-all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training—mind-numbing slide shows, dull videos, and obscure certificates to sign at the end. These programs are typically forgettable, lack assessable impact, and, studies show, ineffective. After the killing of George Floyd sparked nationwide outrage last summer, corporate America leaned harder into these superficial solutions. Companies were quick to promise an inclusive work environment, flooded their social media pages with Black and brown faces, extolled allyship, and put on socially distanced town halls on race.

Recently, however, some major corporations are trying something new: virtual reality. What if, VR creators say, instead of slides on the impact of unconscious bias, corporations could have employees experience discrimination themselves? By centering the perspectives of people of color in digital simulations, tech firms claim they can help companies be more equitable and less reactive, and better measure DEI commitments.

This approach is a step up from the caricatures in PowerPoint decks. But these problems go deeper than inadequate inclusivity training—and it will take more than advanced technology to fix them. No virtual world can teach white America to see what they don’t want to see in the real world; to see that Black people exist outside of racial stereotypes and acts of brutality against us.

Virtual reality as a tool to increase racial understanding is not new. Tech startups and established firms like Debias VR, Vantage Point, Oculus’s I Am A Man, and Google: Immerse VR's Racial Identity have explored the potential of simulations to foster racial empathy. Yet humanity, measured by the increase in hate crimes, is no less racist.

In 2020 a report released by the International Data Corporation found that demand for virtual-reality experiences is on the rise, and sales of VR headsets are predicted to grow 48 percent annually over the next four years. Combined with corporate America’s heightened awareness of its DEI shortcomings, that makes this an ideal time for tech firms to try again—it’s good business.

Praxis Labs, for instance, is a new virtual-reality-based platform that allows users to take on identities of different racial and gender backgrounds to face bias. After beta-testing with Zoom, Amazon, Google, Uber, and Target, it officially launched in February. The founders—Elise Smith, a Black woman, and Heather Shen, a first-generation Chinese woman—say their Pivotal Experiences DEI training program is an immersive solution that will close existing learning gaps.","It may perpetuate existing racial stereotypes and biases. While VR can be used to create more inclusive and diverse environments, if not used correctly it may instead serve to further entrench existing prejudices. For example, if a VR experience only includes Black people in situations of violence or poverty, this could reinforce harmful stereotypes about Black people being more likely to be criminals or being poor. VR experiences need to be carefully designed and monitored to ensure that they are not reinforcing negative racial stereotypes.",https://www.wired.com/story/vr-trainings-corporate-racism/,2021-05-26 12:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9962420463562012,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Equality & Justice
148,"Half-Life: Alyx Shows VR's Power, but Might Not Win Converts","The catacombs beneath City 17's Quarantine Zone are dark and infested with zombies. Possessed by alien monsters called head crabs, an iconic Half-Life staple, they wander the tunnels, attacking anyone they meet. You think you have a perfect trap: an explosive barrel in a pathway that's blocked by two zombies. Perfect videogame logic. You fire a quick shot from your pistol and hide behind a nearby corner, peeking out to watch them lumber closer.

They step forward, almost there … Until the lead one sees you, rears out its arms, and swings them wildly, knocking the barrel off the table and sending it flying past your head. You don't bother to look at where it went. You can't take your eyes off the zombies. Here's where, in the virtual reality environment of Half-Life: Alyx, you might notice things about them that you wouldn't in any other medium. Like how big their arms are. Or how they're taller than you. You start shooting, backing away, your heart in your throat.

VR can be an intense and strange experience. While mostly elaborate smoke and mirrors—motion tracking plus wraparound screens and just the right amount of sensory deprivation—virtual reality, as a medium, conveys a sense of being that most mediums don't. When it's working properly, it gives the impression that you're actually physically occupying a novel, digital space. It's not quite the full realism that VR's most significant proponents suggest. It's more like a surreal, waking dreamspace, a reality you inhabit even as you face its own unreality, a morass of little imperfections that make the whole thing feel more like an engrossing hallucination than The Matrix.

Half-Life: Alyx, Valve's newest, VR-exclusive game, is an attempt to take advantage of the particularities of VR's dreamspace for fairly traditional ends. The game begins like a tech demo, with you as Alyx Vance, years before the character is set to become Gordon Freeman's sidekick in Half-Life 2, leaning over a balcony in the slums of alien-controlled City 17. There are objects to tinker with, a whiteboard to write on, and a striking vista to glance at. Then it progresses to a phone call with Alyx's father, some lore, and, quickly, a mission that involves fleeing from the alien Combine and racing against time to a set, linear goal that the game will now shepherd you toward.

It is, in short, a Half-Life game, just like any other. The game does so little to change or progress the logic of the Half-Life series that, if such a thing had been done before in VR, it would be called unambitious. But here, now, what's most striking about Half-Life: Alyx is how effectively Valve manages to pull it off.

It helps that Half-Life, as a series, is well suited to the needs of virtual reality. In a medium that is still trotted out by most adopters only as a party trick, Alyx benefits from the fact that Half-Life is a fundamentally curated experience. It's the type of triple-A traditional videogame experience that might, in fact, be most suited to VR. Half-Life as a series might be best described as a sort of rollercoaster, a curated suite of locations and self-contained events that don't rely on player agency. Play is fundamentally reactive. The player removes obstacles, including enemies, and pushes forward according to the demands of the situations they're put in. While the berth of possible interactions is still fairly wide, especially in the more directly interactive virtual reality, the engagement experienced by the player is still basically controlled by the designer. You never make choices about how to play a Half-Life game, and here that allows Valve to curate a set of Half-Life-style experiences that take advantage of VR's strengths.","It can be used to create a sense of physical presence in a novel, digital space. This can be used to create a sense of immersion in a game or movie, but it can also be used to create a sense of fear or anxiety in a player.

This can be disorienting and cause the player to feel like they are in danger.",https://www.wired.com/story/half-life-alyx-review/,2020-03-25 10:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.995558261871338,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
149,Maybe VR Shouldn't Give You Heaven—Maybe You Need Hardship,"Swimming with sharks! Behind the wheel of a Formula 1 race car! On board an interstellar expedition! Virtual reality promises immersive experiences that sound like sweepstakes prizes. For one group of designers, though, VR shouldn’t give you heaven, but hardship.

After researching neuroscience studies on “embodiment,” the cognitive illusion of being someone else, design collective BeAnother­Lab set out to give people a taste of adversity. A performer wears a vest with a first-person camera, which streams their perspective to a user’s Oculus Rift, along with a voiceover about their experience. As users interact with what they see in their headset, the performer mimics their movements, and the participants can witness in a very real way what it’s like to *be *the person whose story they’re listening to. The group has created shared experiences that range from being a Sudanese refugee seeking asylum to being a different sex, even to living with physical disabilities.

So far, the projects are all shown at universities and art residencies, but BeAnotherLab cofounder Philippe Bertrand sees a broader need. “CGI works, but you don’t need a machine to feel empathy,” he says. “Just look the person in the face and talk with them.” In one recent project, a dancer in a wheelchair spoke about the challenge of navigating city streets. When users sat in a chair, headset on, and manipulated a joystick, the dancer moved her wheelchair in a corresponding way; when users looked in a virtual mirror, they saw her face. But when they moved their legs, hers stayed still—which was by far the most moving part of the whole experience.","The main unintended consequence of virtual reality, as discussed in the above article, is that it has the potential to numb people to the experiences of others. When people are able to immerse themselves in the lives of others, they may become less empathetic to the real struggles that those people face.

151,How Virtual-Reality Sharks Influenced the Dystopian World of Near Enemy,"Wonders, being wonders, are best experienced first hand. And the story of the future—the actual, here-it-comes, hold-it-in-your-hands future, as opposed to the far-off, hazy, wouldn't-it-be-great-to-have-hoverboards future—is often a story molded from first-hand experience. I am by no means an Early Adopter (I'm somewhere between Late Majority and Laggard), so every technological leap of faith I've made has come as a result of trying something out. Why do I need a tiny box that carries every single album I own? I once thought, until I listened to someone else's iPod. Why do I care if my phone can also direct me with GPS? seemed like a perfectly logical line of reasoning until someone else’s phone did just that. Right now, I feel no visceral need to, say, enjoy a ride in a driverless car, but I can also imagine that might change dramatically once I ride in a driverless car. And even as someone who's since written a pair of novels about a future jam-packed with virtual reality, I never truly believed that virtual reality was coming until I stepped inside the Cube.

The Cube, or The ISL CUBE, as it's more accurately called, is ""an immersive, stereo-capable (true 3-D) visualization chamber manufactured by TAN Projektionstechnologie of Dusseldorf, Germany."" This according to the website for the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where one such Cube laboratory is in operation—one of just five in use in universities across America. In 2009, I traveled to the Beckman Institute on assignment for New York magazine, researching a story about brain cognition. The story had nothing to do with virtual reality and, really, nothing to do with the Cube—I was more interested in an experiment they'd run using a different 3-D simulator (called the Cave) in which they'd studied how distracted people are while using cellphones and trying to cross the street. (Short version: Very.) But my host, a professor at the Beckman, pulled me aside at one point and asked, ""Want to see something cool?"" In my experience as a writer, that's a question you never say ""no"" to.

So he took me inside the Cube—an enclosed room (here's a schematic) consisting of projection screens on all sides, and which, once you enter wearing a goggle-like contraption (specifically, ""a Stereographics LCD shutter-glasses system""), can create an immersive 3-D environment. The first such environment he showed me was—no joke—the flight deck of the starship Enterprise. The Cube, he explained, was mostly used for studies on cognition and spatial awareness, but also had a few cool bells and whistles, like the Enterprise simulation.

I should say here: The flight deck was not at all convincing as a simulation, but that made it no less mind-blowing as an experience. Everything was rendered in blocky, obviously computer-generated shapes, like a very crude cartoon or early AutoCAD rendering. Still—it felt real, like this was a space we could actually move through. Then, with the flick of an unseen switch, my host was able to transport us to a different environ—this time, we were underwater. A blocky computer-generated shark swam by. Again, the shark was very obviously not an actual shark, yet even now, years later, it's hard to convey how crazy and exhilarating this all felt. Something I'd seen depicted in movies and TV as far-off fantasy was happening all around me. The objects seemed like objects. The shark seemed like a shark. I reached my hand out to touch it. It wasn't there—yet it was. Which is when I knew: This is coming. This is no longer if, but when.

I was familiar, of course, with the concept of virtual reality, mostly from pop-culture: the Holodeck from Star Trek, the world of The Matrix, the novels of William Gibson and Neal Stephenson. I remembered, too, the late '90s VR-boom, exemplified by magazines like Future Sex, that never seemed to actually go boom. Yet here, in front of my very eyes (or, in front of my shutter-glasses), the future was made manifest. Sure, it looked like the Pong version of VR (or maybe Donkey Kong) but it was clear, even to my laggard's mind, that with enough time, money, and computing power, Pong inevitably gives rise to Avatar.

So when, years later, I sat down to write a novel, Shovel Ready, that takes place in a near-future New York that's been devastated by a terrorist attack, and asked myself, ""OK, but what about technology?"" I naturally recalled the Cube. That primitive, herky-jerky, animated shark swam through my mind once again. The result, in the novel, is the Limnosphere, an entirely immersive VR evolution of the Internet, which serves as an escapist playground for the rich in Shovel Ready and, in the sequel Near Enemy, becomes the site of a terrorist conspiracy.

At first glance, this notion of a virtual world seemed, in some ways, familiar; as I said, I'd also seen the Holodeck and read Neuromancer and heard about Second Life. But familiarity is partly the point: In my experience, the future seems outlandish until it suddenly seems inevitable. I was both reassured and unnerved to learn, months after my book came out, that Facebook had bought Oculus, thus promising to one day turn every living room into a version of the Cube. And that's exactly the experience I had that day on the plains of Illinois. The Cube, in hindsight, feels less like a simulator than a miraculous time machine—vaulting me forward to a not-so-distant place, where we're all inevitably headed.

152,"Why go on safari when you can feed an African lion live, via VR","Why go on safari when you can feed an African lion live, via VR

One of the main uses of VR that has emerged since the technology experienced a resurgence is the ability to make you empathise with what you are experiencing. This happened to me the first time I ever did VR, when I watched Clouds Over Sidra, a short VR documentary that put you in the shoes of a Syrian refugee girl, living in a camp in Jordan. I don’t mind admitting that it actually made me cry on my video about the film. It’s this empathy effect that new startup Fountain Digital Labs is is trying to tap into with its Virry VR platform (now nominated for a Webby Award) which allows people to virtually engage with real African animals up close and in their natural habitat. Not all of us can go on a safari, but this just-released immersive virtual reality experience has now launched on PlayStation VR.

Filmed in 4K VR at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, using strategically placed high-definition cameras, Virry VR creates a safari-like experience which also allows the user to control aspects of the narrative.

You can feed lions and even share mud baths with rhinos. Players can also take a trip down an African river and learn about endangered animals.

The initial release of Virry VR for PlayStation includes 35 minutes of experiences with wildlife.

Virry VR users can learn interesting facts, answer questions, and interact with the animals through the virtual experience.

For Virry VR it costs $9.99 and the Live Camera Subscription is $1.50/mo. You can also subscribe for $2.50/mo and thus to donate $1 to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.

For those who don’t have PS4, Virry’s original BAFTA award-winning app for iOS mobile devices is also an option. Subscriptions costs $19.99 a year.

Svetlana Dragayeva, Fountain Digital Lab CEO, says: “Virry immerses players in the lives of real animals, encouraging discovery, empathy, and problem solving, while helping them to better understand nature, conservation, and the world around them.”

The experience has won plaudits from Founding Director of The Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford University, Jeremy Bailenson. He says “I have seen thousands of spherical videos and the footage from Virry VR is the most stunning nature scenes I have ever seen in any medium,” said Bailson. “Seeing a big rhino in its natural home from the perspective of a mud puddle inches away, or having a lion literally lick my face to test if I am edible, were among the coolest things I have done in VR to date. I predict this project will be a huge success in motivating people to learn more about nature and ecosystems.”

Dragayeva is a passionate about the capability of VR to awaken us out of our senses which have been deadened by imagery which is shocking or unusual: “As Sontag observed back in the 70s, ‘At the time of the first photographs of the Nazi camps, there was nothing banal about these images. After 30 years, a saturation point may have been reached. In these last decades, “concerned” photography has done at least as much to deaden conscience as to arouse it’.” So I am in this search for something new. Something that moves, touches, tickles an empathic impulse, creates a bond. VR seems to be well-suited for this at this current moment.”","It may desensitize people to real-life violence and suffering. While VR can be used to create empathy for people in difficult situations, such as refugees, it can also be used to create violent and graphic content that may numbed people to the real-life consequences of violence.",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/why-go-on-safari-when-you-can-feed-an-african-lion-live-via-vr/,2017-04-12 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9946609139442444,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,TechCrunch,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
153,Letter From the Editor: Microsoft's Holographic Goggles Are Strange—But Kind of Awesome,"Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Boy, do I love a shiny new gadget! That feeling, right? The unboxing, the admiration of the curves/chamfers/color/finish/glossy screen, the fumbling for the power button, the futzing and the tinkering, the showing-off to chums. It's a rush. When it comes to the neato new devices that power the WIRED world, my affections know few bounds: rangefinder cameras, sleek smartphones, wireless headphones, robotic vacuums, 4K displays, fitness trackers, smart watches, wafer-thin laptops. I'm a guy who gets hot and bothered about well-designed gear.

If his office is any indication, Satya Nadella knows what I'm talking about. The first time I met the Microsoft CEO, late last fall, I recognized telltale signs: the stack of phones charging near his desk, the rat's nest of cables peeking from behind the corner Xbox/TV setup, the near-constant chime of push notifications (on his iPhone, no less) paired with his fitness tracker—a Microsoft Band. Ding! Ding! Ding! But it wasn't just the gadgets; it was the way he talked about Microsoft's latest piece of hardware, Project HoloLens. “Just wait till you see it,” he said.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has an easygoing approach to management, and that’s changing the software giant’s corporate tone. Platon

An hour later, Alex Kipman (who invented the Kinect for Xbox) helped me don a space-age-looking smoke-tinted visor a bit bigger than a pair of ski goggles. This was Project HoloLens. Kipman told me I was one of the first people who didn't work for Microsoft to wear the device. It was a revelation. As my eyes resolved the images in front of me, I could still see the same room—except that now, in the middle distance between me and Kipman, a circular platform floated like a hologram from Admiral Ackbar's war room. To my left I could now see an array of virtual tools—icons, skeuomorphic buttons, and toggles—that could be used to make stuff. Over the next 30 minutes, I designed and assembled a couple of crude holographic models, each ready to be 3-D-printed, using nothing more than gestures and voice commands. Mind. Blown. I'll leave the details of this technology for Jessi Hempel's cover story —suffice it to say it was a thrilling afternoon of discovery.","It may lead to people becoming more isolated from one another.

154,AR Is Making Its Way into the OR,"More ambitious is a project by Cambridge Consultants that seeks to provide surgeons with the ability to load results from MRI and CT scans into software that renders them into a 3-D visualization of a patient’s organs. The idea: surgeons would be able to perform keyhole procedures with an extra layer of information in front of them, allowing them to take better-informed actions.

The concept is certainly a good one. Such approaches could allow the technology to alert surgeons if they, say, stray too close to a particularly delicate part of anatomy during a procedure. Or else they could help guide less experienced doctors during complex procedures.

But that, of course, raises some interesting questions. Namely, how comfortable would most people feel about surgeries carried out based on data provided via a HoloLens? As Shafi Ahmed, a surgeon at Royal London Hospital, explained to New Scientist: “We can’t trust these systems at the moment.” So the answer is: probably not very, for now at least.

There are clearly some hurdles to overcome. One of the largest will be that of image registration: loading MRI scans into a HoloLens is all well and good, but the body itself moves around naturally, and can look different during surgical procedures—the device will need to adjust the AR image accordingly, which is harder than it sounds. And at any rate, most doctors like to be sure of the technology they’re dealing with, so adoption of the most advanced surgical AR systems will be slow at first.

It is, however, easy enough to imagine the systems being used for less complex augmentation—such as providing relevant numbers or stills of medical scans in the periphery of a surgeon’s vision. So don't be too alarmed if your surgeon asks for the HoloLens as you're about to go under the knife.

(Read more: Engadget, New Scientist, “Microsoft’s New Idea: A Hologram Headset to Rewrite Reality”)",It could potentially lead to patients not being able to trust the surgeons who are using the technology. This is because the technology is still in its early stages and is not yet perfect. There are also concerns that the technology could be used to control people's minds or to manipulate their emotions.,https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/05/11/151744/ar-is-making-its-way-into-the-or/,2017-05-11 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9910878539085388,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,Security & Privacy
155,How An Intelligent Thimble Could Replace the Mouse In 3D Virtual Reality Worlds,"The problem of interacting in three dimensions is by no means new. It’s been possible to buy a computer mouse for some time that senses its position in three dimensions. However these tend to have limited resolution and application.

Anybody who has a modern computer game console such as an Xbox Kinect or a Nintendo Wii, will be aware of the way these devices capture three-dimensional movements and translate them onto 2-D screen. The problem here is that these devices are locked to a particular technology and cannot be transferred to a PC or Mac, for example.

Then there is the LeapMotion, which measures the movement of an entire hand in three-dimensional space. It was launched to great fanfare and anticipation last year but has so far failed to live up to expectations.

Nguyen and Banic have instead aimed to create a cheap device that works as a universal input for more or less any computing device. And they want to make it as small and unobtrusive as possible so that it can be easily transported.

The result is the 3DTouch, a thimble-like device that sits on the end of a finger, equipped with a 3D accelerometer, a 3D magnetometer and 3D gyroscope. That allows the data from each sensor to be compared and combined to produce a far more precise estimate of orientation than a single measurement alone. In addition, the 3DTouch has an optical flow sensor that measures the movement of the device against a two-dimensional surface, exactly like that inside an ordinary mouse.

For the moment, the device is hooked up by wire to an Arduino controller which combines the data from all the sensors. The fused data is then streamed to a conventional laptop. However, Nguyen and Banic recognised the bulkiness of this set up. “This wired connection later could be replaced by a wireless solution using a pair of XBee modules,” they say.

But the ability to know its orientation in space is only one part of this device’s spec. Nguyen and Banic have also built in a number of mouse-like gestures that allow a user to interact with 3-D objects, by selecting and dragging them, for example. These gestures include a finger tap, a double tap and a press gesture. And having more than one 3DTouch on different fingers allows multitouch interaction.

Nguyen and Banic have tested their new device to measure its pointing accuracy and say that it is reasonably good. They say it’s possible to move a three-dimensional object within and 84 x 84 mm target area with a positioning error of only about 1 mm.

And they say they know what modifications could easily improve it, such as a more reliable optical sensor. Given the components used, the 3DTouch should be relatively cheap but Nguyen and Banic do not say just how much it might cost.

Overall, these folks have an interesting device on their hands that could be coming to fruition at precisely the right time. Nguyen and Banic say it will work with existing devices such as a desktop PC or a Cave Autonomous Virtual Environment.

But in recent months, a number of practical virtual reality devices have begun to emerge such as the Oculus Rift and Google cardboard. A cheap and easy way of interacting with these new virtual reality devices could turn out to be hugely useful.

It’s too early to say whether the 3DTouch will fulfil this role but there’s certainly a gap in the market.

156,"Palmer Luckey’s firm has won a contract to make VR, AI, and drones for the Pentagon","One of tech's more controversial figures has a new plan: developing virtual reality and other tech for the US military.

Divisive: Luckey is a VR pioneer who made a fortune by selling his company, Oculus Rift, to Facebook. He has become known for his conservative ideas and comments, and for seeking to develop a “virtual border wall” to help control illegal immigration. Now his new firm, Anduril, has reportedly bagged a contract with the Pentagon on its controversial Project Maven, according to The Intercept.

Virtual patrol: Anduril is developing technology called “Lattice AI” that’s designed to provide soldiers with a view of their surroundings using sensor fusion, virtual reality, and machine learning. “Lattice AI is able to detect, classify and track any car, person, drone or other threat in a restricted area,” the company says on its website. Anduril is also developing a very easy-to-fly drone, called Ghost (shown above), as part of the Lattice system.

Valley backlash: The US government and military are increasingly seeking to collaborate with Silicon Valley in hope of tapping into the latest tech trends and speeding up technology development cycles. But several companies have experienced backlash after inking contracts to help Uncle Sam, especially for work involving artificial intelligence. Most famously, Google was forced to abandon a contract to help the Air Force process drone imagery after worker outcry.

Polarizing filter: Luckey and Anduril both have close ties to the investor and Trump advisor Peter Thiel, his investment firm Founders Found, and his company Palantir, which provides big-data analytics to US defense and intelligence. (Both Anduril and Palantir are named for artifacts described in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings.) Indeed, the story of Anduril shows how polarizing and political it is for the military to collaborate with Silicon Valley—and how some technologists are seizing the opportunity.","Virtual reality has the potential to provide soldiers with a realistic view of their surroundings and the enemy, which could lead to better decision making in combat situations.

157,A Virtual Test for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,"In a pilot study of seven people with PTSD, seven healthy people, and 11 people with trauma but not PTSD, Andrea Webb, who is a psychophysiologist at Draper, and collaborators measured heart rate, finger pulse, respiration, and skin conductance (a measure of stress and excitement), first when the person was calm and then when he or she was shown potentially frightening scenes via virtual-reality goggles. The virtual-reality scenes became progressively more intense. For example, the first might be a helicopter flying overhead; the last might be an insurgent running toward the subject while shooting his weapon.

Previous research by others in the field has shown that people with PTSD tend to have an exaggerated response to these kinds of scenes, with more dramatic increases in heart rate and blood pressure than those recorded in healthy people. Webb’s goal is to take data from the sensors and create algorithms to reliably detect who has PTSD. Although data collection and analysis are still underway, Webb says that preliminary findings show several instances in which people with PTSD did react more strongly than those in the other groups.

Psychologists have used tools like this to study PTSD in a research context for more than 20 years, but bringing the technology into clinical practice has been a challenge. “I have felt for years that there are potential clinical applications in these findings,” says Scott Orr, a psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who was not involved in the Draper research. “But the type of equipment we use requires a fair amount of training and experience and knowledge of psychophysiology.”

Thanks in part to technological advances in physiological sensors, the tools have become simpler, more user-friendly, and more compact, “making them more attractive to clinicians,” says Orr. “The real challenge now is being able to make sense of the information you are collecting.” Webb and collaborators are trying to solve that problem using different approaches to data analysis, including machine learning.

There’s nothing simple about reliably distinguishing people with PTSD from those with other anxiety disorders. For example, both PTSD sufferers and people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a very different disorder, tend to have an exaggerated startle reaction to loud noises. In addition, not everyone with PTSD reacts to frightening situations in the same way. Previous research suggests that some are “non-responders”—they show less change in heart rate and other indicators than people without the disorder. Webb’s team plans to examine these groups as well.

Beyond diagnosis, the technology might also help assess the effectiveness of different treatments for individual patients. “Lots of times, people aren’t good at telling us how they feel,” says Orr. “They may say, I could feel myself getting worked up, and there is nothing in the data,” says Orr. “Or they don’t think they reacted to anything and we see large increases in heart rate or activity.”","It may be used to diagnose and treat patients with PTSD.

158,"VR Meetings Are Weird, but They Beat Our Current Reality","The sun never sets in virtual reality. This occurred to me after an hour-long briefing in an Oculus Quest 2 headset. Joined by more than a dozen other floating avatars, we teleported our way around an “outdoor” meeting space that could only be described as aircraft-carrier-meets-Croatian-vacation.

Beyond the vast expanse of virtual breakout spaces was a stunning sunset, but the day never grew dark. When I pressed a button on the Touch Controller a tad too long, I ended up standing unnervingly close to another avatar, a fellow journalist. Then I remembered that you can’t catch the coronavirus from a digital simulacrum.

The press briefing was one of a few ever to occur in VR, a spokesperson for this new app claimed. It's called Arthur, and part of the pitch is that it’s going to catapult VR for work into the mainstream, that meetings and collaboration sessions and deskside briefings will become … headset briefings.

The app launches today, but it’s been in development for four years. The company behind it, also named Arthur, is headquartered in San Mateo, California, with employees scattered around the globe. It has secured seed funding from VC firm Draper Associates, and it lists the United Nations, Societe General, and a large automaker as its beta testers.

Taking a meeting in Arthur requires a literal suspension of reality. You exist only from the waist up (hey, just like Zoom!), and your shirtsleeves taper off to reveal blue computer arms, which move according to how you move the Oculus Quest controllers in your hands. Your digital eyes are obscured by Matrix-style glasses, and a headset microphone covers your virtual mouth. This is because the technology can’t yet mimic facial expressions in VR, and “it’s better than looking at dead eyes,” says Arthur founder Christoph Fleischmann. My avatar looked nothing like me, except that it had dark brown hair.

Still, meeting in VR felt like somewhere else, if not somewhere in the physical world. I was sitting in the same living room I’ve occupied for most of the year, but I was present with other people. I was aware that my headset’s physical microphone was on, that anything I said would be part of the conversation. It felt rude to step away and start making coffee in my kitchen.

When Fleischmann urged the group to take a seat ahead of a presentation in a virtual amphitheater (which appeared on demand, the fastest and cheapest construction project ever), we scattered awkwardly among the seats the way we might in real life. And after the presentation, during which Fleischmann touted the collaborative benefits of working in VR, we teleported to a roof-deck bar and used our hand controllers to pick up virtual cocktails. Everyone loosened up, despite these being unreal drinks. All the while, the sun remained stuck in its permanent position of almost set. It was surreal, but it beat our current reality.

Meet Me Here

Arthur wouldn’t be the first to try to carve out a space for itself in enterprise VR. Until recently, VR headsets—as well as mixed-reality headsets, like Microsoft’s HoloLens—were prohibitively expensive, costing over $1,000 per unit. Any company looking to make inroads in the industry had to at least consider selling to big businesses, the ones who could afford the nascent technology. That was the approach Spatial took, a buzzy New York-based startup that WIRED’s Julian Chokkattu covered earlier this year.

“We always say we’re like Zoom and Slack had an AR/VR baby,” Jacob Loewenstein, Spatial’s head of business, tells me over Zoom from his New York City apartment (the Zoom meeting was my request; I was on deadline and didn’t want to dither in VR). “And we really mean it. Because if we succeed it’s because we’ve made this thing just stupidly easy to use.”","Although VR has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and communicate, there is a risk that it will further isolate us from the physical world and from each other.

159,China watches and learns from the US in AR/VR competition,"When Chi Xu left Magic Leap and returned to China, he had big ambitions. He believed China would have its own augmented and virtual reality giants, just as how the domestic smartphone industry birthed global leaders like Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi that rival Apple today.

Xu, now chief executive of Nreal, one of China’s highest-funded AR startups, is among a group of entrepreneurs uniquely positioned to build world-class hardware. The young generation is well-versed in both worlds, with work experience in Silicon Valley and often an Ivy League degree. They are also well-connected to capital and supply chains in China, which would support them through cycles of iteration to deliver powerful yet affordable products.

Although China has been calling for more indigenous innovation, most of the advanced technologies found in AR and VR are still in the hands of foreign tech behemoths.

They might be proud of China’s technological progress, but they recognize supremacy doesn’t come overnight. More importantly, their firms often have intricate ties to the U.S., whether it’s for sourcing core parts or testing an early market.

Despite Beijing’s push for technological “self-reliance,” Chinese AR and VR companies still depend on imported chips like their smartphone counterparts. Because the industry is so young and no one really has a proven model for monetization, few investors and startups in China are willing to splurge on basic research.

But China has one important strength, said the founder of a Chinese AR startup who declined to be named: “In cutting-edge sectors, China has always lacked the talent to take things from ‘zero to one.’ However, China has the mass production and supply chain capabilities necessary for taking things from ‘one to n.'”

That was the case with smartphones. Once Apple demonstrated the technological and financial possibilities of handsets and gave rise to a production ecosystem around iPhones — in other words, catapulted the industry from zero to one — Chinese counterparts took cues from the American giant, made use of homegrown manufacturing resources and began delivering cheaper and even more powerful alternatives.

“I can’t imagine any Chinese corporations willing to invest in AR and VR as heavily as Microsoft, Apple or Facebook today,” said the founder, whose company sells headsets both in and outside China.

“On the contrary, China is good at playing catch-up by spending money on a race with a clear finish line. For example, chips. If there are already contestants in the area, so long as [Chinese firms] ramp up investment and follow the direction, they can deliver results.”

Chinese innovation

Although China, for the last decade, has been calling for more indigenous innovation, most of the advanced technologies found in AR and VR are still in the hands of foreign tech behemoths, several industry experts told TechCrunch. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips are used almost exclusively by serious players, from Facebook’s Oculus Quest in the U.S. to Pico and Nreal in China. Advanced optical solutions, on the other hand, mainly come from Japanese and Taiwanese firms.

That’s not to say Chinese companies don’t innovate. Prominent venture capitalist and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee famously argued in his book “AI Superpowers” that while the U.S. has an edge in fundamental research, China is stronger on implementation and commercial application.

“It’s true that the more experimental efforts are happening in the U.S., though I’m not sure if any of those are mature already,” Tony Zhao, founder and chief executive of real-time video API provider Agora and a veteran from WebEx, told TechCrunch. “For Chinese companies, there are more opportunities in [user experience].”

As AR and VR come of age, Zhao’s company is devising a toolkit to let developers and organizations stream and record AR content from devices. Use cases by China’s educators have particularly impressed Zhao. One client, for example, built a tool allowing a teacher to interact with a student through a virtual store, where the two speak English while they respectively act as the cashier and the customer.

“I think it’s very revolutionary because a lot of kids are going to be very excited to learn from those kinds of tools. It’s more like a real experience and would be more natural for students to learn to use a language instead of just know the grammar,” said Zhao.

“These solutions are already creative, but also very practical.”

The Chinese market offers other aspects that can keep investors excited. As Gavin Newton-Tanzer, president of Sunrise International, Asia producer of the “mixed reality” (XR) conference AWE, pointed out to TechCrunch:

“Many like to say that in the U.S., Magic Leap sucked all the air out of the room. They raised tons of money and as a result, few wanted to fund [other smart glass startups]. It’d be like funding a competitor to Didi in China or funding a competitor to Uber in the U.S. … Few felt like anyone else could meaningfully compete.”","It may isolate people from real social interaction.

Today, Meta is customizing this feature by allowing users to optionally turn the setting off, or control when it’s enabled.

Instead of making the boundary default to on for all Horizon Worlds experiences, Meta said today it will allow users to choose whether or not they want the setting enabled for all interactions. Now, VR users will be able to turn their Personal Boundary off, as was the standard prior to the feature’s launch. There is still a small personal boundary to prevent unwanted interactions, the company says — but this was not enough in the past to prevent bad actors from simulating rape in Meta’s virtual worlds, we should note.

Users will also be able to turn the Personal Boundary on for non-Friends only, which would enable the extra safety feature when you’re with people you don’t know, but leave it off when you’re virtually hanging out with people on your friends list. You also can choose to keep the Personal Boundary enabled for all experiences, as before.

However, Meta says it’s adjusting the default setting to keep the Personal Boundary on for non-Friends only, which means it’s dialing back the safety feature a bit. Given that Horizon Worlds is a new social network, people may be friending other users they don’t know in real life after meeting them in the virtual space. That means a user’s friends list may not be quite the same as a list of people the user explicitly trusts. So some caution should still be advised here.

Meta claims the changes were made based on community feedback after February’s rollout of the Personal Boundary feature. The company believes the new options will make it easier for people to high-five, fist-bump and take selfies with other avatars in Horizon Worlds.

In addition, Meta says the Personal Boundary will default to the more restrictive setting when two people meet for the first time. For example, if one person’s Personal Boundary is off but the other person’s is set to On for Everyone, then the platform will establish a four-foot space between both people. And it says the Personal Boundary will now default to on at roughly four feet for everyone participating in its live events VR experience Horizon Venues.

In its announcement about the changes, Meta acknowledged that developing for VR represents “what are perhaps some of the hardest challenges we’ve tackled in a generation of computing now that we’re no longer limited by fixed viewpoints and traditional flatscreen devices.”

But this statement seems to throw the blame for its earlier failures to protect women in its VR space solely on the fact that building for VR worlds is something new and, therefore, some trial and error will be involved. But had Meta sought the input of more women engineers or gamers to begin with, it’s hard to imagine this topic wouldn’t have come up. After all, sexual assault in virtual spaces is something that’s happened before, repeatedly — including in other virtual reality games, in VR precursors like Second Life, and even in a children’s virtual game on Roblox. It’s unbelievable that the company would not have considered built-in protections when designing a new VR environment. It also shows Facebook’s tendency to design for growth and scale first and user safety second is also carrying over to its new projects, like Horizon Worlds.

The company says it will continue to iterate and make improvements as it learns more about how Personal Boundary impacts the VR experience.","The potential for sexual assault and harassment in virtual spaces. This is something that has happened before in other virtual reality games and platforms, and is something that Meta is now trying to address with its new Personal Boundary feature. However, some people believe that this feature is not enough to prevent bad actors from simulating rape in Meta's virtual worlds, and that more needs to be done to protect users from this type of behavior.",https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/meta-to-allow-horizon-worlds-users-to-turn-their-avatars-personal-safety-boundary-off-despite-virtual-world-sexual-assaults/,2022-03-14 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9956323504447936,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,TechCrunch,Social Norms & Relationships
161,Holograms Could Bring Videogame-Like Navigation to Your Car,"There are plenty of ways to get directions in the car, but most have one big shortcoming. Whether you're using a standalone GPS, in-car navi system, smartphone, the Apple Watch, or even a paper map, you have to look away from the road (you know, that thing you're supposed to be paying attention to when driving) in order to see where you're supposed to be going.

So how to keep your eyes on the road and not get lost? One option is the heads-up display. Increasingly common on high-end cars, these devices project things like navigation directions and current speed onto the windshield, so the driver has important information right in their field of vision. It's a technology that's fast spreading beyond this incarnation, though: We've seen screens showing ghost cars for racers, and another that uses lasers to ""paint"" the edge of a road on the windshield in inclement weather. Then there are these wacky augmented reality concept goggles from Mini.

One of the latest gadgets to enter the fray is something called the Navion, from Swiss firm WayRay.

The videogame version of a heads-up display, from the Xbox One's Forza Horizon 2. Forza Horizon 2

The Navion, which is still a prototype for the time being, promises to project holographic imagery onto the windshield from a small device sitting on the dashboard, so you don't have to buy a new car equipped with the tech to reap the benefits. It throws navigation information and safety notifications right where you can see them. The navi directions look just like the arrows projected on the road in videogames like Forza Horizon 2.

It all sounds swell, except for the part where the company says the device responds to hand gestures for control. While some automakers have talked about this kind of feature, there's little evidence it's ready for the market, and a recent J.D. Power study showed consumers have close to no interest in waving their hands to control their vehicles. I need to use the Team America secret signal to get driving directions? No thanks.

Minus that bit, if the Navion works (and ever hits the market), it could be fantastically useful. WayRay asks interested customers to sign up for its mailing list ahead of pre-orders opening later this year.","One potential downside of virtual reality, as mentioned in the article, is that it could take drivers' attention away from the road. While this technology has the potential to provide important information to drivers without them having to take their eyes off the road, it's possible that it could also be a distraction. If drivers are too focused on the virtual world, they could miss important cues from the real world, which could lead to accidents.",https://www.wired.com/2015/04/holograms-bring-videogame-like-navigation-car/,2015-04-28 20:09:12+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9774689078330994,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
162,Virtual CES Was As Surreal As We All Suspected It Would Be,"As soon as I logged into CES’s online portal, I knew this year’s techfest was going to be ... different.

The first few hours of virtual press conferences this past Monday reached literary levels of meta: sheets of TV screens, viewed through our screens, while we typed out dispatches for people to read on their screens. Later that same morning I tried to toggle between two virtual events instead of being physically present in just one. TV-maker TCL showed off a rollable phone concept, and I wondered if I had clicked on the wrong tab and entered the Samsung universe by mistake.

At first it was just this; the mild inconveniences of attending a multi-day virtual event, the musings on what we’ve learned about online conferences during the coronavirus pandemic. Normally, more than 150,000 people would gather in Las Vegas every January to gawk at the gadgets and mingle with marketers. In July 2020, the Consumer Technology Association (which runs CES) pulled the plug on any kind of in-person event for January 2021 and started planning an online event instead. This year’s CES would be a bridge year, a best effort to make things seem “normal” while we all wonder if we’ll return to a real normal by January 2022. (I’d really, really like to be together again next year.)

But as this week wore on, as I watched online keynote sessions and marketing videos promising sharp visions of the future, the value of an all-virtual CES actually became less clear. The new products, which we usually look forward to, felt less exciting. It’s hard to determine the viability of any product by watching a slick video about it. The series of keynotes and panels about the future of tech felt less like revelatory conversations and more like TED Talk offshoots I might scroll past in my Twitter feed. And while most of the press conferences, keynote sessions, and panels referenced the global pandemic—how could you not—the rest of the event played out as though a deadly attack on the US Capitol hadn’t just happened last week.

“Walking” the virtual show floor at Pepcom—a product demo event for the media that occurs alongside CES—involved clicking on a digital quilt of company logos one by one, a far cry from the usual booth-browsing and buffet-grazing that happens at the in-person event. Hardware makers showed off everything from earbud-equipped N95 masks to UV sanitizing tech. Here’s what we came for, right? The gadgets? A game company has released a protective face mask with “Razer Chroma” RGB lighting zones on each ventilator, so there’s that. Maybe this will convince people to wear one?

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

It’s this kind of practiced optimism that keeps us coming back to CES year after year. Some people really appreciate CES for the escapism it offers. And for journalists, there were some benefits to the all-virtual event. We could browse the online product catalogs on our own schedules. Product demonstration videos, both preproduced and live-streamed, were right at our fingertips. The CTA plans to leave the entire website up for the next month, so people can continue to watch the sessions and panels. Maybe we even got a little more sleep this year, since we spent less time criss-crossing Las Vegas in cabs and shuttles, editing on-the-scene video spots, or kibitzing in hotel bars.

But the heart and soul of CES isn’t the smooth-talking prognosticators or the journalists who follow them. It’s the tech makers who make the show special, and an all-virtual CES wasn’t necessarily good for them. “The smaller brands were probably the ones who suffered the most this year,” says Carolina Milanesi, an analyst and founder of The Heart of Tech research firm. “Because unless you were given a designated place or experience on the website, it was just a long list of names.”

Milanesi shared an observation that one of my WIRED colleagues made as well: The serendipity of discovery was gone. One of the most exciting parts of CES has been finding a weird product in some back corner of the giant expo hall and learning about something new through pure chance. At a virtual CES, that’s a virtual impossibility.","It is difficult to impossible to serendipitously discover new products and technologies at a virtual CES. In other words, the best way to find new and innovative products at CES is to physically walk the expo hall and stumble upon them, but this is not possible with a virtual CES. This lack of serendipitous discovery could lead to less innovation overall, as people are less likely to be exposed to new ideas and technologies.",https://www.wired.com/story/virtual-ces-2021-was-strange/,2021-01-15 19:56:11.154000+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9918442368507384,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
163,Want to Know the Real Future of AR/VR? Ask Their Devs,"If you want to get a rosy view of the future of virtual and augmented reality, ask a company that works in the space. If you want to get a pessimistic view, ask an investor. But if you want a realistic view, one shaped by experience instead of conjecture and wishful thinking, ask the folks who are actually making the stuff. From their perspective, according to a new report from the organizers of the annual conference XRDC, things aren't looking bad at all.

Reports like these aren't uncommon, but they're usually published by analyst firms who conduct research by talking to companies. Instead, XRDC's ""AR/VR Innovation Report"" was generated from an online survey of more than 900 developers. ""Our main goal is to get a sense of the temperature of the industry, which spans from hobbyists and students to professionals working on big-budget projects,"" says Alex Wawro, an editor at XRDC and Gamasutra who has been involved with the annual survey since it began in 2016.

While the pool of respondents is larger this year than ever before, the status quo remains unchanged in some ways. Games are still the primary driver of the industry, with 59 percent of developers' current or potential VR and AR projects falling in the gaming space. However, the survey saw pronounced growth in a number of other fields, particularly education (33 percent) and training (27 percent). That growth dovetails with another interesting shift: when developers expect to turn a profit. In past years, Wawro says, most have expected their VR/AR work to be profitable in the medium term, but this year saw a two-fold jump in people who said their projects aren't tied to profitability at all.

Peter Rubin writes about media, culture, and virtual reality for WIRED.

Why that is, exactly, is a matter of speculation, but given the influx of talks proposed for this year's XRDC around health care and workplace training, Wawro suggests that it might be a function of the purpose of such projects. Government agencies, nonprofits, and businesses creating internally focused experiences aren't making VR and AR for consumers at all, which skews their priorities away from profit. (XRDC is in fact a new designation; it was known as VRDC for its first five years, but with the rise of platforms like Magic Leap it's more actively encompassing augmented/mixed reality.)

The survey also points to a shakeup of sorts on the hardware front. As has been the case since the survey's inception, HTC and Oculus dominate the results to the question ""On which AR/VR/MR platform are you developing your current project?"" The HTC Vive has been the favorite in each of the survey's previous three years, but this year the Oculus Rift leapt ahead—and the brand-new standalone headset Oculus Quest tied the Vive. Wawro calls the shift ""small but significant,"" and readily admits that while the Quest's all-in-one form factor made it an obvious choice to rank high among developers, he's less sure why the Rift would have overtaken the Vive. Regardless, it looks set to continue: Rift and Quest remain the top two choices for developers' next projects. (PlayStation's PSVR takes up a distant rear among the major VR headsets, with a mere 7 percent of developers using it for their current project and only 11 percent using it for their next project—less than even AR wearables like Microsoft HoloLens and the Magic Leap One.)

LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Virtual Reality

Asked what he'd expect to see in next year's survey, Wawro points not to hardware but to content. ""In the past,"" he says, ""stuff like Pokémon Go or Beat Saber or The VOID's installations really get our developers excited and talking about what they'd do with this. This field is really ripe for software to come shake things up."" There’s still room, of course, for a major company to swing in and upset the landscape—a condition that seems increasingly likely. As reported by Road to VR, Apple has gone on a hiring spree for positions with ""AR/VR"" in the title, suggesting that its long-rumored wearable AR device, despite recent conjecture, is very much alive.

And if it is, it would be entering a marketplace that Wawro says has matured past its initial stumbles, but is finding new ones. ""In the beginning, everything we heard in surveys and at events was that developers were concerned about making people nauseous,"" he says. ""This year we didn't see nearly as many concerns in that vein. At the same time, we saw developers complain that the industry is difficult to navigate—that's not too different from any young industry, but I hope as we go forward we'll see a concerted effort from companies to standardize the tools we use to make these experiences.""

164,AR startup Meta sues former head of optics over alleged trade secrets theft,"A top augmented reality startup is suing its former head of optics for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets in the creation of his own AR company.

Meta, which builds augmented reality hardware and software, filed suit earlier this week in a Northern California court against former employee Zhangyi Zhong, his company DreamWorld and 20 unnamed defendants.

The lawsuit alleges that Zhong “shamelessly leveraged” his time at the company to “misappropriate confidential and trade secret information relating to Meta’s technologies, supply chain, manufacturing methods and relationships, as well as business, investment and market strategies,” in the creation of his augmented reality startup, DreamWorld.

Zhong joined Meta in March of 2015 as a Senior Optical Engineer before his resignation in July of 2016.

Meta has raised more than $73 million in funding for its AR systems from top investors, including Y Combinator, Tencent, Comcast Ventures and Lenovo.

The San Mateo-based company has built a tethered augmented reality device, the “Meta 2,” which boasts a much wider field-of-view (FoV) than competitors, though its optics rely on far-less complex (and less expensive) technologies than the displays used by products like Microsoft’s HoloLens.

While Meta 2 has an FoV measured at around 90-degrees, Zhong claims that his company’s DreamGlass device will have an FoV of 100-degrees. Dreamworld plans to launch pre-orders for the device soon at a price of $350. The Meta 2 development kit currently costs $949.

Meta is claiming that Zhong’s has gone beyond stealing trade secrets and is also using Meta’s “market penetration strategy.”

While competitors like Microsoft are using the early generations of their hardware to prove out its SLAM mapping technologies while implementing expensive technologies that it hopes to miniaturize and improve, Meta seems to have focused a great deal of its effort on utilizing accessible hardware technologies to bring more robust visual user experiences to developers initially and secure interest while continuing to build out and miniaturize its technologies.

In the suit, Meta detailed that it has been creating versions of its optical engine that have wider field-of-views in smaller form factors than its current offering while it has also been exploring the idea of powering future headsets off of mobile devices rather than PCs.

Thought the lawsuit details that “Meta believes in free and fair competition in the augmented reality marketplace,” the suit alleges that Zhong had no experience with some of the technologies central to the DreamGlass device before joining Meta. Zhong is listed as an inventor on a patent related to Meta’s “Wide field of view head-mounted display apparatuses, methods and systems.”

Oddly, the suit also alleges that Zhong attempted to obscure his identity by changing his nickname from “Johnny” to “Kevin” after leaving the company, while not updating his LinkedIn profile to reflect his new position as CEO of DreamWorld.

Meta did not provide further comment on the lawsuit.

165,Google Glass' Lead Electrical Engineer Adrian Wong Defects To Oculus,"Adrian Wong still lists himself as a “professional daydreamer” on LinkedIn, but he’s just left Google[x] where he was a lead electrical engineer on Glass to start “Building the Metaverse” at Oculus VR. Wong had been at Google since December 2010 following a stint at Sandia National Laboratories, but now he’s working at Facebook’s latest mega-acquisition.

A source clued us in to Wong’s move, and while he still lists his employer as “Google X” on Google+, his LinkedIn confirms the shift. I got in touch with Wong but he politely declined to comment. On May 2nd, Wong posted his goodbye note to his fellow Googlers…on Facebook, which should have been a clue. He wrote “#FreshStartFridays – Surprise! Today is my last day at Google. Three rollercoaster years with Google[x] and Glass. What amazing memories. Now, time for the next great adventure!” That adventure is apparently building the hardware to power virtual reality.

Wong’s LinkedIn lists him as the former hardware engineering manager on systems, camera, and RF for the consumer edition of Glass, and the Senior Hardware Engineer on the Explorer edition, where he handled end-to-end rapid prototyping, display subsystem design and HDI PCB layout. On AngelList he characterized his time at Sandia as being a “former spy gadget maker for US gov’t”.

Wong holds at least 10 patents, many that relate to Glass-style smart eyewear, including “Wearable Computer with Nearby Object Response”, “Wearable Computer with Superimposed Controls and Instructions for External Device”, “Method to Autofocus on Near-Eye Display”, and “Unlocking a screen using eye tracking information. He also has Bachelors and Masters Degrees in computer and electrical engineering from Cornell. Considering Wong’s expertise, accomplishments, and position, he’s a big loss for Google.

Wong’s skills could help Oculus make its Rift VR headset more capable of rendering virtual worlds without making people sick. He could also help shrink the headset into a more graceful consumer product.

The ability to poach high-profile employees like Wong is surely one benefit of Oculus shifting from Kickstarted startup to being backed by one of the biggest companies in the world. Why Facebook has pledged to let Oculus operate independently, it’s known to help its acquisitions behind the scenes with things like recruiting. Google is known for its generous counter-offers, so Oculus may have needed Facebook’s piggy bank behind it to make the steal.

While there was plenty of developer rabble-rousing when Facebook bought by Oculus, its CEO Brendan Iribe told me last week that the acquisition actually convinced some big dev houses to start building for Oculus because its longevity was assured. The potential to not just make an indie gaming device but to potentially turn the Rift’s virtual reality into the next big computing platform may have lured Wong to Oculus as well.

166,My Highly Unexpected Heterosexual Pandemic Zoom Wedding,"We were in the middle of promising to grow old together when the sound cut out. The officiant’s face pixelated and froze, and we couldn’t hear what she was mouthing. Until the Wi-Fi started working we wouldn’t know whether or not we were married.

It was 8 am. We were standing alone on the tiny front porch of an Airbnb in a country where we are both foreigners, with some string lights hastily flung over the metal grating. My mum, his mum, and two witnesses were just visible on screen, shouting soundlessly, all of us wondering if this was the internet raising a last-minute objection. It was cold. I cuddled into my giant rainbow stripey jumper, the comfort garment that got me through nine months of quarantine. I was glad I’d thrown it on in lieu of a wedding dress. He reached for my hand.

Nothing was going to plan—but then, nothing has gone to plan all year, and certainly not since I met the madman in the bowtie standing in front of me. My sister, who has spent lockdown in London organizing professional events and knows what to do when these things happen, texted me to translate what the officiant was mouthing. You’ve got to log back in to the platform. After some tense minutes of telling our guests on Zoom to hang on, sorry, everyone, talk amongst yourselves while we get this sorted—we finally got the sound back, sort of, although the officiant now sounded like an excited fax machine.

The line buzzed. Time seemed to go very, very slowly.

“As I was saying,” she intoned, “by the power vested in me by the state of Utah, I now pronounce you husband and wife.”

All right, let me explain.

In love as in war, technology allows people to do what they would have done anyway, faster and with fewer immediate consequences. Before there was Match.com there were matchmakers and Miss Lonelyhearts; before there was Grindr there were gloryholes; the polyamorous millennials sharing their Google calendars with a constellation of partners are the inheritors of every fastidious hippie who ever took five hours to explain free love with flowcharts.

But there is no exact pre-digital equivalent of the 4 am status update. It combines the desperate passion of toilet graffiti with the intimacy of a barstool confessional.

It was June, and the world was on fire, and I was drunk. I had spent the first part of lockdown engaging in demeaning Zoom dating as an alternative to more debilitating methods of self-harm. This culminated with a chap I’d been going on virtual dates with for a month announcing that he had, in fact, been interviewing several candidates for the position of girlfriend and, regrettably, I had not made the cut. A few days later, lightly chemically altered, I made a post letting everyone on Facebook know that I was bored of being single, out of practice at flirting, and if anyone had any attractive single friends they should let me know.

In the morning, fumbling to delete the post, I saw that I was already too late. People had started to chime in, including a shy anthropologist from Australia with nice hair who I had met a total of once, three years ago. He was far too far away himself, he said, but he might know somebody in my city. I pointed out that in quarantine times, everyone not living next door might as well be on the moon.

167,Virtual-Reality Paperboy Actually Makes You Pedal and Heave Papers,"



1 / 4 Chevron Chevron PBOY4 PaperDude VR is an homage to Paperboy, using Kinect, Oculus Rift, and a bike sensor. Image: Globacore

If you need proof of the power of videogames, look no further than Paperboy. What other medium could transform quintessential summer-job drudgery into a diversion kids couldn't wait to get their hands on? Granted, you didn't have to wake up at 4 a.m. to service the virtual customers on your Game Boy, and you didn't have to haul your ass around the neighborhood to do it, either. But that was then. Now, thanks to sophisticated motion-sensing technologies and cutting-edge virtual reality hardware, we have PaperDude VR, an updated version of the classic game that's very nearly as exhausting as the job that inspired it all in the first place.

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

PaperDude VR, an unofficial homage to the Atari original, was created by Globacore, an interactive outfit in Toronto specializing in custom, branded videogames. The gameplay is old-school Paperboy: You chuck papers at subscribers' houses, racking up points for hitting mailboxes and bleeding them when you accidentally hurl one through a window. The experience of playing the game, however, is radically different. Instead of sprawling backwards on your couch and squinting down into your Game Boy's tiny pea-soup screen, here, thanks to an Oculus Rift headset, you find yourself transported into a vivid, panoramic (but still charmingly blocky) world. Rather than mashing buttons, you actually have to act like you're throwing papers, with every movement tracked by a Kinect camera. And because your in-game locomotion is connected to a real, stationary bike outfitted with a KickR speed tracker, you'll have to do some pedaling, too.

Still, from the video clip above, the virtual paper route looks like highly enjoyable work. Ben Unsworth, Globacore's founder, concurs: ""It's amazingly satisfying when you get one of the papers in a mailbox,"" he says. ""It's also entertaining throwing one through a window and hearing the smashing sound."" Right now the game's a rough prototype, but his team hopes to add more elements from the original down the road, like the rogue lawnmowers and breakdancers, and the the exceedingly frustrating dirt bike interlude at the end of each stage. Of course, there's a rich irony here. It's 2013, and regional print newspapers are wilting like flowers. Yet here we are, resurrecting them as digital objects with bleeding-age gaming technology. In a sense, PaperDude VR isn't just tapping into our nostalgia for Paperboy, but for the golden age of paper routes in general. Heavy.

>""It's amazingly satisfying when you get one of the papers in a mailbox.""

On a technical level, though, the project is fascinating simply for giving us a slightly different take on what the incipient wave of low-cost virtual reality could bring. Instead of showing us other hyper-realistic worlds, vistas that strive to be as detailed as the ones we see with our own eyes, gear like the Oculus Rift could also whisk us back to the places we spent so much of our youths: the worlds of our favorite videogames. Maybe Mario Kart doesn't thrill you like it once did, but what if it put you down there behind the wheel, in first-person, looking over your shoulder at a fast-approaching green shell? Or if you had to navigate the dim corridors of Pac-Man's iconic maze through the eyes of Pac-Man himself? That might actually be pretty terrifying. But the point is that virtual reality could yield an entirely new breed of spin-offs and sequels, ones that took familiar games into all-new territory.

But in the case of PaperDude VR, the pleasure isn't just about revisiting a fondly remembered videogame. Even in the game's pixelated suburbia, Unsworth says, there's fun to be had just riding around. ""Since I'm not a daily biker, I'm often surprised whenever I'm outdoors on a real bike about how pleasurable that simple experience of movement is. Amazingly in this game you get that,"" he explains. ""Sitting up at the end of the game and freewheel coasting through the Game Over finish line, hands off the handlebars, snaps me back to my youth–the part not spent in front of the computer.""","The potential for addiction. While the game PaperDude VR is not addictive in and of itself, it does show how virtual reality can be used to create an immersive experience that can be very appealing to people. If people are not careful, they could find themselves spending too much time in virtual reality and neglecting their real-life responsibilities.

“I would press it in a microsecond,” says Sebastian Thrun, who previously led Stanford University’s AI Lab.

Turning yourself into a cyborg might sound like pure sci-fi, but recent progress in AI, neural implants, and wearable gadgets make it seem increasingly imaginable.

The weird and wonderful worlds of transhumanism and human enhancement are the subject of the 10th installment of the Sleepwalkers podcast. The final episode in the first season examines a subject that seems to resonate with techno-optimists in Silicon Valley but also raises some big questions: Where do we draw the line between humans and machines? Who should benefit from such technology? How do we retain control of our humanity?

Thrun, a prominent artificial intelligence expert who cofounded Google’s self-driving car project and helped develop the ill-fated wearable computer, Google Glass, argues that human beings are already a product of centuries of technological progress, so it would be foolish to forgo further enhancements. “The human I/O—the input/output, the ears and eyes and smell and so on, voice—are still very inefficient,” he says. “If I could accelerate the reading of all the books into my brain, oh my God, that would be so awesome.”

Yuval Noah Harari, a historian who speculates about humanity’s future, is a leading figure in the burgeoning transhumanist movement. In his recent book, Homo Deus, Harari suggests that our ability to enhance ourselves with computers and bioengineering has already opened up a new era in human history. But he also fears this era—perhaps accelerated by AI—could pose an existential threat to our species. “We are really deciphering the underlying rules of the game of life, and are acquiring the ability to change these rules,” Harari warns.

For now though, using technology to alter our intelligence remains a distant dream, says Andy Schwartz, a neurobiologist at the University of Pittsburgh who works on brain-controlled computer interfaces for patients with physical disabilities. Although the technology is advancing, Schwartz says, it is a mistake to think it will become a pervasive consumer technology within the foreseeable future. “That's actually not true of a medically invasive procedure that involves putting implants on the surface of the brain,” he cautions.

As technology marches forward, there are many who stand to benefit from human enhancements. Noé Socha, an award-winning jazz guitarist with limited vision, is testing glasses that use video cameras and high-definition screens in front of the retina to restore some eyesight. Socha’s experience highlights the fact that simple enhancements could benefit those with disabilities most, potentially transforming their worlds.","One of the key unintended consequences of virtual reality, as discussed in the above article, is the potential for it to exacerbate pre-existing mental health conditions. For example, if someone with a history of anxiety or depression spends too much time in a virtual world, it could worsen their symptoms. Additionally, virtual reality could also lead to addiction and social isolation, as people become more invested in their online lives and less interested in real-world interactions.",https://www.wired.com/story/enhanced-intelligence-vr-sex-our-cyborg-future/,2019-12-30 13:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9952659606933594,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Health & Wellbeing
169,Can VR Really Make You More Empathetic?,"The year is 1994, and the bleeding edge of virtual reality is Dactyl Nightmare: an arcade game where you run from swooping pterodactyls. Jeremy Bailenson, a college student then, got his first taste of VR playing it at an arcade in San Francisco. “The technology was of course horrific back then,” he says.

But virtual reality isn’t just about video games anymore. Artists, activists, and journalists now see the technology’s potential to be an empathy engine, one that can shine spotlights on everything from the Ebola epidemic to what it’s like to live in Gaza. And Bailenson has been at the vanguard of investigating VR’s power for good.

For more than a decade, his lab at Stanford has been studying how VR can make us better people. Through the power of VR, volunteers at the lab have felt what it is like to be Superman (to see if it makes them more helpful), a cow (to reduce meat consumption), and even a coral (to learn about ocean acidification).

Silly as they might seem, these sorts of VR scenarios could be more effective than the traditional public service ad at making people behave. Afterwards, they waste less paper. They save more money for retirement. They’re nicer to the people around them. And this could have consequences in terms of how we teach and train everyone from cliquey teenagers to high court judges.

Virtual Human Interaction Lab

Wrinkles and chainsaws

Until recently, studying VR was considered too far-out for academia. But that was never a problem for Bailenson. The professor has a surfer’s mane of blonde hair, but he talks too fast to be a native Californian. (He grew up in upstate New York and spent a decade in the Midwest for school before making it out West.) He clearly relishes his position on the cutting-edge, and is fond of the phrase “for the first time in human history.”

Case in point: avatars. Bailenson says that avatars, people’s representations in the virtual world, now allow humans to watch themselves doing something they’ve never done---“for the first time in human history.” In one study from Bailenson’s lab, undergraduate students looked into a virtual mirror and saw their own faces, aged to 70, staring back. After the VR experience, they took a questionnaire about allocating $1,000 from an unexpected windfall.","It can make people more selfish.

170,The Golden State Warriors used virtual reality to woo Kevin Durant,"The Golden State Warriors laid it on pretty thick for Kevin Durant during the team’s successful free-agent pitch to the NBA superstar last week. In addition to having two-time MVP Stephen Curry and fellow Warriors’ all-stars, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, attend the meeting, the team also tapped into its Silicon Valley backyard to hit KD with a virtual reality presentation.

According to USA Today Sports, the Warriors gave Durant a VR headset to show him the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, a courtside view at Oracle Arena and a look at coach Steve Kerr talking to his players in the locker room, so he could envision himself being there. The VR footage was accompanied by Drake and Future’s “Big Rings,” the Warriors theme song, which, incidentally, include the lyrics, “Oh you switchin’ sides? Wanna come with me?”

The high-tech effort paid off, as KD, of course, left the Oklahoma City Thunder team that he had played with for all nine years of his NBA career to sign with the Warriors on a two-year, $54.3 million deal earlier this week. Chalk this up to when virtual reality becomes reality.","It may cause people to become more isolated from each other.

171,Google Wants to Turn You Into a Hologram. I Tested It Out,"Video: Google

Over the past several years, Google has been working hard to craft software experiences that make you feel like you’re present with another human being, even if they’re several time zones away. On one end of the spectrum is boring Google Meet, the company’s Zoom competitor. On the other, more daring end is the now discontinued virtual-reality platform Daydream, complete with goggles and hand controllers.

But nothing within that gamut was cutting it for Clay Bavor, the high-energy Googler who heads up the company’s augmented- and virtual-reality efforts. He wanted full-on photo-realistic, volumetric video meetings that make it look, sound, and feel like the other person is sitting across the table from you—no headset required.

So his team built a video booth. The new prototype machine for face-to-face meetings is named Project Starline. Call it hyper-telepresence. Call it whatever you want. Either way, it’s pretty wild.

The phrase “video booth” really is the simplest way to describe Starline in its current form: It's a large booth, like the kind you’d find in a diner, just way more technologically complex. I had the chance to test-drive it in early May. After an initial conversation with Bavor outside of Google’s campus in Mountain View, California, I was led inside the almost empty building and escorted to a private office. There was the Starline booth, part wood-paneled and partly encased in gray fabric, with a built-in bench on one side and a 65-inch display on the other. I was instructed to sit opposite the display. There were lights, cameras, and not a whole lot of action until a product manager sat down across from me. From a very specific angle, he looked as though he was sitting across from me. But he was on a different floor of the building, piping into our meeting through Starline.

This is Google’s idea for the future of videoconferencing, a giddy vision that only a small group of Googlers have had access to, and one that has apparently gotten a thumbs-up from chief executive Sundar Pichai. You couldn’t be blamed for thinking that Starline must have been developed during the pandemic, while desk workers were umm-ing and muting and unmuting their way through an endless stream of Meets and Zooms. But Bavor says there wasn’t really any aha moment that led to Project Starline. In fact, it’s been in the works for over five years.

“What has always excited me about virtual and augmented reality is this idea that these technologies can take you other places, and they can make you feel present somewhere else,” Bavor says. “But it didn’t seem like there was a way of bringing the most important things in the world to you, namely, the people you care about.”

The company gave the public a virtual glimpse of Project Starline today during its annual IO conference. But Starline is still just a concept, unlikely to liven up your Google Meet meetings for several years.","It could lead to people becoming more isolated from one another.

172,Clever Hack Gives The Oculus Rift The Button It's Missing,"The first time people try on the Oculus Rift, they tend to have two immediate reactions. First: “Whoa.” Second: “Wait, where’s my keyboard? Hold on. Are my fingers on the keys? Just a second. Okay, got it. Wait, lost it. Okay, here we go.”

As much as I dig the Oculus Rift (and, if you’ve been reading my stuff for a while, you’d know: that’s a lot), I’ll admit that it has one rather annoying fault: the input devices we traditionally use to interact with computers aren’t quite up to snuff, here.

Keyboard and mouse? Once you put on the Rift, you can’t see a thing in the real world around you. Finding your mouse and keyboard (much less the good ol’ home row) becomes a pain.

Gestures (by pairing the Rift with something like the Kinect)? A reasonable option, but it lacks any sort of haptic/tactile feedback (read: the wonderful feeling that comes from actually pushing a button), and it suffers from the same problem as above: you’re blind to everything around you. Waving your arms around while wearing a VR headset is a quick way to end up smacking your monitor or knocking stuff off your desk.

Game controllers are a solid option — and, quite honestly, the way most people will probably interact with VR for at least the first few years. But for simple things — like, say, watching a movie — do you really want to have to bring a controller along?

One guys’s idea, demonstrated in his proof-of-concept video below: use the Rift itself as the controller. Now, the Rift — at least, in its current pre-release form — has no buttons… but it does have an accelerometer. With this hack, you’d move your head around to “look” at whatever you want to select, then “knock” on the headset to select it. An accelerometer built-in to the headset picks up your knock, and that gets translated into a button press.

Is it a perfect solution? Nah — at the very least, knocking on a big thing attached to your head is probably a bit jarring. But it’s pretty darn neat, and shows there’s still plenty of ways to think about input with regards to virtual reality.

(With that said: I do hope the final Rift has some sort of basic input mechanism built in, be it a button, or a touch sensitive panel, or something way more clever than anything I could think of. Oh, and a camera, for augmented reality. Oh! And a machine that prints money and tells me I’m great.)","People may become more isolated from others and the world around them. When people are constantly donning a headset and looking into a virtual world, they are not interacting with the people and things around them in the real world.

173,Beat Saber Is a VR Workout for People Who Don't Like Exercise,"Very few people know what it’s like to be in an actual sword fight. Yet, thanks to Star Wars, two volumes of Kill Bill, and loads of other pop culture blade duels, it’s easy for anyone to feel like they know how to joust. It’s easy to imagine the moments of sustained, perpetual grace, both combatants acting in perfect harmony with their bodies. In these envisioned moments, there's sweat and blood, but there's also an imperceptible sense of power, a sense of something profound being unlocked with every movement.

It’s hard to know if any sort of actual martial art or fencing school would let me act out that fantasy. But Beat Saber does.

Released last year by Beat Games, after a few months in Early Access on Steam, Beat Saber is one of the most popular titles on every virtual reality platform with which it's compatible. Every recommendation list features it; it's won a ton of accolades, including Game Developers Choice Awards, SXSW Gaming Awards, and DICE Awards. That said, its premise is jarringly simple: In a VR environment, blocks the size of your head fly at you along a three-dimensional series of tracks. Your controllers, whether you're in an Oculus headset or a Vive or using PlayStation VR's Move controllers, are the handles of lightsabers. To the beat of the music, you cut your blocks with one of your lightsabers. Each block has a color, corresponding to one of your lightsabers, and tells you what direction you need to cut from.

That's it. It's Dance Dance Revolution or Guitar Hero transposed into virtual reality and translated into an intuitive, fanciful means of interaction. But it's also hypnotic—so precise, and so adaptable to the skill level of the player that most people can easily pick it up, understand it, and feel the thrill of it. Putting a rhythm game in VR is an idea a lot of creators have had, but Beat Saber is the first game made with the polish and style necessary to make that idea feel greater than the sum of its age-old parts. The initial music selection is limited, but the developers have released expansion packs, and thanks to an extensive modding scene you can play with thousands more songs mapped by passionate fans. It's possible to lose days to this rabbit hole.

But that's not what makes Beat Saber unique. Beat Saber is special because of how it makes me feel about moving.

LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Virtual Reality

Let me explain: I bought Beat Saber, and the Oculus Quest that I'm playing it on, for a very specific purpose. This was a ploy to get myself to exercise. I'm not as healthy or as mobile as I want to be, and I've struggled my entire life to find ways to exercise that feel good enough to be part of a sustainable routine. I knew my experiences in VR had felt good, and that I found moving around in those spaces interesting. Playing brief stints of more strenuous VR games had been similarly satisfying, so I figured I’d get a lot out of something like Beat Saber, which was purportedly both addictive and strenuous.

That was one of the promises of VR according to advocates and manufacturers, right? It was a means, like the Nintendo Wii before it, to both play and exercise. When researching my choice, I found forums of enthusiastic Beat Saber players, VR enthusiast sites, and a whole gaggle of sweaty white-dude VR YouTubers prophesying that not only was Beat Saber excellent, it was a workout, with some advocates even saying that it helped them lose weight and get into shape.

I've only been at my Beat Saber routine for a couple of weeks, so I can't say with any confidence whether or not those claims of efficacy are true. But I can say for certain that Beat Saber is a workout. It's a workout, however, in a way that I've never experienced a workout before. It comes in waves, brief moments of inspiration that become less brief the more I find myself getting better at the game. In these moments, I feel something about myself that I can't remember ever experiencing before. I feel—graceful. I feel light. My hands move in rapid-fire patterns, slicing blocks the moment they come into my reach. I just … move. I cut, I dodge periodic obstacles. I weave in and out of complex routines, movements that would be dances if I did them without a headset on. I feel harmonious, full of some invisible power and just a bit of aggressive malice as I work my way through block after block. I feel, in short, like my imagination's version of a sword-fighting hero.

This is what Beat Saber did for me, and why I'd play it even if I wasn't also working up a sweat: It gave me a type of power fantasy I've never had before. Games have been making me feel empowered and engaged my entire life. But this one didn't just make me feel powerful. It made it feel powerful to move. Made me feel like more than just my weary flesh. Maybe my personal imagined version of movement isn't so far from the truth after all.

174,This Augmented Reality First Person Shooter Looks Pretty Awesome,"It turns your everyday surroundings into a ""world-scale"" first person shooter.

World-Scale Shooter

Branding agency Pixeloco announced last month that it’s developing an augmented reality game that turns your everyday surroundings into a “world-scale” first-person shooter.

In a promotional video, players run around their city gathering pixelated powerups, shooting at each other, and taking cover behind real-world cars and buildings and even shooting digital bullet holes into them. Details on the game are scarce, but the prototype demo shows a compelling vision of how mixed reality could — at long last — find its way into popular usage.

No-Scope

The game relies on existing augmented reality infrastructure. Players in the video mount their phones gun-shaped gun controllers built by Arkade Games, and the actual AR environment is built with crowdsourced digital mapping tech from the mixed reality company Immersal, lending some credibility to the game’s early demo showcase.

In the game itself, players use the setup to grab powerups or riddle their opponents and surroundings with digital bullets.

Running Wild

An augmented game where players shoot up their environments, however, raises some important questions about how they might interact with the unknowing public around them.

While the gun controllers are brightly-colored pieces of plastic, it seems unlikely that any passersby would immediately understand that they’re witnessing a video game, so the open-world type of play shown in the video seems a bit unrealistic.

175,The War on the Disturbingly Real Trolls in Virtual Reality,"Experiences like that were one reason that Kelly and coworkers at AltSpaceVR formed an all-female team last year to design a feature called the “personal space bubble.” It causes other people’s avatars to disappear and become inaudible if they get closer than about an arm’s length of your own virtual body, and makes you invisible and inaudible to them. The bubble is active by default, but you can turn it off if you do want to get closer to someone (Kelly says that air kissing is an important greeting between friends in AltSpace).

AltSpace also lets you mute specific avatars to prevent you from hearing each other, or to block them, making you and them mutually invisible. The company also has a human “concierge” available 24/7 to field reports of unsavory activity.

High Fidelity launched its own version of the personal space bubble early this year, and has its own mute and block features. Rosedale says the company saw a slight uptick in bad behavior toward others after the company’s software became available on the video-game app store Steam in November, leading to an influx of new users. As well as offering public virtual spaces, AltSpace and High Fidelity both let users create private places to mingle with others, but since so few people own VR hardware, for most people, socializing by necessity involves meeting strangers.

He and Kelly both say that VR trolls are in the vast minority, and argue that they will become less of a problem as more people become used to the technology and the culture of virtual-reality spaces becomes more established. “VR has created a different space and so [users] are figuring out what the rules of that space are,” says Kelly.

Rosedale says that improvements to VR hardware and the activities on offer in virtual worlds will also help people be more friendly. “When you get into a lot of these VR environments, there's nothing that you can change or do other than yell at people,” he says. “If you give people a lot of creative freedom, then people get along better.”

Raph Koster, a high-profile video-game designer whose hits include the multiplayer online game Star Wars Galaxies, thinks VR trolling is in fact likely to get worse. He used a keynote at the gaming industry’s giant GDC conference in San Francisco earlier this month to warn that VR companies need to do more than offer victims defensive tools such as space bubbles and mute features. He says companies will have to start more actively curating, investigating, and punishing bad user behavior, for example by hiring dedicated staff.

“If anything, the behavior now is better than it will ever be,” says Koster of the current moment in social VR. He says his experience launching Ultima Online, one of the first virtual environments that could host thousands of people at once, showed that when more people start visiting a virtual space, trolling becomes more of a problem because they feel more anonymous. “When you get strangers bumping up against one another they behave more poorly,” he says. “Peer pressure is one of the things that keeps people behaving well.”","The potential for users to engage in bad behavior towards others.

176,New Sex Toys Sync Up to Virtual Reality Porn,"You knew this was coming, even if you didn't want to believe it: A sex-toy company and a VR porn outfit are creating a way to enjoy synced-up virtual reality sex. And while virtual-reality headsets haven’t yet hit the mainstream, Lovense and VirtualRealPorn hope their collaborative stroke of genius can thrust VR into the spotlight.

[We should note that most links in this story are varying degrees of NSFW.]

The trick involves using a Bluetooth dongle, specially coded VR videos, and Lovense's Max and Nora sex toys to make the toys' vibrations and rotations sync with the VR action seen in your headset. The idea is to make you feel exactly what you're seeing---in real-time and in all the right places.

According to Lovense, the girthier portion of its rabbit-style Nora toy will vibrate to match the speed of male performers in VirtualRealPorn videos, while the smaller arm will buzz “every time the performers' bodies collide.” Likewise, its Fleshlight-like Max toy will use air pumps to contract in accordance with the female performer’s alacrity, and the whole device will vibrate when... well, you get the idea.

This delicate dance between hardware and video certainly promises a deeper level of immersion. But is it just too much trouble? It's quite a lot of gear for something that, for most people, remains an analog exercise. However, Lovense says the main thing that makes the next-gen process cumbersome is the VR goggles. Once you've strapped those on, the company figures, you might as well go all-out and sync it to some toys. Right?

“Viewing virtual porn is more work and requires more components compared to viewing regular porn,” says Lovense founder Dan Liu. “But viewing regular porn is sometimes too much work, too.

The news organization launched ABC News VR today in the hopes of doing just that, with an assist from virtual reality tech company Jaunt. For ABC's first VR project, viewers can immerse themselves in a story about Syria to see the streets and sights in a way that they wouldn't be able experience otherwise without visiting the war zone.

""In early August, Alexander Marquardt and his team traveled to Damascus to explore the secret holding rooms where curators are working tirelessly to protect and preserve Syria’s endangered antiquities,"" ABC News president James Goldston wrote in a note to staff. ""From the Damascus Citadel and Souk to the Umayyad Mosque and the National Museum, [Marquardt] transports viewers into the story, providing a depth of reporting—and a personal guide—unlike anything we’ve done before.""

Viewers can watch the immersive news report on ABC's website, but for the true VR experience you need to download the Jaunt app to your phone and view the broadcast in a basic VR rig such as Google Cardboard.

178,Zapping Your Skull Could Alleviate Virtual-Reality Motion Sickness,"The kind of electrical stimulation behind the technology—known as galvanic vestibular stimulation, since it affects your sense of balance—isn’t a new idea; it’s long been looked at as a way to study balance. But it’s becoming increasingly popular as a potential fix for discomfort in the nascent field of consumer virtual reality: Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has spoken about trying it out, and Samsung in March revealed that it’s been building electrode-containing headphones called Entrim 4D that aim to help with motion sickness in VR while letting you feel a sense of motion.

Animation shows how Mayo Clinic technology that includes electrical pulses on the head synchronized with motion viewed on a display can make you feel like you’re moving even if you’re sitting still.

Mayo Clinic researchers say they’ve tried the technology out in their lab by showing people videos shot from a first-person perspective of things like a roller-coaster ride or mountain bike ride, which are viewed on flat displays and virtual-reality headsets. Algorithms extract motion data from each frame, which is sent on to the viewer—who’s wearing electrodes on the forehead, nape of the neck, and behind the ears—as electrical pulses meant to give a sense of things like pitch, yaw, and roll.

“The level and degree of presence that the technology conveys when you’re watching a sequence with galvanic vestibular stimulation, and when someone switches it off, is quite striking,” says Jan Stepanek, co-director of Mayo Clinic’s aerospace medicine and vestibular research laboratory.

Michael Cevette, also a co-director of the lab, says researchers studied the electrical signals of subjects’ stomach muscles to look for early signs of motion sickness when using the technology, and they determined that the combination of algorithms and electrical stimulus suppressed these symptoms.

Paul Dizio, an assistant professor at Brandeis University whose work looks at people’s motor control and spatial orientation, is skeptical. He says there is plenty of evidence that galvanic vestibular stimulation can reduce motion sickness, but that there’s not enough data to know how accurately you can control the kinds of directional sensations people feel from it.

He also notes that there can be side effects from using it like a phantom flashbulb effect, a tactile tingling sensation, or a feeling of champagne bubbles in your mouth. And he says that if someone is moving her or his head around in virtual reality while using the technology, it could create more issues.

“Plus you have to have these big electrodes on your head,” he adds. “Maybe that’s fine for a pilot that’s devoted to training of some kind, but again, it’s not without costs.”","Virtual reality has been shown to cause motion sickness in some users.

179,Lonely? Try fondling Augmented Reality Cyber Maid Alice,"Augmented reality (AR), the combination of virtual worlds and reality, is a cool concept that leads to useful applications in navigation systems, medicine, architecture and many other fields. Geisha Tokyo Entertainment Inc. [JP] now found a way to help all single otaku overcome their problems in finding a real girl friend.

Their alternative to heal loneliness 2.0 is called “Dennou Figure ARis”, or “Cyber Figure Alice” in English. This is how it works: Buyers receive the AR software, 2 cybersticks and 2 cybercubes. Put one of the cubes in front of the computer, point a webcam at it and the screen will display a 3D image of Alice standing on top of the cube.

Using the cyber sticks, you can then “touch”, caress and (naturally) peep at your new girl friend. It is even possible to undress Alice and change her clothes.

This unbelievable example of otaku madness will be sold in Japan starting this fall. As there will most probably no language barriers, I assume “Cyber Figure Alice” will be soon offered by American and European web shops specialized in Otaku products as well.

180,How to Avoid Real Objects While in a Virtual World,"“You want to be able to immerse yourself, but you also want to be able to know if something is approaching you,” said Occipital cofounder and CEO Jeff Powers. “Otherwise it’s very disconcerting, because you may run into a wall.”

The company already sells a $379 sensor similar to Microsoft’s Kinect that straps to an iPad and scans rooms and objects in 3-D. It can be used with the company’s software developer kit to build and interact with virtual- and augmented-reality apps, and includes the ability to track your position (whether you’re walking forward, backward, or crouching) without mapping the world around you in advance.

Occipital’s sensor works by projecting a laser pattern onto your immediate environment. Its infrared camera picks up that pattern and uses it to measure the distance to objects in the scene so that software can rebuild those objects in three dimensions. To add bits of the real world to a virtual one, Occipital takes video captured by the regular camera on the iPad (or, in a demonstration I saw using a different kind of sensor mount, an iPhone) and measures its depth; when an object in the real world—say a trash can—comes within a preset distance, the software will basically cut out the image of the can and insert it atop the 3-D virtual scene.

Occipital’s 3-D sensor, shown mounted to an iPhone attached to a headset.

Occipital plans to make the reality-adding feature available to developers within the next few weeks, Powers said, and will also let them know how to obtain a 3-D printed mount for the iPhone.

I got a look at what Occipital is trying to do during the Augmented World Expo in Santa Clara, California, this week. Powers placed a Homido headset onto my head—basically a generic version of Samsung’s Gear VR headset, which requires a smartphone to show virtual reality apps—into which he had slid an iPhone 6 that was connected to an Occipital 3-D sensor and had a wide-angle lens atop its normal rear camera. The view within Occipital’s virtual world was odd: I was standing within a vast, mostly empty gray room with yellowy dust particles slowly falling all around me, but after walking forward a few feet, the gray expanse was interrupted by a pixelated-looking black railing that appeared in front of me. Unlike the room, the railing was the real thing, marking the edge of the floor we were standing on in the Santa Clara Convention Center.

A moment later, Powers walked in front of me, and when he got within three or four feet, I could see him from head to torso, roughly, through the goggles: pixelated and rendered in black and white, but looking more like an actual human than an animated one. It was strange, but compelling; I completed much of the rest of our interview with the headset over my eyes.

Though Powers, the railing, and everything else from the real world that invaded my virtual space was shown in black and white, Powers said it could be in color, and the distance at which physical objects start to appear is arbitrary (he illustrated this second point by pulling out a small Bluetooth remote control that, with the push of a button, showed us real objects that were farther out).

Yet while pixelated-looking people may be okay if you’re just trying to avoid smacking into things while playing virtual-reality games, Occipital will have to vastly improve the resolution of the reality it pipes in if it’s going to work for more extensive interactions between one world and another, such as in games. And users may want to ignore an object that they know is in front of them so they don’t have a railing inside the entire game.

Powers understands there’s still a long way to go, though. “This is a starting point,” he said.","People may start to ignore real-world objects that they know are in front of them. For example, if someone is playing a virtual reality game and there is a real-world object in their way, they may choose to ignore it and walk right into it. This could lead to people getting injured or even killed if they are not paying attention to their surroundings.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/06/12/11221/how-to-avoid-real-objects-while-in-a-virtual-world/,2015-06-12 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9946042895317078,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,User Experience & Entertainment
181,The Unholy Perfection of the 1993 Murder She Wrote VR Episode,"Remember the time Jessica Fletcher wrote a virtual-reality game for the Oculus Rift?

Don't feel bad if you don't. The episode ""A Virtual Murder"" (available on Netflix) aired in 1993 during the tenth season of Murder, She Wrote, a popular show about an elderly mystery novelist (Angela Lansbury) who stumbled onto what I will only call a disproportionate number of murders in the sleepy New England town of Cabot Cove. Set in the heady days of the early '90s, a year after the release of the VR horror film Lawnmower Man and two years before Nintendo's failed Virtual Boy headset, it involves Jessica scripting a murder mystery game called *A Murder at Hastings Rock *for a VR headset startup. The result is both very stupid and very amazing.

The episode begins with Angela talking to her BFF Seth in Cabot Cove about her game, which basically turns into a conversation between an Oculus enthusiast and your grandpa. Seth:

Now let me get this straight—you've made up an arcade game, is that it? What is it, one of those mind-numbing blast-all-the-enemy-ships games? Or perhaps it's the one where the little face goes around eating all the other little faces?

I'll grant Seth the space shooters, but the second option is either a terrible description of Pac-Man or a great description of a bad acid trip.

Although Jessica insists that virtual reality is ""very fresh"" (as so many things were in the '90s), Seth continues to pooh-pooh Jessica's work as a ""children's game,"" to which she quickly gets as defensive as a reddit commenter: ""This isn't just for children. It's partly a game, partly an environment. It's really quite an experience. You wear these electronic googles that are really rather like little TV screens... and suddenly you're in this world that exists only in a computer, except it feels quite real. It's a bit disorienting, as if you're visiting this strange, almost alien space. It's rather wonderful. You're completely surrounded by it, moving through it, but you're simply standing there.""

Which honestly sounds almost exactly like what I said after I tried the Oculus Rift.

After a harp glissando and a quick video clip of an airplane, we're told Jessica is flying off to a magical land called SILICON VALLEY CALIFORNIA, where the game is being developed by a young programmer named Michael (aka Kevin Sorbo, aka Hercules) at a studio called Marathon Images Inc.",It can be disorienting and cause people to feel like they are in a different world.

182,The Obscure Neuroscience Problem That's Plaguing VR,"Despite virtual reality’s recent renaissance, the technology still has some obvious problems. One, you look like a dumbass using it. Two, the stomach-churning mismatch between what you see and what you feel contributes to “virtual reality sickness."" But there’s another, less obvious flaw that could add to that off-kilter sensation: an eye-focusing problem called vergence-accommodation conflict. It’s only less obvious because, well, you rarely experience it outside of virtual reality.

At SIGGRAPH in Los Angeles this week, Stanford professor Gordon Wetzstein and his colleagues are presenting a new head-mounted display that minimizes the vergence-accommodation conflict. This isn’t just some esoteric academic problem. Leading VR companies like Oculus and Microsoft know all too well their headsets are off, and Magic Leap, the super secret augmented reality company in Florida, is betting the house on finding a solution first. “It’s an exciting area of research,” says Martin Banks, a vision scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “I think it’s going to be the next big thing in displays.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=166&v=YJdMPUF8cDM

Okay okay, so what’s the big deal with the vergence-accommodation conflict? Two things happen when you simply “look” at an object. First, you point your eyeballs. If an object is close, your eyes naturally converge on it; if it’s far, they diverge. Hence, vergence. If your eyes don’t line up correctly, you end up seeing double.

The second thing that happens is the lenses inside your eyes focus on the object, aka accommodation. Normally, vergence and accommodation are coupled. “The visual system has developed a circuit where the two response talk to each other,” says Banks. “That makes perfect sense in the natural environment. They’re both trying to get to the same distance, so why wouldn’t they talk to one another?” In other words, your meat brain has figured out a handy shortcut for the real world.

Strap on an Oculus Rift or Samsung Gear VR, though, and all bets are off. These stereoscopic headsets create 3D images by showing the left and right eye images that are slightly offset—the more offset, the closer an object appears. That means your eyes are always accommodating to the screen strapped on your face, but they’re converging to a distance further off. Your eyes aren’t dumb; it’s totally possible to uncouple accommodation and convergence, but they won’t be happy about it. And they’ll be downright rebelling after a few hours.","It can cause virtual reality sickness. This is because the vergence-accommodation conflict can cause the eyes to become strained and the brain to become confused. The article mentions that this problem is not just an esoteric academic problem, but is something that leading VR companies are aware of and are trying to solve.",https://www.wired.com/2015/08/obscure-neuroscience-problem-thats-plaguing-vr/,2015-08-11 19:18:36+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9952123165130616,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Health & Wellbeing
183,VR Shouldn't Just Be Isolating—Here's How It Can Be Social,"A few weeks ago, at SXSW, I was walking down the street in Austin when I saw something that totally freaked me out. A man was seated in the back of a pedicab, his head turning left to right as he took in the views. Only he wasn’t looking at the real world. Strapped to his head, covering the top half of his face like a pair of ski goggles, was a Samsung Gear VR headset.

I had no idea what this guy was looking at, but I did know we were seeing different things. Where I saw trees, the blue sky, and a throng of badge-wearing conference goers, this man saw... something else. Call me sensitive, but I found the experience a little jarring. VR's immersive potential is, of course, its most compelling feature. But total immersion can also be isolating---not just for the person in the headset, but for the people standing near him.

“There’s a discrepancy between inclusion and immersion"" says Markus Wierzoch, a designer at the Seattle studio Artefact. He and his team believe the first generation of virtual reality headsets lack important, human-centered features---features that would afford not only immersive experiences, but also, when necessary, communication with the outside world.

Maybe you’re thinking, isn’t escaping reality exactly the point of VR? And you’re not wrong. But the way Artefact’s designers see it, the virtual reality experiences of the future will shift along a spectrum of social to solitary, and the design of the headgear (not to mention gameplay) needs to reflect that. “Even for the most immersive experience, we think there needs to be room for including others,” Wierzoch says. To show you what they mean, Wierzoch and his team created two concept headsets they believe could be possible by 2020.

Between Two Worlds

The concepts---Shadow and Light---are designed for two different experiences. Shadow, a hoodie with a built-in, cap-like mask, is designed for maximum immersion. It runs off a mini wearable computer, making it totally wireless.

Artefact

Shadow is geared toward hardcore gamers who can pull the hoodie over their head and immediately engage with their virtual world while signaling they'd rather not be disturbed. Still, Artefact’s hoodie has a handful of aspirational technologies that help players stay connected to the real world. A built-in front-facing camera tracks gestures and streams live video to provide players a sense of where other people are in the room. The mask also has an external screen that will display to non-wearers what the player is seeing. This is a high-tech take on what VR companies are referring to as a ""social screen,"" or a secondary screen that allows those not in VR to share in the experience. Artefact doubled down on the idea of building communication between players and non players by designing a set of virtual eyes that glow on the exterior screen to signal what mode the player is in.","There is a risk of isolation and loneliness with virtual reality if people use it as a way to escape reality. This is because they are not interacting with the people and world around them. Artefact's Shadow concept headset is designed for maximum immersion, which could lead to players being cut off from the outside world. While the built-in front-facing camera and external screen help players stay connected to others, there is still a risk that players will become too engrossed in their virtual world and lose touch with reality.",https://www.wired.com/2016/04/vr-shouldnt-just-isolating-heres-can-social/,2016-04-01 16:20:52+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9909018278121948,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
184,The Oculus Rift Made Me Believe I Could Fly,"Yesterday, I flew over downtown San Francisco. I swooped past the Transamerica Pyramid, taking care not to get speared, and winged it out towards the water. A heavy fog covered the bay, as usual, so I decided to head back into the city. I dove sharply, and the wind started whipping across my face. I slipped under the Bay Bridge, banked hard and promptly slammed into a warehouse. The wind died, and my screen went black.

I was strapped into Birdly, a full-body flight simulator designed to make you forget you're not a bird. ""Press the red buttons and pump your arms to start soaring again,"" said Max Rheiner, the Swiss artist responsible for my in-flight experience this week at Swissnex. (Birdly flew here from its birthplace at the Zurich University of the Arts.) The reason that Rheiner could make this simulator now, and not 20 years ago when he first dreamed of helping humans feel like birds, is the arrival of the Oculus Rift. The Rift is the first virtual reality headset with two key features: It's cheap, and it doesn't make you want to vomit. Now that there's a way to provide accurate head-tracking at low enough latency to prevent motion sickness, people who were raised on the promise of virtual reality are starting to experiment.

Humans dreamed of flying like a bird for centuries before hot air balloons finally took people into the skies. At first the designers of Birdly took the dream a bit too literally and used a physics engine to model airflow around virtual wings. But it turns out to be hard for humans to fly like an actual bird, learning to flap their wings at the right angle and catch thermals to spiral up. To simulate the effortlessness of dream flight, Rheiner made the interface more metaphorical and intuitive. By twisting your arm you control the pitch of the wing: Tip up to soar higher, and tip down to dive. Catch the air with one hand to bank. To climb faster, you can vigorously pump both wings. Pistons provide realistic resistance, and a fan is calibrated to make the windspeed match your virtual velocity.

Climb on! Joshua Batson/WIRED

It's admittedly a bit awkward to climb onto Birdly. You bend over a padded frame, strap on a tight headset and headphones, then hook your hands into wooden wings. But then the screen flips on and you find yourself floating above the city, watching your bird-shadow drifting across the rooftops. If you crane your neck, you can see your brown feathers ruffling in the breeze. After a few seconds, flying feels natural.

The individual components of the system are still a bit rough, but together they provide an amazing experience. The screen on the Rift was more pixellated than my smartphone, and I had to move my head slowly to keep the landscape in sync. If this were only a visual tour of the San Francisco skyline, I might have gotten a bit nauseated. But just like the driver of a car almost never feels nauseated even when the passengers in the backseat are clutching their stomachs, I felt comfortable because of the tactile control and physical feedback. I feel like Birdly managed to just get past some threshold of pleasurability and plausibility, so that I wanted to keep flying all night. It also made me impatient to race around faster, diving and swooping and barrel rolling. I wanted to fly over the rest of California, and to see it all with perfect resolution.

Given that Birdly was made by a team of just three people working part-time since receiving a Rift development kit in November, I expect that progress will be swift. For example, the experience will soon include smells. Rheiner, working with a Dutch fragrance designer, built a rig to emit little pumps of scented alcohol as you fly. But a realistic cityscape has to include hot asphalt and car exhaust, and it's tricky to deliver a whiff of those that won't knock you out of the sky.

While Rheiner's team was aiming for art, there might also be a future in travel and fitness. Imagine spending an afternoon flying through the Grand Canyon---a beautiful trip, and if you need to flap your wings the whole time to stay aloft, a serious work out. Before a walk to your basement can replace a helicopter ride in Hawaii, though, a compendium of detailed 3-D maps would be required. Promisingly, Google Earth sent 20 people to visit Birdly last week.","Virtual reality has the potential to make people more sedentary. If people can fly like birds in their living room, they may be less likely to go outside and get exercise. Additionally, if people can visit far-flung destinations without leaving their home, they may be less likely to travel. This could have a negative impact on the tourism industry.",https://www.wired.com/2014/08/oculus-rift-birdly-fly/,2014-08-01 17:39:47+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.912534475326538,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
185,Opioids Haven't Solved Chronic Pain. Maybe Virtual Reality Can,"When someone walks or rolls into the emergency department at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles with food stuck in their throat, the ER staff calls someone like Brennan Spiegel. As a gastroenterologist, food-pulling-out is something he’s uniquely equipped to do. So when he got the call one day to see a young man admitted with something caught in his esophagus, he was already mentally preparing for a trip to the operating room. But when he arrived, there was something off about the way the patient was beating his chest with his fist. “This guy’s not choking,” Spiegel thought, “he’s having a panic attack.”

So rather than calling for a gurney and an OR transfer, Spiegel reached for a pair of virtual reality goggles, pulled them over the patient’s eyes, and dialed up a scene of a beach in Hawaii. Within a few seconds the patient stopped struggling. A few minutes later he had stopped moving entirely—not even when prodded. Slightly alarmed, Spiegel began to peel the goggles off the patient’s face. Tears came pouring out. “I’ve been thinking about my whole life in there,” the patient said. “I feel like it’s spinning out of control.”

A short while later, the patient was discharged to psychiatric care. There had never been any food in his throat. The mind can play tricks like that. Luckily, VR can play tricks right back.

Cedars-Sinai is one of an increasing number of hospitals testing how virtual reality could improve patient outcomes. Spiegel is one of the clinical researchers leading that charge. He’s focusing his efforts on something much more universal than the occasional psychosomatic suffocation: pain. Over the past few years he’s conducted clinical trials that show a pair of 3-D goggles can reduce the experience of pain—all kinds, from joint injuries to cancer—by a quarter.

Now, he’s testing the technology for treating chronic pain—the kind that afflicts more than 25 million Americans. All too often, addictive painkillers are the only treatment option for those patients. And with opioids claiming the lives of nearly 100 people every day, doctors are scrambling to find non-addictive alternatives. Virtual reality might soon be one of them, if the science can show it really works.","It can be used to mask pain rather than address the underlying cause. This can lead to patients becoming addicted to painkillers or other drugs in order to cope with their chronic pain. Additionally, if VR is used to treat chronic pain, it is important to ensure that patients do not become too reliant on it as a crutch.",https://www.wired.com/story/opioids-havent-solved-chronic-pain-maybe-virtual-reality-can/,2017-11-02 11:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9951777458190918,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Health & Wellbeing
186,12-Year-Old Develops Slenderman Phobia After Seeing Him in VR,"We need to think long and hard about what we want to get out of a so-called ""metaverse.""

Technophobia

As Facebook and other companies take steps to build a “metaverse” and strive to make virtual and mixed reality experiences as much of an all-encompassing tech as the internet is today, experts are sharing concerns about safety, both during the experiences themselves and in terms of the impact they can have on our offline lives.

One 12-year-old girl told Slate that she now has a “phobia” of Slenderman, the fictional, child-killing figure that once inspired a real-life stabbing, after watching a VR experience of the supernatural figure stalking the viewer. She added that she regularly watched YouTube videos of Slenderman without issue, but has been afraid of the character popping up and attacking her in real life ever since making the switch to VR. It’s a jarring story, and one that illustrates how VR can, without proper safeguards, be a dangerous presence in our lives.

“It’s hard to sleep,” the girl told Slate.

Die in the Game

Existing research on virtual and mixed reality suggests that traumatic or abusive experiences in a VR environment are far more damaging than those in other digital settings, Slate notes. Despite its many promises, which include being used as a treatment to reduce phobias, a VR “metaverse” could end up as just another toxic ecosystem filled with as much vitriol — and exploitation — as the internet is today.

Citing a study published in the Journal of Children and Media in 2017, Slate argues that VR can cause experiences that are perhaps too powerful, and most importantly perceived as being too real, for children to use the tech without proper safeguards and regulations.

Kids are impressionable, and VR is convincing, University of Texas, Austin VR expert Jakki Bailey told Slate. Whether it’s a terrifying video of Slenderman or advertising and targeting practices that could become even more sinister than what we have today, the human impacts of spending time in a virtual world can be profound. That, Slate argues, means we should figure out what kind of virtual world we want to build before Facebook decides for us.

187,How Apps and VR Therapy Can Help OCD Patients,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, it's become not only acceptable but recommended that we wash our hands frequently, as per Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. That is, any time we're in a public place and before or after touching our face. That includes after pumping gas, opening the mailbox, touching door handles—it's endless, and it won’t end when everyone’s vaccinated and we start to recover from the pandemic.

For people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), this isn't something to laugh about—there's a vast difference between handwashing to stop the spread of a virus and handwashing that's obsessive. The Mayo Clinic defines OCD as ""a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). It comes down to the level of impairment and the degree to which these obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause distress.

But OCD is not just handwashing, and it's not just a personality quirk or a way to describe someone who is “type-A”; it's a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder. Between 2 and 3 percent of Americans will suffer from OCD at some point in their lives, and it's estimated to be the 10th leading cause of disability in the world. The good news is that OCD is treatable, but the first step is receiving an accurate diagnosis.

How Do You Know If It’s OCD, Depression, or Anxiety?

Amy Mariaskin, clinical psychologist and director of the Nashville OCD & Anxiety Treatment Center, is also the artist behind the Instagram account @OCDNashville. She takes complex mental-health concepts and turns them into comics, which has led people to recognize symptoms in themselves and seek treatment.

This is what happened to Stephen Smith, CEO of startup NOCD, during his sophomore year of college. Smith was an award-winning quarterback and had an active social life, but he started having anxious thoughts that started in one area and quickly seeped into other areas. The intrusive thoughts took over, and Smith left school and moved home to his parents' house. Within six months, he went from being a vibrant college quarterback to being homebound.

During this time, Smith received five misdiagnoses. With each misdiagnosis he received treatment, but because they weren’t for OCD, they made his symptoms worse. Marla Deibler, founder and executive director of the Center for Emotional Health, says ""The data we have suggests it can take an average of 13 to 15 years to get a proper diagnosis and treatment.”

Mariaskin says many patient in her clinic had been treated before for something other than OCD, only to find their symptoms worseneing because they didn’t receive the right therapy. ""Many of them find out they have OCD through engagement with media,"" she says, “We joke at the clinic that our biggest referrer is Google.”

After being diagnosed with OCD, the next step is finding treatment. Ash Nadkarni, Harvard Medical School instructor and director of wellness at Brigham & Women's Hospital, says, ""In one study examining patients with OCD who experienced barriers to treatment, 40 percent of patients had not received treatment. Many patients received treatment outside of the gold standard for treatment and undertake ‘talk therapy,’ which lacks the same empirical support as exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy.""

What Is Exposure and Response Prevention?

ERP is the gold-standard of care for OCD because the ""exposure"" part of the equation subjects the patient to the thoughts, images, objects, and situations that trigger the obsession, and the ""response"" part is about learning ways to resist engaging in compulsive rituals. ""The active ingredient with OCD treatment is exposure, so we want to come up with different ways for people to face their fears and learn to sit with the discomfort,” says Deibler.

With OCD, as with phobias, there is often a ritual or safety behavior involved that the patient thinks is helping them cope with their fear and make them feel safer, but the rituals actually reinforce the fear. Michael Ambrose, licensed clinical psychologist at My OCD Care, says, ""We're not trying to habituate to the fear, but instead we're trying to build a second learning pathway. It's important to interact with things that can disconfirm your fear.""","It can increase feelings of isolation and loneliness. This is because when people are immersed in a virtual world, they are not interacting with the real world and real people. This can lead to people feeling like they are not connected to others, which can trigger feelings of loneliness and isolation.",https://www.wired.com/story/apps-vr-help-ocd-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-patients/,2021-06-02 13:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9953670501708984,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
188,An Augmented-Reality Climbing Wall That Guides Your Ascent,"Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Pioneering rock climber John Sherman, who practically invented the discipline of bouldering, once wrote, ""The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders (or a climbing wall).""

That's certainly true, but it doesn't mean climbing can't benefit from a little modern technology. That's what two Finnish researchers had in mind when they came up with the concept for a climbing wall boosted by augmented reality. By combining a projector, a motion-tracking camera, and 3D game-building software, they were able to illuminate a climbing wall to illustrate the ideal route or provide hints to help climbers choose the best option for their next move.

Bouldering, as you might guess, can be done outdoors on actual boulders, but it's commonly practiced in climbing gyms where climbers scramble from hold to hold above a padded landing area without a safety rope. The sport is heavily social, as people work together to solve a particular ""problem"" and climb a route successfully.

Encouraging such collaboration was one goal of the augmented wall project, said Dr. Raine Kajastila, a post-doctoral researcher at Aalto University's Department of Media Technology in Finland, an avid climber for for nearly 15 years.

""Anyone can make a route and share it with others who can easily try them even on a different day,"" Kajastila said. ""The social contact is not restricted to the same time and place.""

Kajastila and Perttu Hämäläinen, a professor of computer games at Aalto, built a 13-foot by 8-foot climbing wall in their lab to test their idea. One concept used projectors to show routes up the wall, which appeared as a series of lines with circles around preferred holds. In another prototype, the program captured the climber's movement with an instant replay capability. There was even a built-in game that required climbers to avoid an animated chainsaw chasing them around the wall.","While the augmented wall project had good intentions, one of the main unintended consequences is that it creates a virtual barrier between climbers. By using projectors to show routes up the wall, climbers are more likely to stick to those routes and less likely to explore on their own. This could lead to climbers becoming more reliant on technology and less capable of problem-solving on their own.",https://www.wired.com/2014/10/augmented-reality-climbing-wall-guides-ascent/,2014-10-06 10:30:05+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9950634837150574,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
189,VR Will Soon Revolutionize How Football Players Train,"In a soundproof room at the Dallas Cowboys’ training facility, players can pull on a pair of goggles and get instantly transported to the practice field. The Cowboys are one of six NFL and 10 college teams using virtual reality technology to give players more of what Dallas coach Jason Garrett called “mental reps”: Opportunities to recognize plays, formations and opponents’ movements in a realistic setting (and without worrying about whether you’re going to be tackled).

From inside the Oculus Rift headset, players get a 3-D look at the field while headphones provide realistic sound. Teams capture the footage by filming their practices with 360-degree cameras, so the experience inside the VR headset looks and sounds like the real thing rather than a video game.

The setup is provided by STRIVR Labs, which has grown over the past year with the speed of the best startups in Silicon Valley. That’s not necessarily surprising, given that STRIVR was born where many startups begin, on the campus of Stanford University.

In 2014, Derek Belch combined his activities as an assistant football coach and as a graduate student working on a virtual reality project to create an early version of the system. Stanford used that first footage to train their quarterbacks, and by the end of the year, Cardinal coach David Shaw agreed that Belch’s future lay in business, rather than on the sidelines.

“I was on the staff and he basically kicked me off and said, 'Go do this,'” Belch said. Shaw even invested some of his own money to help get the business off the ground. Since then, STRIVR has expanded from a training tool for quarterbacks to include footage for every position. It’s particularly useful in college, where practice time is limited to 20 hours per week. Both starters and backups can squeeze in more repetitions in the same amount of time.

“We have been using virtual reality for about a month now and have found it to be very helpful in our game preparation,” Temple Coach Matt Rhule said in November, when his Owls were 8-1 and ranked #21 in the country. “We are probably just scratching the surface of its capabilities, but our quarterbacks, offensive line, linebackers, and safeties are really getting the benefit of extra practice reps each week.”

In recent months, more sports have jumped on board as well, with pro basketball and hockey teams signing up for the service. The technology is moving forward quickly, Belch said, so that over the next 10 to 20 years, the simulations will allow companies to map the environment down to the micrometer, creating more and more high-fidelity worlds. The opportunity lies in creating an experience that keeps up with the technology.

“One of the issues that we remind all the coaches is that everybody imagines this is something like a Madden game. While that may make a lot of sense, your brain just doesn't respond to that stuff the right way,” Belch said. “So even when it gets really good, it may not be good enough. We're constantly saying, 'That's technologically possible, but it's not a good experience, so we don't want to do it.'”","It may lead to players becoming too reliant on the technology. If they are not careful, they may end up relying on the virtual world to give them all the information they need, rather than learning to read the play themselves. This could lead to players becoming less instinctive and more robotic on the field.",https://www.wired.com/2015/12/vr-will-soon-revolutionize-how-football-players-train/,2015-12-30 11:55:35+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9942268133163452,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
190,Now There’s a VR Rig for Lab Animals,"How do you study the way zebrafish translate visual cues into movement, or whether mice are afraid of heights? For researchers at the Vienna Biocenter in Austria, the answer seemed obvious: build a virtual-reality rig for lab animals. So that’s exactly what they’ve done.

The new setup, called FreemoVR, is an arena whose walls and floors are made of computer displays, with 10 high-speed cameras hanging above that are able to monitor the movement of animals placed in the space. The researchers have software observe the animals' movements and quickly change the imagery shown on the displays.

So far, it seems to be pretty compelling for the critters that it's been tested on. Fruit flies that were shown virtual pillars flew in circles around them as though they were really there. Meanwhile, mice chose to walk only along raised pathways that appeared to be closer to the floor (an illusion achieved by using two sizes of checkerboard on the ground to provide a trick of perspective), just as they would in the physical world.

Details of the system, as well as results from the experiments, are published in Nature Methods. The team reckons that the setup could be used as an easier way to understand how animals respond to visual stimulation. Indeed, IEEE Spectrum reports that the lab is already investigating how differences in the brain function of fruit flies affect their responses to what they see in VR.","It may be too compelling for some animals. The fruit flies that were shown virtual pillars flew in circles around them as though they were really there, and the mice chose to walk only along raised pathways that appeared to be closer to the floor.

191,Virtual Reality Stunts Rats' Sense of Space,"If you were a rat living in a completely virtual world like in the movie The Matrix, could you tell? Maybe not, but scientists studying your brain might be able to. Today, researchers report that certain cells in rat brains work differently when the animals are in virtual reality than when they are in the real world.

The neurons in question are known as place cells, which fire in response to specific physical locations in the outside world and reside in the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for spatial navigation and memory. As you walk out of your house every day, the same place cell fires each time you reach the shrub that's two steps away from your door. It fires again when you reach the same place on your way back home, even though you are traveling in the opposite direction. Scientists have long suspected that these place cells help the brain generate a map of the world around us. But how do the place cells know when to fire in the first place?

Previous research showed that the cells rely on three different kinds of information. First, they analyze ""visual cues,"" or what you see when you look around. Then, there are what researchers call ""self-motion cues."" These cues come from how your body moves in space and are the reason you can still find your way around a room with the lights out. The final type of information is the ""proximal cues,"" which encompass everything else about the environment you're in. The smell of a bakery on your way to work, the sounds of a street jammed with traffic, and the springy texture of grass in a park are all proximal cues.

In the real world, it's extremely difficult to tease out the influence of each kind of cue. But in a virtual reality environment, scientists are able to control the kinds of information available. In this latest experiment, rats anchored to the top of a ball ran in place as movie-like images around them changed, creating the impression that they were running along a track. Their sense of place relied on visual cues from the projections and their self-motion cues, but they had to do without proximal cues like sound and smell.

When Mayank Mehta, a neurophysicist at the University of California (UC), Los Angeles, compared the activity of place cells in rats running along a real, linear track with place cell activity in the rats running in virtual reality, he saw some surprising differences. In the real world, about 45% of the rats' place cells fired at some point along the track. In virtual reality, only 22% did. ""Half of the neurons just shut up,"" he says.

What's more, the place cells seemed to have a very different relationship to space in virtual reality than in the real world. Remember that place cell that fires when you've taken two steps away from your door on your way out of your house? On a real track, the rat's version of that neuron would fire when it had taken two steps away from the start, and then again when the animal reached the same spot on its return trip. But in virtual reality, something odd happened. Rather than firing a second time when the rat reached the same place on its return trip, the cells fired when the rat was two steps away from the opposite end of the track, the authors report online today in Science. That's like the same place cell in your brain firing when you've taken two steps away from your door and then when you've taken two steps away from your car. Instead of encoding a position in absolute space, the place cell seems to be keeping track of the rat's relative distance along the (virtual) track. Mehta calls this the ""disto-code"" and says, ""This never happens in the real world.""","Place cells in rats' brains seem to function differently in virtual reality than in the real world. In particular, the cells fire in response to the rat's relative distance along a track in virtual reality, rather than in response to the rat's absolute position in space. This finding suggests that virtual reality may not be an accurate representation of reality, and may cause problems for people who rely on it for navigation or other purposes.",https://www.wired.com/2013/05/virtual-reality-spatial-sense/,2013-05-03 14:30:42+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.994914174079895,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
192,"Someone is putting VR headsets on cows, and we want to know why ...","Let’s just be up front here: yes, these pictures seem to show a cow wearing a virtual reality headset, and no, we don’t really know what’s going on here.

You may have seen these images floating around social media followed by a trail of comments like “this is the dystopian future we were warned about” and “enter the mootrix.” They purportedly show an experiment being conducted in Russia to see if giving dairy cows VR headsets can reduce anxiety and increase milk yield, but — as you might have guessed — it’s not at all clear whether this is a genuine trial or an elaborate marketing stunt.

Designers were reportedly hired to create a ‘summer field simulation’ for the cows

The story can be traced back to this (apparently serious) press release from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of the Moscow Region, which was picked up by Russian outlets like Interfax and The Moscow Times.

The reports say tests of the VR headsets are being carried out at a farm near Moscow, with the (Google-translated) release noting that the goggles have been specially adapted for a cow’s head shape and vision. VR designers were also reportedly hired to create a “unique summer field simulation program” for the animals to enjoy.

The release notes that there’s a growing trend in agriculture to focus on animals’ emotional well-being, with quality-of-life improvements like scrubbing brushes and relaxing music improving yields. So why not try VR as well? A first test of the headset showed “a decrease in anxiety and an increase in the overall emotional mood of the herd,” the release says, and a “further comprehensive study” is forthcoming. But, uh, is it? It’s not clear.

Cows probably can wear VR headsets, but that doesn’t mean they should

It’s certainly not impossible that this is a real experiment. The agricultural industry is as keen as any other to apply new technology — just look at the farmers using facial recognition on pigs! — and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone suggested VR could improve animals’ well-being. Plus, although cows don’t see like humans do, they do apparently have limited binocular vision, suggesting modified VR goggles could work on them.

On the other hand, the press release says the experiment wasn’t conducted by a university but by “Milknews.ru,” a news site for the Russian dairy industry. It also encourages readers to sign up for the upcoming “VI International Agro-Industrial Dairy Forum” where they can learn more about technology in agriculture. This suggests the VR cows might just be a good way to get attention for an otherwise run-of-the-mill conference. If so: job done.

We don’t know how deep this rabbit hole goes, but we’ve reached out to Milknews, the Moscow Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and Rusmoloko (the company running the farm where the trials reportedly took place) to see if we can get any more info.

At the end of the day, what we can say is that someone took the time to make at least one mock-up virtual reality headset for a cow and took these pictures. We don’t need to milk the story any more than that.","Although it's not clear if the VR cows story is real or not, the main unintended consequence of virtual reality being used on animals is that it could lead to them becoming more anxious and stressed. If animals are constantly being exposed to VR simulations of different environments, it could disrupt their natural behavior and cause them to become more agitated. In the case of dairy cows, this could lead to less milk being produced. While the idea of using VR to improve animal welfare is noble, it's important to make sure that any such technology is used in a way that doesn't cause more harm than good.",https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/26/20983717/vr-virtual-reality-headsets-cows-russia-vr-trial,2019-11-26 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9951372742652892,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,The Verge,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
193,Transcend VR sues investor Mike Rothenberg for fraud and breach of contract,"Mike Rothenberg has been in a heap of trouble over a series of purportedly fraudulent transactions within his investment firm Rothenberg Ventures and his virtual reality startup River Studios. Now Transcend VR, as first reported in The Wall Street Journal, is suing the venture capitalist on allegations of fraud, breach of contract and deceptive diversion of funds.

Transcend, which filed the lawsuit in the California state superior court last week, says it invested $2 million as a convertible promissory note in Bend Reality LLC (i.e. River Studios) on the belief it was the first non-founder to invest and that Rothenberg held 100 percent equity in River.

However, Transcend says Rothenberg diverted $5 million over a two-year period from “another investment” into River Studios starting in 2014, giving those investors a beneficial ownership in the virtual reality startup. Transcend maintains it was never told of this previous investment.

We’ve reached out to Mike Rothenberg to hear from him on this recent accusation but have yet to hear back, though he has maintained his innocence on similar matters. We’ve also reached out to Transcend’s lawyers for comment.

According to the suit, River also agreed it would pay back the principle of the loan with 5 percent interest on the third anniversary of the loan on the condition that if River committed any act of bankruptcy the startup would immediately repay the loan, along with the unpaid interest.

However, Transcend says Rothenberg described in emails to investors a recent loss of employees and working capital had put River Studios in “jeopardy,” writing that he now “valued River Studios ‘at cost’ and that equity investments could very well ‘disappear.'”

Rothenberg has been accused on numerous occasions of disregard for maintaining separation of funds. Transcend furthers those claims, alleging River Studios as the “alter ego of Rothenberg,” accusing him of commingling accounts and using them as “his personal bank account.”

The suit further claims Rothenberg diverted loan proceeds without investor knowledge into his personal account. An earlier TechCrunch report touching on the Transcend investment shows documentation in which Rothenberg wired $1.7 million directly to his personal bank account on the same day Transcend wired the $2 million to Bend Reality LLC.

Meanwhile, Rothenberg faces two other lawsuits from former employees and may still be under an SEC investigation for allegations of bank fraud, wire fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.

194,"As the Note 7 dies, Oculus loses face(s)","The Note 7 debacle hasn’t been good for anyone — not for Samsung, not for Android, not for consumers, not for airlines, not for fire departments, not for stylus-lovers and certainly not for Oculus.

The Facebook-owned virtual reality powerhouse currently has its entire mobile VR future pinned on the successes of Samsung’s handsets and the discontinuation of Note 7 production is likely going to stunt Oculus’s Gear VR sales (and brand) in a pretty damning way.

Today, shortly before Samsung issued a recommendation that all Note 7 users shut off their devices, Oculus disabled Note 7 support for the Gear VR. Users on Reddit discovered the message this morning.

Exploding phones admittedly do not seem ideal for a peripheral that straps the phone to your face, so the real surprise is that it took this long.

The success of the Gear VR is intimately tied to Samsung in more ways that just the phones. Samsung injected major life into the Gear VR platform by capitalizing on the excitement of the Galaxy S7 and shipping a ton of free headsets with pre-orders.

The $99 Gear VR is currently Oculus’s main touch point with consumers, most of whom have likely not even seen higher-end VR systems like the Rift. Oculus announced at their OC3 conference last week that there were over 1 million monthly active users on Gear VR, much of this likely having a lot to do with giveaways on the part of Samsung. No official numbers are out there in terms of sales, but analysts from SuperData Research estimate that while the Oculus Rift will sell just over 355 thousand units this year, there will be over 2.3 million Gear VR’s in the wild by year’s end.

Long story short, Gear VR is huge to Oculus’s brand and now the platform’s immediate future is likely going to see a very unfortunate period of slowed growth given that the next new compatible device from Samsung probably won’t emerge until next spring.

This comes as Oculus just released an upgraded model of the Gear VR specially designed to accommodate the Note 7 (while also backwards-compatible with other Galaxy models). It added a USB Type-C connection, added a bit of padding to make the experience more comfortable and opened up the slot a bit to accommodate the larger 7’s larger form factor.

With the Note 7 now deceased, no one has any explicit reason to buy the new headset; the old one will work just fine and is selling for $55 on Amazon right now, nearly half the price of the new model. For the time being, the new Gear VR is a peripheral waiting on a product.

(I’ve reached out to Oculus for comment on how the Note 7 production cease will affect the rollout of the new Gear VR and will update if I hear anything back.)

The worst thing that can happen for Oculus right now is a six month stalling of customers with brand new phones who might have been interested in checking out VR. Without a major Samsung launch to entice consumers to Oculus, for a bit the company will have to sell itself through its new content rather than piggybacking off the sales of a new smartphone.

All of this comes as Google is readying for the launch of their mobile VR platform, Daydream, which already has multiple handset makers, including Samsung, ready to build compatibility for the platform into their devices. Google’s first headset, the Daydream View, is launching next month and includes a VR motion controller. The platform capitalizes on a new VR mode in Android Nougat which brings low-latency VR to new smartphones with OLED displays.

In the end, Oculus was fortunate to make it out of this situation without any exploding storylines that incorporated a Gear VR headset, but by losing the newest phone on their rather exclusive platform, the headset maker is going to have to shift its mobile strategies if it hopes to keep hype alive for itself and the mobile virtual reality platform.","The potential for people to become addicted to VR.

195,Airbus Patents a VR Helmet That'll Make You Forget You're on a Plane,"In a world where economy-class seats are getting thinner and lavatories are shrinking, any flight longer than an hour can feel like a traveling prison. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus is abetting the shift, but a recent patent filing shows it hasn’t forgotten about you, the passenger who actually has to sit in these miserable flying cells. It’s considering helmets that will let you forget you’re in an airplane at all.

Flying can be boring or stressful, which is why airlines provide music, movies and bad TV. The next step appears to be thoroughly immersing passengers in what they’re watching. “The helmet in which the passenger houses his/her head offers him/her sensorial isolation with regard to the external environment,” reads the patent filing.

The helmets feature headphones to provide music. You can watch movies (perhaps in 3D) on the “opto-electronic” screen or possibly through “image diffusion glasses.” If you want to get some work done, turn on the virtual keyboard, which appears on your tray, don a pair of motion capture gloves, and type away. The helmet could even pipe in different odors for an olfactory treat, and the whole thing would be nicely ventilated.

There would be various ways to wear the helmet, and the screen would go up and down. US Patent Office

The idea, definitely in a preliminary stage, is both horrifying and brilliant. Horrifying, because flying already stinks and the need to strap on a virtual reality helmet to make you forget just how hellish it is feels like a creepy add-on. Brilliant, because there’s no reason to expect economy class to become pleasant anytime soon, and the people packed into those thin, confining seats already look for ways to distract themselves. Thus, eye masks and noise-canceling headphones. Virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift promise great things. If people are getting excited about wearing headsets that let them play sweet games, why wouldn’t they want to use them while traveling?

Don’t expect the helmets anytime soon, though. This is merely a patent filing, and an Airbus rep says the company isn't doing anything to bring the idea to market; it's just protecting its IP. Beyond that, adding something like this would require navigating an American Ninja Warrior-level obstacle course of regulations governing absolutely everything about civil aviation. Then, airlines would have to want to buy them. Cost aside, the added weight (read: higher fuel bill) makes it a hard sell, especially since passengers can entertain themselves quite nicely with an iPad or, for the Luddites, a book.

If Airbus does bring this to market, it should include a setting to virtually transport yourself to first class.","It could lead to people becoming more isolated from each other. If people are able to strap on a virtual reality helmet and transport themselves to another world, they may be less likely to interact with the people around them.

196,ScopeAR Beams An Expert To You Through Augmented Reality,"Everyone needs an expert sometimes; a helping hand to point you in the right direction so you can get the job done.

Maybe you’re a mechanic working on an exotic car. You know everything there is to know about cars in general — but only a handful of people really know this car. Alas, they’re all on the other side of the planet.

Maybe you’re working on an oil rig, and one of the panels is throwing out errors. “REPLACE VALVE 6B”, reads the screen. You know how to replace a valve! You… just don’t know where said valve is. Your company has experts for this, but they’ve all been called off to other rigs.

Maybe you’re just at home trying to figure out which of the zillion poorly labeled ports on that shiny new A/V receiver is the one that can support a 4k resolution. All you need is someone to point out the right one, and you’re set.

ScopeAR, a company from YC’s Summer 2015 class, wants to help experts be anywhere they need to be via the magic of augmented reality.

The idea behind ScopeAR, over simplified: take a video call, and add the ability to draw on and annotate anything the person on the other end is looking at. As they move their camera, anything you’ve added — arrows, text, custom-made 3D models, etc. — stays locked onto the right place.

Need to know which valve is “Valve 6B”? Point your camera at that array of valves, and the expert can point right to it.

Rather than trying to supply a zillion experts themselves, ScopeAR is focusing on working with companies and teams who already have experts of their own. In many cases (like with the oil rig example above) companies will have specialized experts on hand, but said experts can’t be everywhere at once. Do they hire an expert for each rig, when the experts knowledge might only be needed once a month? Do they hire one expert and fly them around endlessly, wasting much of their time in commute? Or do they let the expert relax in one location, and beam them in via augmented reality when their knowhow is needed?

The concept works beyond oil rigs, of course. TrendyGadgetCo could use it to help customers figure out their purchases as if they’re looking right over the customer’s shoulder. Need help figuring out which HDMI port is which? Pop into the app, ring up one of TrendyGadgetCo’s experts, and have them point it out from a zillion miles away. They could say “Turn it off and back on again” while pointing at the power button.

Here’s what it looks like in action:

One thing the video doesn’t make quite clear: in its current form, ScopeAR requires a physical marker to act as its point of reference. The person dialing in the expert gets this marker — either printing it out themselves or getting it from their company beforehand — and sticks it on the gear they’re looking at. The company was previously experimenting with using Metaio’s AR framework for markerless tracking, but had to move away from it after Metaio was acquired by Apple and its products were shut down.

In its stead, ScopeAR currently uses Qualcomm’s Vuforia framework for tracking a marker, with a bespoke solution for transmitting the video/audio/annotation data back and forth between the caller and the expert.

ScopeAR is currently working with companies on a one-by-one basis. If your company works with field technicians and could use something like this, you can reach out to them right over here.","It could lead to a decrease in the quality of human interaction.

197,Only Robots Can Visit Deep-Sea Vents. Now You Can—In Glorious VR!,"The promise of virtual reality is that it can transport you to places you’d prefer not to go: the tops of the highest mountains, for instance, or the mosh pit of Norwegian party metal concert. Then there are the impossible places, like the roiling vents at the bottom of the deepest oceans, where crushing pressures and searing heat make an environment fit only for robots.

In March, one of those robots, the straightforwardly-named Remotely Operated Platform for Ocean Science, spent a staggering 150 hours exploring an undersea volcano near Samoa. Not only were researchers from the Schmidt Ocean Institute able to capture VR video and upload it to YouTube so regular folk can explore the action themselves (check it out below), but they 3-D mapped a so-called black smoker vent so scientists around the world can study the phenomenon independently.

But this wasn't all an exercise in delayed gratification. On the research vessel (named Falkor), the researchers used the ROV's mapping data to plan out their precious time---after all, operations can run tens of thousands of dollars a day, and the robot can only carry so much material back to the surface. “We sat down and decided, OK, we want to take only the most exciting, the most telling, the most important samples, which are laid out in front of us through this map,” says Tom Kwasnitschka, the expedition's chief scientist.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki8ly9gW3dM&feature=youtu.be

In the long term, the map will serve as a 3-D snapshot. Should the team return to the vent and map it again, they can see how the black smoker has morphed over time.

That's particularly important because scientists aren’t the only ones eyeballing these formations. Deep-sea mining outfits are itching to exploit black smokers, which are loaded with precious metals like copper, as well as the elusive rare earth metals that gadget manufacturers rely on. As water pours into the seafloor, underlying magma heats it up, infusing it with metals. That water pours out of the black smoker and accumulates as a precipitate. “This precipitate builds up pretty much the same way as if you chose not to clean your bathtub for three years,” says Kwasnitschka. And voila, a veritable factory for precious resources.

The thing is, these things are still largely mysterious, both geologically and ecologically. “The question is whether deep-sea hydrothermal systems should not be mined under any circumstances,” says Kwasnitschka. “Or whether, 'Oh you know, they die anyway, the animals die anyway, and others will open up and it's OK to mine them.' Nobody knows whether this is true or not.”

But as robots bring up more and more data from the depths, scientists will build a clearer picture of this most mysterious of ecosystems. For the rest of us, we can dive right into a VR underwater world. More enchanting than a Norwegian party metal concert, if you ask me.","The possibility of people becoming addicted to it.

198,"Virtual-Reality Porn is Coming, and Your Fantasies May Never Be the Same","After years of hype, VR is here. The Oculus Rift headsets arrive in early 2016. And when it does, porn undoubtedly will embrace it first, just as pioneered the adoption of the VCR and the CD-ROM and streaming video.

But unlike previous technologies, VR doesn’t operate within a frame: It erases it. VR’s promise of existing within the environment has particularly high-stakes problems and potential in pornography. If you feel vertigo when you peer out of an airplane in VR, imagine what that kind of physical response to porn could be. On the other hand, nobody wants to get kinky in the Uncanny Valley.

WIRED's Peter Rubin takes a look at what early VR—as guided by the inevitable power of the porn industry—will look like, and how it might introduce a dimension that's all too devoid from 2-D porn: intimacy.","The potential for users to experience vertigo or other physical reactions when viewing pornographic content. While this could potentially lead to some interesting and immersive experiences, it could also be quite dangerous if users are not careful.",https://www.wired.com/2015/12/virtual-reality-porn/,2015-12-21 20:11:04+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9946718811988832,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
199,LCD Hacking Trick Could Make Virtual Reality More Real,"Although competition among smartphone manufacturers has led to significant increases in the pixel density of commercial LCD panels in recent years, the displays on the market today don’t pack pixels densely enough for them to be invisible at very close range.

The Nvidia design exploits the fact that LCD panels use an array of tiny shutters that control the visibility of individual pixels. The researchers extracted the array of shutters from one LCD panel, and then placed them over those in another panel of the same design. The extra layer is positioned so that its pixels are just slightly offset from those of the panel below. The boundaries of the extra shutter layer divide up each pixel of the panel below into four smaller areas—these are the pixels of the new, cascaded display.

This design reduces the brightness of the display, because light has to pass through more components to reach the viewer. But this isn’t critical for a VR headset, where the display is close to the eye in a dark space.

Making use of that extra density requires some mathematical tricks, because when a shutter in the upper array changes its brightness, that affects four of the pixels visible to a person looking at the display. The Nvidia researchers have developed software that can translate the feed from a video or game into instructions for each layer to create the desired image for a viewer.

Cascaded displays can also offer an increased frame rate, which means moving images appear smoother. Setting the panels to refresh out of sync with one another causes someone using the display to see new frames at twice the rate each individual panel is updating.

Pixel density is far from the only factor that affects the quality of virtual reality experiences. Doug Bowman, a professor at Virginia Tech, says that his research suggests that having a wider field of view has perhaps the strongest effect on how immersed people feel in a virtual space, and how well they perform at tasks inside it.

One reason the Rift has been so well received is that it offers a wide field of view compared to previous headsets, at a relatively low cost. However, even the Rift’s 100-degree field of view imposes a kind of tunnel vision on people wearing it, because the human visual field is close to 180 degrees. Displays with greater pixel density could make it possible to cram more pixels into a headset so that when spread across a wide field of view by lenses—as in the design of Oculus Rift—they remain relatively densely packed.","The potential for addiction. People who use virtual reality headsets may become addicted to the immersive experiences they offer. This could lead to people spending more time in virtual reality than in the real world, which could have negative consequences for their social lives and mental health.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/07/28/171953/lcd-hacking-trick-could-make-virtual-reality-more-real/,2014-07-28 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9959523677825928,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,User Experience & Entertainment
200,Facebook’s Oculus Says Gaming Is Just One Thing You’ll Do in Virtual Reality,"Video games are an obvious application for virtual-reality headsets like the one Facebook’s Oculus division will launch early next year. But the chief technology officer of Oculus predicted Thursday that gaming will eventually account for less than half of the time people spend using the technology.

John Carmack, well known in the games industry for helping create the games Doom and Quake, described gaming as “the sharp end of the spear right now,” saying it will establish virtual reality as a technology consumers get excited about. But while many people love playing—and spending money on—games, much more time is spent watching videos and looking at photos.","It may eventually lead to people spending less time interacting with other people in the real world. This could have a number of negative consequences, including social isolation and less opportunities to build relationships and interact with others.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/09/24/166109/facebooks-oculus-says-gaming-is-just-one-thing-youll-do-in-virtual-reality/,2015-09-24 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.991862416267395,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
201,This Accessory Makes VR So Real a Surgeon Could Train with It,"Aler Gu, the young roboticist who invented the glove and cofounded the company behind it, Dextarobotics, says VR’s sensory expansion into the realm of touch has the power to revolutionize the medium. “The maximum level of feedback current VR controllers give is a gentle rumble using vibration motors,” he says. “But vibration alone isn’t enough to fool the brain. The moment you detect anomalies in how objects feel, your sense of immersion is broken.”

Dexmo’s applications reach far beyond video games, according to Gu. The glove can work in any simulated 3-D environment and is compatible with all of the major VR headsets currently on the market. He also believes that the device will be useful in CAD design, allowing engineers to disassemble rockets and feel the size of each component, or in medical training, where trainee surgeons can perform more realistic operations. It could prove invaluable in training bomb disposal experts and help drastically reduce costs in mechanical maintenance training by providing students with access to otherwise prohibitively expensive parts that they can feel in their hands.

Sam Watts, head of operations at Make Real, a software company that has worked on a variety of VR applications for military clients as well as consumer game publishers, agrees that the current crop of motion-tracked controllers that are sold alongside the major virtual reality headsets “only give the first stage of sensations of touching and interacting with virtual objects.”

The Dexmo glove has potential applications well beyond gaming.

The HTC Vive Wands, for example, are held snugly in the hands, like handgun grips. A digital representation of the controller is seen at all times within the virtual world, twisting and moving in perfect sync with your hand motions. “This is fine for games and many forms of training simulation, but for real industrial and engineering adoption of VR, much more realistic and precise feedback is required to accurately convey the sense of touching, using, and manipulating objects together.”

However, Watts says, he needs to see more testing and evidence of consumer adoption of the device before including support for the Dexmo in Make Real’s products.

While the price of a consumer version of the Dexmo is yet to be set, Gu is optimistic that the glove will be something that “eventually everybody should be able to afford.” For now, however, the Dexmo is a tool restricted to the hands of early adopting software developers like Watts, those who will ultimately decide what impact such devices will have on both sides of the screen.","It has the potential to replace real-world experiences. For example, if engineers are able to use VR to design rockets, they may never have to build a physical model. This could lead to a decrease in the need for physical testing, which could have a negative impact on safety. Additionally, if VR is used to train surgeons, they may never have to operate on a real patient. This could lead to a decrease in the quality of care for patients.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/09/30/70059/this-accessory-makes-vr-so-real-a-surgeon-could-train-with-it/,2016-09-30 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9944624304771424,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
202,A Simple Trick to Avoid Losing Your Lunch While in Virtual Reality,"In a series of tests, 30 volunteers used the VR system to explore a digital landscape—using the dynamically blinkered system one day then an unrestricted system the next. When the participants used the system with view restrictions, they stayed in the VR environment for longer and scored the experience as being more comfortable.

Two different versions of the device were also tested, one with a more subtle narrowing effect than the other. The majority of people didn’t notice the less extreme of the two versions, and those who did unanimously claimed to prefer it to the unrestricted VR system.

It’s not the first attempt to try to alleviate the effects of motion sickness in VR. A team from the Mayo Clinic has been repurposing a technique that’s currently used to help military pilots avoid nausea. But while effective, that approach uses electrodes to stimulate the body, fooling its sense of balance into sensing motion where none exists.

By comparison, then, the new system seems like a simple yet effective means of controlling nausea among VR users.

203,Oculus Rift Hack Transfers Your Facial Expressions onto Your Avatar,"That could make inhabiting and interacting in virtual worlds more compelling, says Hao Li, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California who led the project. “To get a virtual social environment, you want to convey this behavior to other people,” he says. “This is the first facial tracking that has been demonstrated through a head-mounted display.” Li was named one of MIT Technology Review’s Young Innovators in 2013.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he’s interested in the Oculus Rift headset providing new ways to socialize, although he hasn’t divulged any details. The social network acquired Oculus last year (see “What Zuckerberg Sees in Oculus Rift”).

Li says that the Oculus researchers worked with him purely as a research exercise, but that it wouldn’t be too difficult to polish the system they came up with and make it a commercial product. “If people think this is really central to important killer applications, you could get it into production relatively quickly,” he says.

“This is really cool,” says Philip Rosedale, who previously founded Second Life and is now CEO of a virtual worlds startup called High Fidelity. The company is working on enabling realistic virtual social interaction by using webcams and other sensor technology to track facial expressions and arm and hand gestures (see “The Quest to Put More Reality in Virtual Reality”).

There’s good evidence that making people’s avatars display their real-world body language helps them connect to other people in a virtual world, says Rosedale. He agrees with Li that it should be possible to streamline the first proof of concept. The camera could be integrated into the underside of the headset, for example. Efforts by researchers and startups to put eye-tracking cameras inside virtual reality headsets might offer an alternative way to gather data on the upper part of the face.

The linchpin of Li’s system is software that can combine data from the sensors tracking the upper and lower parts of the face and match the result onto a 3-D model of a face.

For now, that software requires you to go through a brief calibration process the first time you use the system. First you give your face muscles a 10-second workout by contorting them into a few different expressions while wearing a headset with the display part removed in front of a 3-D camera, so it can get a full view of the face. Then you don the complete headset and give your face a workout for another 10 seconds. The data collected helps the software figure out how to correctly match the streams of data from your upper and lower face.

Li says he’s working to eliminate that step by feeding his software more data on different faces. He is also working on other techniques that could make it easier to copy your real self into a virtual world. Many tools have already been developed to create 3-D replicas of people’s bodies and faces using conventional and 3-D cameras. Li recently made a system that tackles the more challenging task of making a realistic 3-D re-creation of a person’s hairstyle. His software can do it using only a single photo. That project and the face-tracking research will both be presented at the Siggraph computer graphics conference in Los Angeles this August.","The development of virtual reality technology has led to a number of unintended consequences, one of which is the potential for people to become disconnected from reality. As people spend more time in virtual worlds, they may find it increasingly difficult to connect with people in the real world.

204,Like Entropy? You'll Love Watching This PlayStation VR Teardown Video,"Sony's PSVR system goes on sale Thursday, completing the consumer virtual-reality triad of 2016. Of course, where the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive draw on the processing power of a high-end PC, the PSVR runs on Sony's PlayStation 4---more than 40 million of which have sold since the game console's launch three years ago. That's a big pool of purchase potential, and while a PS4 can't provide the same high-octane boost as a high-end desktop computer, the PSVR's $399 price might be enough to make people overlook the incremental performance hit.

But what exactly lurks within PSVR's futuristic form factor? In this video, we see Sony Interactive Entertainment mechanical design director Takamasa Araki disassemble the VR headset screw by screw, laying its innards bare. There's not much detail about the system's specs---the 5.7-inch OLED display, say, or the Sixaxis motion sensors embedded in the headset that help a Playstation Camera track it in space---or the external processor unit that helps mirror your VR experience on the TV (or allows non-VR players to play alongside the PSVR wearer).

205,VR Will Make Life Better—Or Just Be an Opiate for the Masses,"Virtual reality will dramatically transform movies and gaming, but some see an even loftier goal for the burgeoning technology: Providing the world’s poor and underprivileged with a better life. Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus Rift, and his chief technology officer, John Carmack, even speak of a ""moral imperative"" to bring virtual reality to the masses.

“Everyone wants to have a happy life,” as Luckey likes to say, “but it's going to be impossible to give everyone everything they want.” But VR can provide billions of people with virtual versions of everything the wealthy take for granted: touring the Louvre, sailing the sun-dappled coast of California, or simply sitting in a meadow beneath a clear blue sky free of smog and pollution. “Virtual reality can make it so anyone, anywhere can have these experiences,” Luckey says.

Carmack, a pioneer in 3-D graphics, has championed this mission for some two decades, but only recently has the underlying technology reached a price point where VR headsets can cost as little as a cheap smartphone. And that, he says, makes it possible for virtual reality to improve the real lives of people worldwide, even the less fortunate.

""These are devices that you could imagine almost everyone in the world owning,” Carmack says. “This means that some fraction of the desirable experiences of the wealthy can be synthesized and replicated for a much broader range of people.”

The Experience Machine

This assumes, of course, that people are willing to strap into VR devices and not perceive any meaningful difference between what’s real and what only seems to be. Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick explored this very question more than 30 years ago in an influential thought experiment. ""Suppose,” he wrote in 1974, “there were an experience machine that would give you any experience you desired. Super-duper neurophysicists could stimulate your brain so that you would think and feel you were writing a great novel, or making a friend, or reading an interesting book. All the time you would be floating in a tank, with electrodes attached to your brain. Would you plug in?""

It seemed obvious to Nozick, who died in 2002, that people would not. ""We learn that something matters to us in addition to experience, by imagining an experience machine and then realizing that we would not use it,"" he wrote. But some of the world’s most powerful companies---Facebook, Sony, and Google among them---are investing billions to mass-produce what are effectively experience machines, utterly convinced that we’re all eager to plug in.

Luckey, for one, “absolutely” would plug in. “If you asked anyone in the virtual reality industry, they would say the same,” he says.

The Pull of the Virtual

There’s compelling evidence to suggest Luckey is not alone. I recently lived for some months in the teeming, smog-shrouded city of Beijing and vividly remember noticing how many people were engrossed in 3-D fantasy games, playing them in cavernous Internet gaming cafés or on smartphones in suffocating subways and congested malls. Such games are tremendously popular in China, where hundreds of millions while away their waking hours fixated on the virtual worlds like Fantasy Westward Journey or World of Warcraft. This seems to undermine Nozick’s answer to the experience machine challenge, while reinforcing what many in the VR industry fiercely believe. “There is no difference between a life lived in virtual reality versus 'real reality,'"" says Philip Rosedale.

Rosedale was the co-creator of the popular online world Second Life, and he’s currently building High Fidelity. Both attempt to create something like the Metaverse from Neal Stephenson’s seminal novel Snowcrash---a vast, virtual world accessed by millions of people through VR headsets. (Luckey has announced his own long-term goal of building a metaverse.)","One unintended consequence of virtual reality is that it could lead to people becoming more isolated from each other.

206,One Man’s Search for the DNA Data That Could Save His Life,"When Bryce Olson tells his prostate cancer story, he pinpoints the conversation he had with his oncologist six years ago as the moment his life changed. That’s when Olson, then 44, his body pumping with adrenaline and his hip throbbing with new pain from a metastasized tumor, uttered these words: “I want to get my cancer sequenced.”

Wearing a slickly designed black T-shirt with the words “Sequence Me” in block heavy-metal-style lettering, Olson preaches to audiences at health care conferences that they should take back control of their health from paternalistic providers and demand better cancer care. On his website, he offers patients a “battle card” with scripted comebacks to doctors’ resistance.

And if your doctor refuses to order genetic testing? “Well, then you need a new doctor!” he exclaims to often enthusiastic applause.

But in 2014, his own doctor at the Oregon Health & Science University medical center in Portland, after hearing Olson’s request, had merely asked, “Why?” It didn’t make sense, the doctor had said, especially if it turned out there were no drugs available for the DNA mutations the sequencing technology would find.

Despite the handful of so-called targeted cancer therapies that were matched to patients’ genetic makeup, there wasn’t one for prostate cancer that had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Olson was already aware of that fact. The conversation was life-changing, because it marked the moment he was done with the American medical system—or at least what’s known as “standard of care” for cancer patients.

By that time, Olson had already undergone surgery to remove his prostate gland and seminal vesicles. Soon after, he learned the cancer had spread to his bones—creating lesions the size of quarters—and was incurable. That was the news that made him sob hysterically inside his car in the hospital parking garage while blaring the radio and repeatedly screaming “Fuck!” He’d researched the statistic that the median five-year survival rate for Stage 4 prostate cancer patients was 28 percent.

Olson also had just finished six months of chemotherapy. Despite hearing about a “golden age” of cancer treatment, he was prescribed the drug docetaxel, which had been patented in 1986 and was routinely given to patients with breast, lung, prostate, stomach, and head and neck cancers. The treatment, sold under the brand name Taxotere, was so toxic it had earned the name “Taxo-Terrible,” because of its dreaded side effects. Olson got them all: zero energy, hair loss, bone pain, mouth sores, constipation, and a numb sensation in his feet that felt like needles were poking him and made it hard to keep his balance.

The mother of his 6-year-old daughter’s best friend had been so worried about him she asked the school district to move up the annual father-daughter dance from spring to fall to make sure he could attend. During those months, he’d tried to spend as much time with his kid as possible.

At home, he’d play guitar while she drew, or he streamed his favorite ’80s movies, such as Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. Even though she was too young to understand the references, he wanted to make sure she didn’t miss out on what he considered an important part of his childhood. He also gave her pep talks about avoiding drugs and only dating boys who treated her right—in case he didn’t get another chance later.","It may make it harder for people to empathize with others.

207,Trying On Russia's AR Moto Helmet With Fighter-Jet Specs,"Andrew Artishchev has the overtly persistent personality you'd expect of a young entrepreneur from Russia. The CEO of LiveMap and his usability expert, Dmitry Sizonov, are in the midst of a West Coast tour showing off the first prototype of the start-up's augmented reality motorcycle helmet. It's an awesome idea, but so far, it's been rough going.

""You can't raise venture money in Russia,"" Artishchev tells WIRED as Sizonov sets up an intricate array of electronics, wires, and mounts. ""Russia is like the U.S. They only want to invest in software, not hardware.""

That's a common cry from ambitious entrepreneurs around the world, and it's one reason crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter have come to prominence. Too bad Kickstarter didn't want anything to do with LiveMap.

""We were on Kickstarter for two weeks and were pulled off,"" Artishchev says. ""I contacted every person [at Kickstarter] and got no response."" The reason for the radio silence, Artishchev would later discover, is that safety products bring a host of liability concerns, and Kickstarter wouldn't shoulder the risk. A few days later, LiveMap debuted on competing crowdfunding site Indiegogo, and the helmet started getting attention. Lots of it.

The helmet combines elements of Google Glass with the kind of head-up display you'd find on a fighter-jet. ""It's better than an F35 helmet at $100,000,"" Artishchev claims. ""But ours only costs $2,000.""

That's a big statement from a small company, and based on the prototype assembled on the conference room table, they've got a long way to go.

In its current form, the company only has a 3-D-printed helmet that's been polished and painted. It's just a mock-up -- a Daft Punk prop -- without electronics, padding, or even a transparent visor. The real technology is a tangle of taped together cords, a custom printed circuit board, and a laser pico projector displaying full color, high-resolution images on a piece of plexiglass dangling from a mount.

It's powered by two 3,000 milliamp batteries -- Google Glass barely gets by with a 570 mAh pack -- and links up with 4G LTE. Despite that energy intensive data connection, GPS, and what Artishchev promises will be a ""4K resolution"" video camera, they claim the LiveMap helmet will run for 10 hours.

Voice controls will be handled by Nuance's voice-to-text technology -- the same company handling Apple's Siri system -- with data pulled from Yelp to provide restaurant and service recommendations, while maps are sourced from Navteq.

Naturally, this cobbled together prototype is rough, but the underlying technology works. Maps are clear, with simulated turn-by-turn directions showing well even in a brightly lit office. The voice searches pull up the best place for seafood when asked, ""Where can I get a fish dinner?"" And Artishchev says offline maps will be available when riders don't have a data connection.

But despite lots of press and even interest from some police departments in their home country, LiveMap only has five backers that have pledged $1,500 to get one of the first helmets. And deliveries aren't expected for another year, assuming LiveMap meets the stringent safety requirements in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.

That's one reason why a partnership with a major helmet manufacturer would almost be a necessity, particularly if LiveMap wants to market its helmet with a $2,000 sticker. ""It's like a high-end camera,"" Artishchev says before confirming, ""we are working with a famous helmet company."" They'll need the help and the resources. It's a great concept desperately in need of a polished execution that only a company like Arai or Bell could pull off.

208,Can VR Survive in a Cutthroat Attention Economy?,"Last decade, the technology was questionable; this decade, the content. But today the greatest challenge for VR—as both an industry and medium—is no longer the tech or the content but the problem of time and attention. How, exactly, will or does VR fit into the collective human schedule? When and where will large numbers of people “do” VR, in a time when nearly every second of week is contested territory?

Today, I think only the deeply jaded would deny that VR has the goods, or is at least pretty close. The goggles could get better, but they work. Every year the creators of VR films and games produce a handful of stunning, memorable pieces (even if they haven’t always quite figured out the stubborn tension between narrative and interaction). Sundance is an important annual showcase—last year’s Asteroids, Miyubi and Chocolate were unforgettable—and this year brought new wonders like Spheres and Wolves in the Walls, among others. Sure, there could be more of it, and not all VR content is great, but something as simple as a VR tour of the Obama White House can be a memorable, affecting trip. But when or where will people actually spend the time to see this stuff? That’s the hard question, and one that has really burned VR over the last few years. Media history makes it clear that a commercial medium can only survive if it finds itself a reliable, repeatable place in the national schedule for significant numbers of people. (Those that don’t, like the 90s Web-TV efforts Pseudo.com and MSN 2.0, simply die after burning through lots of money).

Looking back, every successful medium has either “killed” a predecessor (in the manner that television displaced radio in the home, or that streaming video is chipping away at cable) or “colonized” time and attention that was unused or used for something else. However, that was somewhat easier when people actually had free time. Today, we live in a media environment where billions of dollars are spent fighting for the time spent “waiting at the bus stop.""

Making matters even more challenging: unlike other newish forms of media, VR demands not just passing attention but the absolutely highest quality of devotion. Other media can target brains that are doing something else as well. That helps explain the success of podcasting, which has plundered the driving hours, or social media, which thrives on what Jonah Peretti of Buzzfeed memorably called the “Bored at Work Network"". Yet no one waiting for a bus pulls out VR goggles (at least not yet), and you still can’t turn to VR if you get bored at a meeting. Meanwhile, VR units face incredibly tough competition inside what we call our homes but are really more like media studios, festooned as they are with television, videogame consoles, computers, and phones, not to mention old-school interactive units like roommates or family.

All this points to an unexpected near-term future for VR. It wasn’t unreasonable to bet that VR would take over home prime-time hours, but that hasn’t worked out as planned—television and traditional gaming are just too tough as competitors. But the time that is open is the time people spend outside of the home, looking for something to do, alone or with friends. As Pete Billington, director of the critically acclaimed Wolves in the Walls, points out, good VR film experiences really aren’t that dissimilar from live, immersive theatre productions like Sleep No More or, especially, Then She Fell, both of which attract giant lines in New York City.

The solution, then, would be to focus on scaling up immersive theatre to the masses (perhaps focusing on character-driven VR, as Edward Saatchi, a co-founder of Oculus Story Studios, argues). It is the colonization of whatever time people might otherwise spend outside the home, one way or another—at theaters, movies, museums, art galleries, or even just bars—that holds the most promise for VR.","The unintended consequence of virtual reality is that it creates a barrier between the user and the outside world.

As documented in this TV ad from the mid-'90s (see video above), the Virtual Boy was the Oculus Rift of its day. Released by Japanese game giant Nintendo in 1995, it promised to provide a virtual reality unlike anything that came before.

Sadly, it was a giant flop. And you could kinda tell it would be from the ad's brief glimpse of Mario Tennis, Virtual Boy's signature game. No, it couldn't be viewed on conventional TV. But that doesn't mean it looked good on Virtual Boy.

Virtual Boy's graphics evoked old-fashioned 3-D movies---the kind you'd wear to red and blue glasses to watch---and Nintendo never really figured out how to take advantage of even this rudimentary VR. At a time when the Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn game consoles were already on the market and the Nintendo 64 was right around the corner, the Virtual Boy's monochromatic graphics seemed downright retro. It just couldn't compete with new first person shooters like Doom and Heretic.

""On some level, there seemed to be a belief that this was the inevitable endpoint of videogame progress---a 3-D world that you experienced through a head-mounted visor,"" WIRED wrote in 2010 for the the console's 15th anniversary. ""Virtual Boy didn’t actually do that, but it sure looked the part.""

It did---and it has its own particular charm. Much like the doomed Power Glove and Power Pad helped pave the way for the Nintendo Wii, the Virtual Boy helped pave the way for the more successful Nintendo 3DS handheld. And with companies ranging from Sony to open sourcers like AntVR building new virtual reality headsets, this kind of thing may become actual reality. But it won't play Mario Tennis.

210,The VR illusion that makes you think you have a spider’s body,"Today we get a partial answer thanks to the work of Andrey Krekhov and colleagues at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. These guys have compared the way humans take on ownership of human versus nonhuman bodies such as those of tigers, bats, and spiders.

They say that in certain situations, the experience of owning a nonhumanoid body is more convincing than that of owning a humanoid body. And this result paves the way for virtual body ownership to play a greater role in applications such as training, education, and of course video-gaming, where the potential is significant.

First some background. The rubber hand illusion begins by covering a person’s real hand and placing a rubber hand next to it. The subject can see the rubber hand but not their real hand. The illusionist then lightly touches or strokes both hands in the same place and in the same way.

The subject, seeing the rubber hand being stroked, feels the sensation as if it were their real hand, which is also being stroked but in a way they cannot see. In that instant, the illusion is created: the subject feels that the rubber hand is part of their own body. Many people find this a surprising and dramatic sensation.

The illusion was first described in the 1990s, but since then researchers have gone much further. The next generation of experiments used early forms of virtual reality. The subject wears a VR headset and looks down at their body to find it is that of a gorilla, for example.

While the subject watches, the virtual body receives a poke in the chest. But at the same instant, the the subject’s real body is poked in the same place. In that instant, the illusion is created: the subject feels ownership of the virtual body.

The limitations of this technique were immediately clear. The illusion requires visual and tactile stimuli simultaneously. That’s straightforward for a rubber hand but becomes more difficult for an entire body, particularly when the virtual limbs start moving in a way that the subject’s real body does not match.

That seemed to limit the application of the illusion until a breakthrough in 2010. At that time, researchers discovered how to trigger the body ownership illusion using visual cues alone. They did this by tracking the subject’s body movements in microfine detail, the level of hand and finger movements. They then reproduced these movements exactly in the virtual body.

This immediately makes the illusion easier to achieve. And this is what Krekhov and co study for a wider range of body ownership models. Their work focuses on three types of virtual bodies—a four-legged animal in the form of a tiger, a flying animal in the form of a bat, and a creature with an entirely different exoskeleton in the form of a spider.

Their goal is to explore the limits of body ownership with challenging examples that differ from human bodies in posture, shape, and even entire skeleton. Their goal is to understand how well the human brain copes with the body ownership illusion in these cases, and whether it is possible at all in the most extreme cases.

Their method was straightforward. They subjected 37 volunteers to the illusion, measuring how they coped and asking them to rate their experiences compared with humanoid body ownership. In each case, they mapped the participant’s body movements precisely to the movements of the virtual body to trigger the illusion.

The results make for interesting reading. Krekhov and co say that humans are surprisingly good at adopting alien forms. “Our experiment shows that even spiders, despite having a skeleton that significantly differs from ours, offer a similar degree of the illusion of virtual body ownership compared to humanoid avatars,” they say.

What’s more, some body types are better than humanoid ones in certain circumstances. For example, bat bodies are better at reproducing the sensation of flying than humanoid bodies. “Our empirical results demonstrate that virtual body ownership is also applicable for nonhumanoids and can even outperform human-like avatars in certain cases,” they say.

The technique is clearly popular with the participants. The researchers asked them what other body types they’d like to try, with suggestions ranging from cats and dogs to sea animals such as whales and dolphins. But there was a clear winner in this respect. “We suppose that flying creatures have the largest potential to fascinate users as embodiment targets in VR,” say Krekhov and co.

That’s interesting work that has the potential for significant applications. The most obvious is in the gaming world, where the illusion of owning another character’s body has obvious charms. But there are also educational and training applications, plus the inevitable applications in the world of pornography.

Of course, there are limitations to overcome before this kind of illusion can become widespread. Virtual-reality kits are becoming increasingly common, but this technology has to be coupled with accurate body tracking equipment. That will be an enabling step. A broader challenge will be to overcome the problems with VR, which often leaves users feeling nauseated.

Nevertheless, the startling fact is that virtual body ownership is both easier than ever and possible with a wider variety of bodies than anyone imagined. Expect to hear more about it.

211,Inhabit This Teddy Bear’s Body Using Virtual Reality,"Adaniya thinks children and some adults will be interested in taking on the persona of a stuffed animal—such as a bear, cat, or dog—for fun, or as an unusual way to stay in touch with distant friends or relatives. His company, Adawarp, just went through a startup incubator focused on virtual reality companies called River, which invests at least $200,000 in each company in its program. Adaniya’s project began after he broke up with a long-distance girlfriend and thought about what could have helped them communicate.

I tried out Adaniya’s creation in a tiny conference room. When I pulled on the Rift headset I was transported across the table into the body of the bear. Fluffed-out fur rimmed the edge of my vision as I peeked out at Adaniya and, to his left, my own body.

The uncanny sense of being outside myself subsided surprisingly soon. My former body now felt like just a passive observer in the room. Being able to turn my robotic head helped give the feel of a normal conversation by making it possible to maintain a semblance of eye contact. Adaniya helped by focusing his attention on the bear.

Cameras in the bear’s eyes are used to feed stereo imagery to a person wearing a virtual reality headset.

“The impression of the word ‘robot’ is scary and big,” Adaniya told me. “I don’t want to feel like this is a robot. I want to feel this is an animal, or a new spirit.” My joystick-controlled arms looked a little bit robotic, but Adawarp plans to eventually capture arm movement directly with a motion-sensor.

By the end of 2016, Adaniya aims to ship a version of his robot with a plain plastic body priced at $200 or less. That version will be aimed at encouraging hardware developers to build their own bodies for it. He is also working on making it possible to control the robot without a virtual reality headset, by panning a mobile phone around. The consumer version will come after and bring back the fur. Adaniya thinks versions that look like cats, dogs, and bears could all be popular.

Cindy Bethel, director of the Social, Therapeutic and Robotic Systems Laboratory at Mississippi State University, says that Adaniya’s idea has some potential but will also face challenges. Children are likely to prefer seeing the face of a parent via video chat to interacting with them in bear form, she says. But the ability to touch or hug a tangible figure could be beneficial, says Bethel.

Having a person take the form of a robot might be a boon in situations where a child needs to talk with an unfamiliar adult, such as a therapist or tutor, says Bethel. A small, cuddly bear could feel less threatening and be easier to open up to than a stranger.

However, Bethel also notes that having a robot take on the role of a person risks the effect known as “uncanny valley,” where an artificial creation tries and fails to be human-like, creating a sense of revulsion instead. “If for some reason it doesn’t move naturally, that could be kind of creepy to people,” she says.","The potential for the technology to create a sense of revulsion in users.

212,Virtual Reality Is the Rich White Kid of Technology,"It has been seven years since Palmer Luckey appeared on the cover of WIRED magazine. The June 2014 issue declared, “This kid is about to change gaming, movies, TV, music, design, medicine, sex, sports, art, travel, social network, education—and reality.” This was just after Facebook acquired his virtual reality company, Oculus, for $2 billion. It now invests $18.5 billion annually into research and development, and Facebook Reality Labs, the company’s Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality division, accounts for as much as 20 percent of its entire workforce, with no sign of slowing down. But despite the many years, billions of dollars, and year-long pandemic requiring at-home entertainment, the results thus far have been pretty lackluster. The headsets are spiffier and the games are more lucrative, but our minds nevertheless remain collectively un-blown.

It’s not just Facebook and Oculus. In May 2016, WIRED’s cover story introduced readers to Magic Leap, “A mysterious startup, a mountain of money, and the quest to create a new kind of reality.” Magic Leap was developing a set of semitransparent “Mixed Reality” goggles that could integrate virtual objects into the user’s physical environment. The company raised more than $2 billion in funding from A-list Silicon Valley investors. It looked like the biggest leap forward in hardware since the iPhone. But the actual product never lived up to the breathtaking demo. The company laid off 1,000 employees in 2020, hired a new CEO, and pivoted to focus on narrower enterprise applications. The Mixed Reality future is still, well, the future.

Somehow, none of these less-than-ideal outcomes have affected confidence in VR. In fact, Facebook doubled down on Monday, announcing a new group within the company dedicated to developing its Horizons VR world. Mark Zuckerberg recently told Facebook employees that over the next five years he expects to transition “from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company.” Silicon Valley billionaires and venture capitalists, it seems, are incapable of saying no to a fancy headset with a big dream. And this dates back 35 years—Jaron Lanier was the Palmer Luckey of the 1980s and early 1990s!

The technology is always about to turn a corner, about to be more than just a gaming device, about to revolutionize fields like architecture, defense, and medicine. The future of work, entertainment, travel, and society is always on the verge of a huge virtual upgrade. VR is a bit like a rich white kid with famous parents: It never stops failing upward, forever graded on a generous curve, always judged based on its “potential” rather than its results.

One reason that VR has been offered such an endless string of second chances (VR’s proverbial lineage, if you will) is that it has played an outsized role in the popular science fiction that our collective image of the future is built around. William Gibson coined the term “cyberspace” in his 1984 book Neuromancer. The term later became synonymous with the World Wide Web, but Gibson’s initial rendering was of a virtual realm that “console cowboys” could enter and exit. Gibson and his cyberpunk peers heavily shaped the culture of 1980s tech—before the dotcom boom, before the tech bros.

When Lanier unveiled his bulky head-mounted display and dataglove in 1987, he was inviting tech hobbyists to be the first inhabitants of the virtual future they had glimpsed in cyberpunk novels. Neal Stephenson’s 1992 Snow Crash and Ernest Cline’s 2011 Ready Player One later were massive science fiction hits whose stories unfolded in a future where VR is a fixture.

When Zuckerberg says that he has been “thinking about some of this stuff since [he] was in middle school and just starting to code,” it isn’t hard to guess what books he was reading at the time. For the Gen X and Millennial tech entrepreneurs who dominate Silicon Valley today, the science fiction stories of their youth have always treated VR as an ambient part of the future technological landscape.

Just as the current billionaire space race is, at least in part, evidence that inside every tech billionaire is an inner child who dreamed of flying his own rocket ship, the VR arms race is premised on an assumption that mass adoption is inevitable—the only question is when that future will arrive, and which company will get phenomenally wealthy when it does.","It may create a sense of isolation in users.

213,Facebook's Bizarre VR App Is Exactly Why Zuck Bought Oculus,"""Where do you want to hang out?"" Max asked me. ""Do you like pandas?"" Do I like pandas? This is like asking if someone likes tacos, or sunshine, or the sound a puppy makes when it curls up on your lap. I looked at him a little more closely to see if he was joking, but he just stood there, smiling a cartoon smile through his cartoon beard. ""Let's go see some pandas!"" I said.

""Great!"" Max held out his cartoon hand. Down the hall, the real Max—an employee at Facebook—was holding an Oculus Touch controller, but here in virtual reality his hand contained what looked like a glass sphere. He placed it on the table in front of us, and it immediately expanded outward, rushing past us, until we stood within it. ""Look behind you,"" he said; when I saw the panda standing on a wooden platform, I couldn't help but laugh. The sphere we'd been pulled into was a 360-degree video of a Chinese nature reserve.

So much for FarmVille.

When Facebook bought Oculus in 2014, the obvious question—besides ""Seriously? Two billion dollars?""—was what Facebook was planning to do with a virtual reality company. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that VR would be ""the most social platform ever,"" but what would that mean? People joked about giant newsfeeds towering over your head in VR, or Facebook ads popping up in the middle of a videogame you were playing. No one joked about pandas. But that was before Facebook Spaces. The VR app, which I tried last week at Facebook's campus and is now available in beta, does much more than just let Facebook friends hang out in VR. By leveraging Facebook's ubiquity in day-to-day life, Spaces promises to make virtual reality more personal, and more relatable, than it's ever been.

Facebook

Social VR—With Actual Friends

Virtual reality has made huge strides over the past five years, but for something that so invites interaction with other people, it's still a starkly individual experience. If you want to experience VR with a friend, you can invite them over to use your headset, or you can…well, that's really it. (Mobile headsets are more portable, but they also notably lack crucial ingredients of ""presence,"" the sensation of physically being inside a virtual space.) Even then, you're stuck watching them have fun, or they you; you can't both be in VR at the same time, unless you have multiple computer/headset setups. The only way to be in VR with other people is via a multiplayer experience.

Dedicated social VR apps have been popping up for a few years to address that issue. However, they all work on the same principle: either you convince your one friend who has a headset to log in at the same time, or you hang out in VR with strangers—an endeavor which, in these early-adopter days, can feel like firing up Tinder in the Mos Eisley cantina. Chat-room anonymity is a hallowed internet tradition, but when you're sitting around a VR campfire, surrounded by avatars that may or may not look anything like their owners' IRL selves (and as a rule you can bet on ""not""), it can also be unsettling.

When you launch Spaces from within your Oculus Rift headset, though, it logs into your Facebook account. The same one that you, along with nearly 2 billion other people on the planet, use on a regular basis. The same one you've already populated with all the information that Spaces now can serve back to you—like, for instance, a selection of your photos that you can use to create an avatar.

Or all your other Facebook friends who have a Rift and Oculus Touch controllers. Or any 360-degree content in your timeline that you can now launch around yourself. Or even just your regular old 2-D photos that you can flip through in the solitude of your own private Idaho. Like, literally, your own private Idaho. (Assuming you have a 360-degree photo of Idaho.)

Virtual Dinner Parties for Everyone

Admittedly, there's not a whole lot to do in Spaces once you're hanging out. There's a marker you can use to draw interactive 3-D objects, like sketching a hat, and then putting it on your friend's head. This being the internet, there's a mirror in which you can gaze upon your majestic cartoon countenance. (Don't act like you wouldn't do it.) There's also a selfie stick, which you can use to take a VR photo of yourself and your friends, and then post that photo to your real-life Facebook feed.

That limited palette of options is a far cry from those of other social VR apps that have built platforms around shared activities like disc golf and Dungeons & Dragons. It's also intentional. Facebook places a premium not on what you're doing, but who you're doing it with. Rachel Rubin Franklin, who heads up the company's social VR efforts, likens Spaces to a dinner party rather than an infinite wonderland. ""These are your Facebook friends,"" she says. ""That changes what you do in Spaces significantly, because you've already established a relationship."" In the future, she can imagine Spaces expanding its toolset, and even allowing for connections among people who aren't Facebook friends, but for now she and her team want to see how people use it.

Virtual reality is no longer an alienating abstraction.

Before Franklin came to Facebook last October, the social VR group had already been exploring various activities: tower-defense board games; music-creation games; even the ability to design a dollhouse and then teleport into it. But the more people had to do, the team found, the more they concentrated on the activity—and the less they concentrated on each other. The group formulated a litmus test for what Spaces would include: Does it facilitate social interaction? Is it going to make my relationship with you stronger, better, more memorable? ""If that's not happening,"" Franklin says, ""then it doesn't belong in here. At least not now.""

The Cool World Effect

There's one more thing Spaces does, and it's an important one. Mark Zuckerberg hinted at it last fall at developer conference Oculus Connect, when he and members of Facebook's social VR team demonstrated what we now know was an early build of Spaces. During that demo, Zuckerberg was in VR, hanging out in a 360 video of his own house, then took a Messenger video call from his wife, Priscilla. She wasn't in VR, though; instead, he saw her face on a popup screen within VR, and she saw his avatar on her own phone. At the time it felt like a scene out of Who Framed Roger Rabbit or Cool World: cartoon characters and flesh-and-blood humans co-existing in violation of all laws of physics and fiction. Now, those video Messenger calls are part of the Spaces beta, and the boundary that cordons off VR from the rest of reality has officially collapsed.

With that functionality, along with the whole selfie-stick thing, VR is no longer an alienating abstraction. It's not that thing someone else is doing when they have a headset on; now it's that thing you've seen them doing. Now it's where they took that selfie in front of the Eiffel Tower, flashing a thumbs up, despite not having a passport. Now it's where they are when you pick up the video Messenger call on your phone and see their cartoonish avatar peeking out at you from the bottom of the ocean. Or the International Space Station. Or a panda habitat. You're not there with them—and whether they're there is a question we still can't quite answer—but you're sharing that experience with them. And that's exactly what Mark Zuckerberg wanted in the first place.","Although Facebook's Spaces app is intended to make virtual reality more personal and relatable, one of the unintended consequences is that it could further alienate people who don't have access to VR technology. For example, if people are constantly sharing photos and videos of their VR experiences with friends, those friends who don't have VR headsets may feel left out and excluded. Additionally, the app's reliance on Facebook's ubiquity could also backfire, as people who don't use Facebook (or who don't want to connect their Facebook account to their VR headset) may be less likely to use Spaces.",https://www.wired.com/2017/04/facebook-spaces-vr-for-your-friends/,2017-04-18 17:41:49+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9955737590789796,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
214,What Virtual Reality for Flies Teaches Us About Human Vision,"As an expert in the science of visual perception, Damon Clark is always thinking about how animal brains process and repackage the information from their environment in order to make it as useful as possible. Recently, he’s been trying to unravel these processes using fruit flies, styrofoam balls, and an optical illusion—all part of an experiment to see if tricking flies into perceiving motion can offer valuable clues about how human vision works.

“There’s nothing inherently weird about illusions, I would say, because nothing we perceive is real,” says Clark, associate professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology at Yale University. He’s not espousing new-age theology or brain-in-a-vat philosophy: Clark knows well, from his years of studying the visual system, just how different our perceptions can be from what’s actually in front of us. Consider, for example, how frequently most people see faces in wood grain, or burnt toast, or a popcorn ceiling. There’s nothing special about those surfaces, but the human brain evolved to recognize faces far more quickly and readily than other objects. After all, a brain that incorrectly assumes that the grill of that car is a face is also a brain that can readily and rapidly detect people—who may be friends or foes—in any setting. So while the difference between what we see and what’s actually there might be most obvious when we look at optical illusions, the brain’s ability to jump to (sometimes incorrect) conclusions is also fundamental to our ability to successfully navigate our visual environment.

The strangeness of illusions, though, makes them a powerful tool for understanding how the sense of sight works. The optical illusions you may have paged through as a youngster—the Hermann grid, color aftereffects, and the Müller-Lyer illusion, to name a few—have helped scientists chip away at the mysteries of our visual system. These illusions powerfully demonstrate how sensitive our brains are to context and how readily they adapt to, and begin to ignore, unchanging stimuli.

Clark and his colleagues wanted to understand a class of illusions called peripheral drift illusions, in which stationary patterns seem to move when they are not looked at directly. Specifically, they focused on a relatively simple version of this illusion, in which sections of a ring transition smoothly from white to black and then suddenly back to white, like in the image below. If you look to the side of the illusion, so that it lies in your peripheral vision, you should see the rings rotate. Blinking quickly can enhance the effect.

Unlike most scientists who study illusions, Clark didn’t examine this illusion in humans and other primates. Instead, his team studied it in flies—specifically, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, known among scientists for their usefulness in biological experiments and among the rest of us for their tendency to flock around compost bins.","It may cause people to experience less empathy for others.

215,Oculus Primed: Meet the Geniuses Who Finally Mastered Virtual Reality,"In May 2012, a programmer named John Carmack—who, as a cofounder of id Software and the man behind games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, is widely seen as the father of 3D gaming—tweeted a picture of what looked like steampunk bifocals made out of a black shoebox. “This is a lot cooler than it looks,” read the caption.

He was right.

Since then, that awkward contraption—now more streamlined, and known as the Oculus Rift—has become the most anticipated new product in gaming since the Nintendo Wii got people off the couch. It’s a head-mounted display that promises to be a gigantic step toward what many had dismissed as an unrealizable dream: virtual reality.

The Rift is the brainchild of a 19-year-old tinkerer and VR enthusiast named Palmer Luckey. A collector of old VR headsets, Luckey was all too familiar with the shortcomings every system had faced—small fields of vision, unwieldy form factors, horrific resolution. He was also uniquely suited to do something about it: Years of modding videogame consoles and refurbishing iPhones for fun and profit had given him enough fine-soldering skills to start Frankensteining pieces from his existing headset collection. Eventually, chronicling his efforts on a message board devoted to 3D gaming, he figured out a way to cobble together a headset with a field of vision that dwarfed anything else on the market and allowed people to become completely immersed in a 360-degree playspace.

Luckey originally envisioned his creation as a DIY kit for hobbyists; after joining up with two partners and officially incorporating, though, they realized they could have a game-changing consumer peripheral on their hands. They began pre-selling $300 prototype headsets to software developers on Kickstarter in August 2012, just weeks after Carmack had taken his early version (on loan from Luckey) to the E3 gaming trade show. They pulled in nearly $2.5 million—and in spring of 2013, when those units began shipping to developers, virtual reality started to seem a lot less virtual.

Since then, the hype has only gotten louder. Oculus brought an improved version of the Rift to E3 in June and showed off its 1080p resolution as well as demos that placed wearers inside a virtual movie theater watching a trailer for Man of Steel. For the first time, applications beyond gaming began to suggest themselves. People, to use the clinical term, freaked out. Hell, I freaked out. Media coverage was rapturous; devoted Oculus forums and subreddits proliferated. Oculus launched a project depository for game demos, and developers responded, creating completely new experiences for a completely new medium.

Now they just need to build a consumer version that can pay off the promise of Luckey’s early experiments. And now that the company has received $75 million in Series B funding from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz—which sources say value the company at more than $250 million—the stakes are even higher. Before the official consumer version of the Rift (known internally as V1) becomes available in 2014, they’ll have to iron out seemingly innumerable kinks, from finalizing the display tech to deciding exactly what features will be included. But first and foremost, they’ll have to solve a problem that has plagued VR since the days of Tron: how not to make people sick.","It could make people nauseous.

216,Virtual Trade Tough Nut to Crack,"When Blizzard Entertainment recently announced an aggressive policy against trafficking in the virtual goods of the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft, it stirred up an old controversy about whether secondary market trading is something game companies can stop.

For years, companies like Sony Online Entertainment have prohibited the buying or selling of goods from games such as EverQuest. Despite such rules, which are commonly spelled out in MMOs' terms of service, the secondary market for virtual goods is estimated at $880 million annually.

Many in the virtual worlds community are now trying to determine what methods game developers can use, if any, to retard the growth of such transactions or even if anything should be done.

""There's a lot of debate about whether anything could be done,"" said Ed Castronova, an expert on the economies of virtual worlds. ""People get wrapped up in the mechanics of this particular technology. The broad question is whether someone with policy tools can affect how someone acts.""

In its announcement on the World of Warcraft community site, Blizzard stated its policy against the buying or selling of the game's objects for real-world money. Its goal, which many MMO developers share, is keeping the game pure from an inflated economy and from players who buy game attributes rather than earning them. And they often claim that such objects have no real-world economic value.

""If you are found to be selling in-game property (such as coins, items or characters) for real money,"" the policy says, ""you will lose your characters and accounts, and Blizzard Entertainment reserves its right to pursue legal action against you as well.""

Castronova, and others, feel that Blizzard can stop such illicit activity, much of which happens on eBay, through actively tracking down buyers and sellers and banning them from the game.

""I think that could have a substantial impact on the demand,"" Castronova said.

But others think such campaigns are pointless.

""The secondary market continues to grow exponentially,"" said Brock Pierce, CEO of IGE, one of the largest secondary market trading companies. ""Someone will always be there, because someone else is willing to pay for it.""

The problem, say some virtual world experts, is that many players see the objects they earn or build through countless hours of play as property. And property has value.

""In cases where the users' contribution to the game constitutes a new intellectual property or new content,"" said Philip Rosedale, CEO of Second Life developer Linden Lab, ""I'd say it makes no sense and is probably indefensible to claim that you can't traffic in those products and that those products have no inherent value.""

Linden Lab is one of the few developers that encourages transactions in the goods and services created in its game. But some economists agree that it is fruitless to ignore the common perception that virtual goods have a measurable economic value outside the game.

""They can stop in-world transfers completely,"" said Dan Hunter, an assistant professor of legal studies at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""If you do that, you have a completely different property system than you have now, where only that which you have is yours.... That goes against our expectations of capitalism.""","It could lead to players feeling like they own the game's objects, and that these objects have a real-world value. This could cause inflation in the game's economy, and lead to players buying game attributes instead of earning them.",https://www.wired.com/2004/12/virtual-trade-tough-nut-to-crack/,2004-12-20 07:00:00+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.8466431498527527,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,Economy
217,Creator of “Second Life” Issues Warnings for Those Building Metaverses,"As hype around metaverses steadily rises to a fever pitch, many early innovators of digital worlds have been quick to offer up their advice — and stern warnings — to those building them.

Such was the case with Philip Rosedale, the founder of the virtual world “Second Life,” who recently spoke to Time along with anthropologist and author of Coming of Age in Second Life Tom Boellstorff about their insights on building metaverses. Part of his advice was a thought-provoking warning about creating a moderation system that allows users to “equitably co-exist in a metaverse.”

“There are things like getting identity right, so you’re not doxxing a person by identifying the real person behind the avatar — but the avatar or the pseudonym of the individual is sufficiently stable so there are consequences to their actions and they’re going to behave well,” he told the magazine. “But we are simply not there yet on the internet: We don’t have identity systems yet that would enable strong governance.”

Boelstorff also added that there needs to be a strong framework in place in order to prevent bad actors from using the platform for harm. In fact, he said that since users had to pay for a “Second Life” subscription, ad-driven corporations weren’t able to exploit it as effectively as a platform like Facebook or Twitter.

“The subscription model of ‘Second Life’ is one reason that you don’t have misinformation and anti-vax stuff,” Boellstorff told Time. “None of this metaverse stuff going forward has to be a particular corporate ad-driven model.”

Another warning Rosedale had for metaverse developers is that they have to contend with its sizable barrier to entry. After all, in order to access the metaverse, you’ll likely need to have a host of expensive technological equipment including a computer, VR headset, and a stellar internet connection. He added that even with all that, many users often still “don’t want to be a cartoon avatar while wearing a VR headset.”

Even when you set the technology aside, there will be large swaths of the population who will likely still have little to no interest in spending time in a metaverse, no matter how hard you try.

“If you live a comfortable life in New York City and you’re young and healthy, you probably are going to choose to live there. If I offer you the life of an avatar, you’re just not going to use it very much,” Rosedale said. “On the other hand, if you live in a rural location with very little social contact, are disabled or live in an authoritarian environment where you don’t feel free to speak, then your avatar can become your primary identity.”

Rosedale’s insights are actually very tame and supportive when compared to other early metaverse innovators. In an essay published on his company’s blog this summer, Pokémon Go creator John Hanke asserted that the metaverse would be a “dystopian nightmare” if created in VR. Meanwhile, AR pioneer Louis Rosenberg penned an op-ed where he expressed a similar concern “about the legitimate uses of AR by the powerful platform providers that will control the infrastructure.”

Only time will tell if some rendition of the metaverse does end up fulfilling their Cassandran warnings. At the very least, developers might want to take the advice of the creator of one of the most popular and successful virtual worlds of all time.

218,The Virtual Reality Sim That Helps Teach Cops When to Shoot,"“I gotta get the guns,” Scott Digiralomo tells me over his shoulder as he leads me down the cinder block hallways of the Morris County Public Safety Training Academy in Morristown, New Jersey. Digiralomo, director of the county’s Department of Law and Public Safety, ducks into an empty room and, out of a large black safe, fetches an M4 rifle and a Glock.

At this point you should know that as a writer who works in Manhattan, lives in one of the yuppiest neighborhoods in Brooklyn, and gets panicky just passing by armed officers in the New York City subway, this is not how my days typically begin. And yet, no more than 30 minutes later, there I am, a Glock tucked into the holster on my right hip and a can of pepper spray in the left, cautiously approaching a woman in a white SUV who is blocking her ex-boyfriend’s driveway, refusing to let him and his new girlfriend leave.

“Get that crazy bitch out of here now!” yells the new girlfriend, standing in front of the house as I wander up the lawn. Before I can take another step, shots ring out from the SUV. I freeze, and a beat later, clumsily pull the weapon from my hip.

“Uh, put your hands up? And your weapon down? Please?” I say too politely, as if asking a waitress for another basket of bread. But it works. The shooter emerges from the car in a gray hoodie and jeans. She’s still screaming, but she drops the gun and falls to her knees, arms raised. In that instant, I’m pretty sure the situation’s under control, so I take a second to wonder what I’m supposed to do next.

And then she shoots me.

Behind me, Digiralomo is laughing, not because he’s some masochist who’s going to watch me bleed to death, but because the entire scenario, as you may have guessed, is a virtual reality simulation, and I---standing in the middle of the darkened room, surrounded by an array of screens, doing what has to be the world’s worst impersonation of a cop---look like a total tool.

But while this may have been little more than an exercise in embarrassment for me, Digiralomo assures me that this system, designed by a company called VirTra, is actually critical in helping police officers hone their skills as decision makers before they’re let out in the real world. Morris County installed the technology last November, smack dab in the middle of one of the most contentious periods in recent history between police and the public. And while Digiralomo says that wasn’t why the academy bought the roughly $300,000 system, it’s hard not to see the connection.

Not Can You Shoot But Should You

The fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer cracked open the scab on one of our country’s oldest wounds. It fueled new conversations about centuries-old issues and exposed gaping rifts across the entire country, not only on the subject of whether Officer Darren Wilson was justified in shooting Brown, but on whether or not minorities living in the United States are safe in the hands of the police officers that are hired to protect them. No amount of technology will ever solve these deeply rooted societal issues. Systems like VirTra’s---so-called cave automatic virtual environment, or CAVE, systems---have been around for a while. But as President Obama and others call for more robust police training, training technology that can simulate a world more like the real one takes on an added urgency.

Today, in states like New Jersey where Digiralomo works, officers are required to re-qualify for the police force twice a year by testing their shooting accuracy on a gun range. While that demonstrates that officers can use their weapons, it doesn’t necessarily help them understand whether they should.","A potential downside to using virtual reality as a training tool for police officers is that it may create a false sense of confidence and competence. While VR can provide a realistic simulation of some real-world situations, it can never completely replicate the unpredictable and often chaotic nature of real-life encounters. As a result, officers who have only trained in VR may be ill-prepared for the complexities and challenges of dealing with actual people and events.",https://www.wired.com/2015/03/virtra/,2015-03-30 11:00:45+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9966824650764464,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
219,I Watched the Debate in Virtual Reality. Things Got Weird,"The first Democratic debate is nearly over. The candidates are delivering their closing arguments, trying to explain in 90 seconds why he, or she, should be our next president. Just as Bernie Sanders is winding up for a rousing climax, an error message pops up before my eyes. My phone has overheated, the Oculus software says, and the Gear VR headset needs a break to cool down.

So I wait. I stare at the frozen screen, Sanders' arm in mid-gesticulation, because what else am I going to look at? I'm wearing a virtual reality headset. I can't even see my hands, much less find my phone to putter around Twitter.

A few minutes later, the stream returns. It seems I've moved. I had been sitting in the wing, to the right of the stage. Now I'm on stage, the debate's over, and I'm watching the aftermath. I see Hillary Clinton and Sanders giving interviews, then watch as the TV cameras shut off and the CNN reporters bound into the audience to gather quotes. Suddenly I move again. I'm perched high above the stage, watching from behind. I see Martin O'Malley wander behind his lectern, grab the mug he's been slyly drinking from all night, and walk off stage like he's stolen something.

Watching a debate in virtual reality is weird.

The Beltway on Your Face

Last night, CNN aired the first Democratic debate of the 2016 election to millions of TV viewers, and to an indeterminate but undoubtedly much smaller number of virtual-reality headset owners. CNN worked with California company NextVR, which is building a live-broadcast infrastructure for the VR community. Using Oculus's software and Samsung's hardware, they brought a real-time broadcast to face-computer-wearing viewers everywhere.

To view the debate, you had to own a Samsung Gear VR, which means you had to own one of a small handful of Samsung phones. Then you had to figure out how to install, update, and run all the right apps at the right time. (Heaven help you if this was your first time using the Gear VR.) Once it got rolling, though, the stream was pretty smooth.

It was like being in Disney World's Hall of Presidents, watching a bunch of animatronic not-quite-people reenacting historical events.

A presidential debate is a high-stakes place to run your first experiment, but NextVR co-founder DJ Roller says that's exactly the point. He wants people to know about virtual reality's potential as a live, breaking-news medium. ""It's really about the promise of VR is to put people in places they wish they could go, or maybe couldn't go. And what better place to do that than with news?""

NextVR's goal is to make bringing VR to a TV broadcast trivial. ""We can walk into any broadcast environment and just plug right in,"" he says, ""because we're built on this broadcast infrastructure."" For the debate, they set up Red cameras around the Wynn Hotel auditorium in Las Vegas, each offering a different vantage point for viewers.

For two hours, I was periodically teleported between four locations: the far back-right of the room; up front, alongside the moderators; the wing to stage right; and a bird's-eye-view from behind the candidates. Talking to Roller and CNNMoney executive producer Jason Farkas, who led the project for CNN, I get the sense they wanted many more. And they wanted them to be closer than the TV setup would allow.",People may not be able to distinguish between what is real and what is not.

221,The Oculus Rift Game That's So Real It Nearly Destroyed Me,"I can hear the alien breathing.

I've played lots of videogames, lots of run-and-gun shooters in which I happily charge down a corridor into certain death. Not this time. I've got my back pressed against the wall of an abandoned spaceship, and I'm inching down a hallway, my head darting left and right, looking for danger everywhere.

And I wonder, is this the one? Is this the Oculus Rift demo where I rip the headset off my face and bolt, terrified, out of the room?

I don't get scared by horror movies or horror videogames. Sure, you can startle the hiccups out of me with a well-timed jump scare, but that only proves my lizard brain is firing on all cylinders. For the most part, I feel a pronounced disconnect between the frightening scenario onscreen and the safety of my living room. I don't understand how some of my friends cannot bear to even pick up the controller and walk down a hallway in Resident Evil.

So it came as quite a surprise when I found myself so truly on edge that I almost lost it while playing Sega's Alien: Isolation demo on Oculus Rift. The game, shown at E3 this year, is a custom VR prototype based on the survival horror game coming to PC and consoles October 7. More than that, though, it's another compelling demonstration of how Oculus Rift has the potential to make gaming so immersive that the fantasy becomes reality.

Sega won't say whether it plans to make the Oculus version a full-fledged consumer product, but it would be crazy not to. I'd played VR demos in which I truly believed I had been transported, but also demos where I felt like I was watching a bad movie on a really huge screen. Alien: Isolation was very much the former. The clever hook of the console game---exploring a lonesome world inhabited only by you and a lone alien, which you spend the entire game avoiding---is a perfect fit for Oculus.

""Like everyone else, we got very excited by the idea of Oculus Rift when it was first going into the Kickstarter,"" said Al Hope, creative lead of developer The Creative Assembly's console division. His team already was working on Isolation when Oculus launched its Kickstarter drive two years ago, and it seemed the two would work well together. Several Creative Assembly developers backed the crowdfunding drive, and they got Isolation running on Rift as soon as their initial development kits arrived.

Sitting down for the demo, I endured the now-familiar ritual of having an Oculus rep place the development kit over my head before clamping a pair of headphones over my ears. And then it began.

Suddenly, I'm walking down a quiet, seemingly deserted hallway on an abandoned spaceship. The demo runs on DK2, the latest version of the Oculus development hardware, so it is clean, vivid, smooth.

222,EchoPixel's breakthrough VR tech lets doctors look inside your body,"Think of EchoPixel’s tech like InnerSpace but instead of actually minimizing scientists and shooting them into your body to find disease, the medical imaging startup lets doctors pinpoint problem areas from CT, MRI, and ultrasound scans using 3D glasses and a special display.

Most doctors view CT scans in 2D, meaning they can’t see in and around all the details of your body, so it’s harder to find the exact problem. Some even resort to bringing hand-drawn sketches into the operating room. EchoPixel CTO Sergio Aguirre says “It’s really a shame that doctors are still using the same 2D images designed in 1880.”

But with EchoPixel and 3D glasses, internal organs pop off the screen like holograms so doctors can virtually examine a patient from any angle. EchoPixel could radically improve healthcare while reducing time and costs for hospitals and patients. It’s one of the most promising ways virtual reality is making in-roads in healthcare.

EchoPixel achieves this technological feat by employing the 300 million 3D radiology scans performed in the U.S. each year. But instead of flattening them onto a 2D screen, its real-time, interactive 3D imaging system allows doctors to peer into every corner and crevice of your body.

Information can be tailored for specific procedures, and doctors are able to zoom in and pull out something that doesn’t look right from your body scan, or 3D print the image to have a working model for further study. A weird bump or lesion on your intestines is easier to find and examine, for example.

The 3D tech’s ability to virtually enlarge tiny parts of the body is especially helpful for treating newborns. Clinical studies showed doctors were able to find up to 90 percent more congenital heart defects amongst newborns in 40 percent less time. It’s also much quicker to size medical devices like stents because doctors can examine in 3D the place they’ll go. One trial showed sizing time reduced from 40 minutes to just 2.

EchoPixel refers to the tech as interactive VR, even though it’s not like Vive or Oculus. In fact, it’s more convenient. Instead of having to strap on and off a VR headset in the middle of a procedure, doctors can just glance to the side and see the 3D image of what they’re working on.

The startup this year raised a $5.8 million seed round, and is now selling three-year subscriptions to its technology for $25,000 a year. Other companies in the space include Surgical Theater and RealView.

EchoPixel already has the go-ahead from the FDA, and will now seek approvals for Europe and Asia. Eventually, doctors could let precise robots do the incisions while they control them via EchoPixel a few feet away.

We got to try out the new technology on a recent visit to EchoPixel’s Palo Alto, California headquarters, as well as interview one of the doctors now using the product, UCSF’s Dr. Judy Yee, who’s been able to catch potentially cancerous lesions in the gut with EchoPixel.

224,Virtual Mirror: augmented reality without glasses,"

The Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute — the same Fraunhofer that holds many of the patents on MP3 — have a booth at CEATEC exhibiting some of their research efforts, shopping them around for potential licensees. Their Virtual Mirror display is, I think, a great example of augmented reality done right. It uses a camera, a display, and their special software to dynamically alter the image projected back to the viewer.

The concept of a mirror realizes augmentation without the customer needing to wear glasses. No additional equipment has to be used as you can just step into the application and move freely like in front of a real mirror. This significantly enhances acceptability and immsersiveness while also reducing the effort needed for supervising such an application.

Here’s a quick video:

Note how the shadows of the shirt are preserved. This is the kind of detail that really makes augmented reality believable. Without that nuance, our brains (or at least my brain) kind of gives up trying to make the whole thing work. I was particularly impressed by how well the deformations were preserved as the guy stretched and pulled his shirt.

And I stand corrected: the lady watching and not-watching TV at CEATEC does not have the best job of the event. This guy does!

225,First Conservation Laws Derived For A Virtual Universe,"And yet, peer more closely at Noether’s theorem and you soon find its severe limitations. It turns out that this approach can only be applied to certain types of systems that have continuous symmetries.

That specifically excludes discrete systems, which proceed step-by-step. These include systems such as Turing machines, which one or two readers may be familiar with.

Take for example, Conway’s famous game of life, in which life-like forms can be generated using a cellular automaton. This takes place on a square grid which is symmetrical under quarter-turn rotations, but not under continuous rotations. And in this world, time advances in discrete steps rather than continuous ones.

Clearly Noether’s theorem cannot apply. So what happens to the conservation laws? In the game of life do we have to abandon conservation of energy, angular momentum and the like?

Today, Tommasso Tofoli at Boston University and Silvio Capobianco at Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia tackle exactly these questions. Their answer is a relief, of sorts–they find a family of discrete systems that obey a Noether-like theorem and show why.

The system they study is called an Ising spin model. It is a 2D array of elementary magnets that can each point either up or down. Each magnet is coupled to its four nearest neighbours by the mathematical equivalent of a rubber band. The band is stretched if the neighbour spins in the opposite direction and loose if it spins in the same direction.

The question that Toffoli and Capobianco study is how this system behaves, how the spins flip from one state to another, but first they impose an important limit on the kind of interactions that can occur.

This condition is that a spin will flip only if doing so leaves the sum of the potential energies of the four surrounding bonds unchanged. This can happen if two of the neighbours have parallel spins while the other two have antiparallel spins. This type of system is called a microcanonical Ising model.

This condition has important consequences. It means that potential energy is always conserved.

But think about this in more detail and it becomes a little difficult to pin down exactly what we mean by energy. The number of spin up and down magnets can of course change dramatically so this is not what it is conserved. However, the boundary between them must always be the same length. So if we define the length of this line as energy, then this is what is naturally conserved.

(Of course, the magnets, rubber bands and potential energies are not real but merely useful ways to think about this system.)

That may seem an arbitrary definition for energy but Toffoli and Capobianco go on to show that it has the same mathematical properties of energy in the real universe (defining energy in our world is itself mighty hard to do).

Of course, there is another aspect of this system that is easy to forget but crucial for conservation. This is the structure of the discrete space-time in which all the action takes place, in other words, the 2D grid and the time steps over which change takes place.

The climax of Toffoli and Capobianco’s paper is their demonstration that energy can only be conserved if the space-time is invariant, that all directions and times in this Ising Universe are essentially equivalent.

In this way, they show how a Noether-like theorem can apply in a discrete universe.

That’s hugely significant. It means that the same rules of symmetry that have been powerfully applied to modern physics can also apply to the many new disciplines that are beginning to exploit discrete models. These include many social sciences, complexity science, economics, web science and of course, the biggie: computer science.

In effect, these guys have used symmetry to derive conservation laws in a virtual world for the first time.

But the significance goes deeper still. The thing that links all these disciplines is information. They are all part of of a new thrust in modern science which ignores the superficial properties of physical reality and instead focuses on a deeper bedrock: the information on which the universe is built.

Although they don’t say this explicitly, what Toffoli and Capobianco are studying is the role that Noether-like theorems can play in this new world of information-based science.

Of course, it raises many questions too. Toffoli and Capobianco give just a single example of a discrete system in which a Noether-like theorem applies. What many people will want to know is how this can be generalised. For example, can it be made to apply to Conway’s game of life?

Either way, Toffoli and Capobianco have made a promising start. As they say themselves: “This is just the beginning of what promises to be a productive line of research.”

226,"Music's Salvation Might Be Selling Not Songs, But VR","Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

So here's a strange thing about making VR videos: turns out it's really hard to show a rough cut. Even once you've done the complicated 360-degree shooting, and your computational algorithms have stitched all the footage together into something realistic and immersive, you still need to fine-tune the edits, sound effects, and visuals so you don't disorient your viewers (or worse). Looking at a two-dimensional version on a laptop doesn't really do it justice, and if you're dealing with people in remote locations the chances are basically zero that everyone will have their own Oculus Rift to weigh in on the footage.

Considering all that, Stuart Cripps' jitters are understandable. The heavyset, soft-spoken British director is working on a VR project for a 20-year-old Irish singer-producer named Jonathon Ng, known to his fans as Eden. The song, ""Drugs,"" is the second single from Ng's new EP. Cripps has been working on the video for months, but nobody outside his studio has seen anything. Now, on a blisteringly hot day in early June, two weeks before the video's scheduled release, he has something to show. It's just not finished yet.

A dozen people, all involved with the project in some way, file into a post-production office near Universal Studios in L.A. While they crowd onto couches and chairs and try to loop Ng in from his home in Dublin, Cripps walks them through his vision; after a few minutes of high-mindedness---""I imagine us going from dust to dust,"" he says, all but staring wistfully out the window---he leads everyone downstairs and gestures towards a swivel chair and an Oculus Rift dev kit. As with so much about VR, the only way to really get the video is to try it.

Outside of games, music is almost certainly the most popular content type in VR right now, which makes sense both technically—right now, VR's best for quick viewing periods, about the length of your average song—and creatively. Both formats trade in experiences, connection, and immersion. You don't go to a concert for the sound quality; you go to be part of something. ""Today’s adolescents,"" music writer/analyst/crank Bob Lefsetz wrote earlier this year, ""are enthralled by YouTube stars and others who evidence a personality, there’s a human bond between them and their heroes and there’s this feeling that the famous and the hoi polloi are in it together."" That feeling also happens to be the kind of thing fans will pay for, which is hard to come by in today's music industry. Meanwhile, one industry forecast pegs VR and AR as a $120 billion business by 2020, and everybody wants a slice. The tech and the content seem like a perfect match. But figuring out how to make it all work? That's another thing entirely.

Music in the round

Musicians have been experimenting with VR longer than almost anyone. Most of the early projects go one of two ways: Either someone sets up a camera on stage at a concert, so you get to watch the show from the perspective of a weird band member who doesn't play anything and just kind of stands there, or the band plays while standing in a circle around a camera, as if the show's just for you. Whether either even counts as virtual reality, or is just ""360 video,"" depends on who you ask. But everybody's doing it: Coldplay, Avicii, U2, Bjork, Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift, the cast of Broadway's Lion King. Run The Jewels' ""Crown"" is a particularly cool, in-your-face example.

A few others go a step further, using the immersive power of VR to make music videos more interesting. Ray Lamontagne's ""Hey, No Pressure"" video drops you into a kaleidoscopic acid trip of a dance floor, where dancers gyrate and lights flash to the beat of the song. Earlier this year, Dawn Richard dropped a bonkers VR space jam, full of holograms and intergalactic surroundings.

Regardless of genre or feel, all those projects have one thing in common: they don't sing you a song so much as drop you into the middle of one. ""In traditional music videos,"" says Chris Milk, a celebrated music video director turned founder of VR company Within, ""the viewer is outside of the experience, looking inward. In VR, people are right in the middle of it."" Narrative, story-first music videos---like Michael Jackson's 13-minute ""Thriller"" epic, to name the one that literally everyone mentions whenever they bring this up---just don't work in VR. Not yet, anyway. What VR does best right now is enhance the sort of raw, Rorschach emotion that makes music powerful in the first place.

The best example of VR's potential so far is probably ""Old Friend,"" a much-loved piece by animator Tyler Hurd that's set to a Future Islands song of the same name. You put on your headset, and an outrageous dance party starts all around you. Using the HTC Vive's controllers and positional tracking, your avatar dances however you dance. Hurd was making the video for less powerful systems like the Gear VR, but he found the Vive's full-body experience irresistible. ""As soon as you start leaning around and looking at things,"" he says, ""they feel more real. You stop wondering and you just let yourself be there."" He calls his video ""an overwhelming barrage of nonsensical joy."" It's not a game or a story; it's an experience, a place.

Cripps and the ""Drugs"" crew wanted to create a similarly visceral effect—and the song, mellow and moody, was a perfect match. ""Everyone kind of immediately felt like 'Drugs' was the best fit,"" Ng says. Cripps and his crew shot with a strange-looking rig: a Canon 5D on top of a Kinect, which together capture real-time three-dimensional data using beta software created by a New York company called DepthKit. The resulting aesthetic is pure wireframed data, like a glitchy Tron landscape crossed with Star Trek's Holodeck. At one point the picture floats over a mesh surface, panning down and out until you realize it's an outline of a person playing the keyboard.","It may cause people to experience motion sickness.

So what would happen if you took a drone, attached twin video cameras to it, and had each of those cameras feed directly into one half of an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset? Now take it a step further: Have the drone-mounted twin video cameras track the head movements of the wearer of the Oculus headset.

This would give you a drone that you could fly, and also use as a personal set of eyes in the sky, in real-time, fed directly into the very headset that is tracking your head motions to guide the aircraft’s vision.

Yeah, that would be pretty cool. Happily, it’s already been built:","It could lead to people becoming more isolated from the real world.

228,This Ebola Documentary Shows VR Film's Radical Potential,"An intense new virtual reality film isn't a documentary so much as it is a prayer; its lector is a young Liberian woman named Decontee Davis, and her benediction is a plea for help to rebuild her country after Ebola ravaged it in 2014.

""I remember the fear—the fear people had of me,"" Davis says in a voiceover discussing her own time fighting the disease. ""They were too scared to even touch me. And I was scared of my own child. I was scared of the man I loved. Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me.""

Davis’ words are hard to hear, but they’re even harder to hear as the sights and sounds of her world swim around you. And in Waves of Grace, a collaboration between VR studio Vrse and the United Nations that's out today on the Vrse app, that’s just what they do. Davis, an Ebola survivor who uses her immunity to work with children orphaned by the disease, is our guide through the country, but she is also an educator—teaching her own community and anyone who watches Waves that survivors pose no threat to the public.

It’s a powerful message even when read on paper, but when heard while standing amongst the orphans themselves and the graves of some of the more than 4,800 lives Ebola has claimed in Liberia, it’s downright heartbreaking. And that’s why the UN wants people to experience it in VR: the immediacy of the 360-degree view gives the film a poignancy that a news report simply can’t.

“A YouTube video or a talk can give you information but not necessarily the ability to immerse yourself in the world of another, and also interact with people,” says Gabo Arora, the UN senior advisor and filmmaker who made Waves with Vrse. “There’s something about how VR is being made—there’s a spontaneity and naturalness that’s not necessarily coming out in other means.”

A YouTube video or a talk, it can give you information but not necessarily the ability to immerse yourself in the world of another. UN filmmaker Gabo Arora

Arora has seen it work before. His last Vrse collaboration was Clouds Over Sidra, a VR experience about a young Syrian refugee in Jordan. That project was so good at showing the situation for Syrian refugees that it received the backing of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and has proven effective at helping raise awareness—and money—for humanitarian efforts. (Recent numbers from UNICEF in New Zealand found that one in six people who saw Sidra donated, a rate double the norm, Arora says.)

The power of Clouds also helped encourage Arora’s subject. Davis had already been a central figure in a Washington Post report when Arora approached her about participating in the UN’s new VR endeavor, and thus felt as though she had already told her story. Hoping to convince her, Arora showed Davis Clouds; that changed everything. “She said ‘Oh my God, of course. Anything you want,'"" he says.

Arora, who plans to continue making VR experiences for the UN, says the immersive nature of the medium can also be a huge help within the UN. It’s important for the organization to stay aware of humanitarian situations all over the world, but large expeditions to already-vulnerable regions can be disruptive. Sending one small VR crew to the area and then letting people at the UN see their findings can cut down on that disruption, he claims.","It may make people more likely to donate to humanitarian efforts. While this is a good thing, it may also lead to people feeling more removed from the reality of the situation. Seeing VR footage of a disaster may make people feel like they are doing something to help, when in reality they are not. This could lead to people becoming complacent about humanitarian crises, and not actually doing anything to help.",https://www.wired.com/2015/09/vr-ebola-film/,2015-09-01 17:00:19+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9953891038894652,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,"Information, Discourse & Governance"
229,These Virtual Obstacle Courses Help Real Robots Learn to Walk,"An army of more than 4,000 marching doglike robots is a vaguely menacing sight, even in a simulation. But it may point the way for machines to learn new tricks.

The virtual robot army was developed by researchers from ETH Zurich in Switzerland and chipmaker Nvidia. They used the wandering bots to train an algorithm that was then used to control the legs of a real-world robot.

In the simulation, the machines—called ANYmals—confront challenges like slopes, steps, and steep drops in a virtual landscape. Each time a robot learned to navigate a challenge, the researchers presented a harder one, nudging the control algorithm to be more sophisticated.

From a distance, the resulting scenes resemble an army of ants wriggling across a large area. During training, the robots were able to master walking up and down stairs easily enough; more complex obstacles took longer. Tackling slopes proved particularly difficult, although some of the virtual robots learned how to slide down them.

Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. A clip from the simulation where virtual robots learn to climb steps.

When the resulting algorithm was transferred to a real version of ANYmal, a four-legged robot roughly the size of a large dog with sensors on its head and a detachable robot arm, it was able to navigate stairs and blocks but suffered problems at higher speeds. Researchers blamed inaccuracies in how its sensors perceive the real world compared to the simulation,

Similar kinds of robot learning could help machines learn all sorts of useful things, from sorting packages to sewing clothes and harvesting crops. The project also reflects the importance of simulation and custom computer chips for future progress in applied artificial intelligence.

“At a high level, very fast simulation is a really great thing to have,” says Pieter Abbeel, a professor at UC Berkeley and cofounder of Covariant, a company that is using AI and simulations to train robot arms to pick and sort objects for logistics firms. He says the Swiss and Nvidia researchers “got some nice speed-ups.”","It may lead to machines becoming too reliant on simulations. If machines are only trained in simulations, they may not be able to handle real-world situations as effectively.

230,How to Shoot a 360 Video,"Unlike traditional video cameras, which capture whatever is happening in front of them, 360 cameras capture everything happening in every direction, offering a full spherical view of the surroundings.

Get the Right Camera

Each of these all-seeing mechanical eyes is different. The best ones are truly omnidirectional—meaning they capture their full surroundings instead of a truncated portion of the scene. The most convenient cameras also produce videos that can be edited and shared with simple software tools and don't require any laborious stitching or post-processing. For the purposes of this article, we'll look at the cameras that hit those points: 360 degrees of capture with an easy path to editing and sharing.

Some of the best are the Ricoh Theta, Nikon's Keymission 360, Samsung's Gear 360, and Kodak's Pix Pro Dual Pack. All of these cameras use two fisheye lenses pointed in opposite directions. The images from these two lenses are stitched together by the software that comes with the camera to give you a truly spherical video. There are other cameras, like the 360Fly, which use one ultra-wide-angle lens, that don't offer a full spherical view. You can apply some of the advice in this article to using those types of cameras as well, you'll just get different results.

Take a Stand

These cameras capture everything—including the tripod you're using to prop it up. So, you’ll need a tripod without any adjustment arms that stick out into the shot. Travel tripods are ideal for this. They typically have a ball head that's adjusted with a knob instead of an arm. Also, they're lightweight and fold up into themselves. Since these 360 cameras lack a carrying strap and are a lot smaller than DSLRs, you can just walk around with the camera mounted on the tripod. It’s much more convenient.

Tip: If you don’t want to pay more than $100 for a new tripod, you can use a light stand instead. They're made for holding up lights at photo shoots, but they work for 360 cameras too. They’re lightweight, cheap, and most importantly, don’t have arms or levers that will get in the way.

Think of the camera as a human in the scene. Where would you stand? nicksmithwastaken

Find Proper Placement

An omnidirectional camera works best if you plop it in the middle of your scene. When the viewer watches your video in a full headset or a Cardboard viewer, they'll have the freedom to turn their head and look at anything they want. It’s one of the revolutionary features of this medium, but it also means they could completely miss what you're trying to show them.

Think of the camera as a human in the scene, and find the best place for them to 'stand' to witness the action.

You decide what the viewer's vantage point is within the scene. Make use of this power! Show the viewer a subject that cannot be adequately captured with a normal camera. Place the camera (ie, the viewer) somewhere visually stimulating, with lots to look at in every direction. Or, provide the viewer with a unique perspective such as a bird’s-eye or ant's-eye view of the world. You could even put them in the middle of a conversation between two people, making them feel like they are a part of it.

Think of the camera as a human in the scene, and find the best place for them to ""stand"" to witness the action. For example, if you were recording in your car, a bad shot would be placing the camera in the passenger seat—only half the video would contain any substance, while the other half would be a riveting image of a car seat. A better shot would be to put the camera between the dashboard and the windshield. This way the viewer can look around to see the driver and the road ahead.

These 360 consumer cameras utilize fisheye lenses. The curved lenses widen the camera’s field of view to capture all 360 degrees, but the also substantially distort the image. This means you have to keep some space between the camera and the subject. Not too much, or else you lose clarity and definition. The sweet spot for the placement of the camera is usually between three and five feet from the subject.

Learn Your Moves

For action shots, keep the camera steady and limit quick movements. If someone is watching in a headset and the camera is bouncing up and down, their experience may end in copious vomiting. Even if they’re just watching in a browser, it ruins the experience.

Also, there's a user interaction factor to consider. 360 videos let the viewer look at whatever they'd like, but when the camera is moving, the user suddenly isn't in total control of what's in the frame, and this creates a disconnect. The viewer may decide they want to look at something that's zipping by, but if the camera keeps moving, they’ll be fighting against the momentum. Eventually, they’ll get tired or angry and exit the video. It’s not a firm no-no to have movement in your video, but try to keep the experience friendly to the viewer.

Mind the Gap

Since 360 cameras are essentially just two cameras strapped back to back, there is a parallax effect where they meet—a non-congruent place in the image.

Learn where the stitch point is, and always be aware of it. nicksmithwastaken

The software that comes with these cameras mostly mitigates the parallax effect. It doesn’t completely fix it, but it just makes it looks like a minor glitch in the image. When the camera is moving as it records, everything the camera passes will be affected by the stitch line. That stitch point becomes quite noticeable when it cuts objects in half, so be careful not to position it point over something that's visually interesting.

Record and Run

Most 360 cameras have a mobile app that allows you to hit record or pause remotely. If you don’t want to be in the shot, you have two options: run and hide, or blend in with the environment. Trees and poles are great for hiding behind. You’ll get weird looks, but you’re probably already getting those looks because your camera doesn’t look like a normal camera. Weird looks come with the territory, get used to it.

Edit on a Curve

Editing, like everything else in this process, is different than it is with traditional video. Most 360 cameras do the hardest part for you: the stitching. Consumer cameras stitch your video with the press of a button either in a mobile app or in a free desktop app. When it comes time to edit and add titles, it gets tricky. You’re pasting the titles onto a round surface, not a flat one, and the spherical nature of the video means you can’t just plop text in like you’re used to.","The potential for nausea and vomiting.

231,Treating Cockroach Phobia With Augmented Reality,"Treating Cockroach Phobia With Augmented Reality describes, for the first time, a trial of augmented reality with a small group of people who all presented clinically significant levels of cockroach phobia. These six women reported problems that ranged from wanting to sell their apartments because they’d seen a cockroach or two in them to once spending two hours on top of a table, waiting for friends to arrive, after seeing a cockroach on the floor.

The system uses a typical VR google headset - the kind that completely obscures the wearer’s vision - coupled to a 6DOF, or six degrees of freedom tracking system which allows the computer to know exactly the location and orientation of a wearer’s head, so that it can line up the virtual world with the real.

Combined with a camera on the front of the headset, the system allows researchers to show wearers both the real world and realistic cockroaches. The paper reports that the roaches could skitter, wave their antenna, and even change size from small and medium to hideously large.

Patients were exposed, over the course of a single three hour session, to anything from a single stationary cockroach to up to 60 swarming, skittering bugs.

The results were a stunning: Study subjects went from a phobia so profound that it interfered with their lives to passing a “test” that involved walking into a room containing a cockroach in a tupperware container, removing its lid and placing their hand in it for at least a few seconds.

This work raises the possibility that augmented reality may be uniquely useful in treating phobias precisely because the fusion of the real and virtual worlds is so convincing - further suggesting that augmented reality will be particularly compelling in countless other applications, from manufacturing and education to gaming and… other entertainments.","A potential unintended consequence of virtual reality exposure therapy, as described in the above article, is that patients may become too comfortable with cockroaches and other insects and start to see them as harmless. This could lead to people becoming more relaxed around insects in general, which could have a negative impact on public health if, for instance, people started to ignore real-world warnings about disease-carrying insects.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/07/02/26487/treating-cockroach-phobia-with-augmented-reality/,2010-07-02 00:00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9960718154907228,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,MIT Tech Review,User Experience & Entertainment
232,Virtual Reality Allows Adults to See World Through a Child's Eyes,"When you're a kid, everything seems huge. Teachers tower over you; playgrounds stretch on to infinity. Now, researchers have found a way to make grownups feel the same way. By placing volunteers in virtual reality, scientists are helping adults see the world through the eyes of a child.

Virtual reality is more than an illusion. To enter it, people put on full-body suits that track their movements and goggles that display an artificial world in which they have a virtual body. If their virtual and real movements sync up, their computer-generated bodies start to seem real. Previous research has shown that subjects begin to feel like their body has changed into the simulated figure, even if it is different from their own body; volunteers placed into the body of a teenage girl, for example, ""felt it"" when her mother slapped her computer-generated representation. But scientists did not know how this virtual body ""ownership"" affected people's perception of the world around them and whether this could help people relate with others unlike themselves.

To find out, computer scientist Mel Slater of the University of Barcelona in Spain and colleagues placed adult volunteers into a virtual outdoor scene in which they did not have a computer-generated body. They were asked to estimate the sizes of six different cubes within the scene and were told whether their guesses were too big, too small, or correct. Later, they reentered the scene and repeated the exercise with three cubes, without feedback from the researchers. Their size estimates without a virtual body were noted.

After this training exercise, the researchers placed the subjects in two different avatars, virtual characters controlled by participants. One was a 4-year-old child of the same gender as the participant. The other was an adult who was the same height as the child. While standing in a virtual living room, the participants again gauged the size of the cubes without feedback.

Adults stated that they felt the two virtual bodies were equally real, and they misjudged object size in both avatars. But those in the child avatar rated the cubes about twice as large, on average, as did those in the adult bodies, Slater's team reports online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In a test after the simulation, participants who had been in the virtual child body were quicker to mischaracterize themselves with childlike traits than their actual ones. For example, someone who had embodied the virtual 4-year-old was more likely to identify themselves as attending primary school than someone who had embodied the scaled-down adult.

When movements of the virtual and real bodies did not match, participants no longer felt their avatars were real. They still overestimated the size of the cubes, but there were no differences between the adult and child avatars. The researchers conclude that the type of avatar can affect how people see their virtual environment only if they feel connected with their virtual body.

Slater notes that the experimental setup in this study could be used to help people empathize with others who are unlike themselves, for example by putting criminal offenders in the virtual body of the victim at the crime scene to help them see the event from the other perspective.

The study demonstrates that we may need to think harder about the implications of spending time in a digital world, says cognitive psychologist Jeremy Bailenson of Stanford University in California. He describes a hypothetical danger of Google Glass, a pair of glasses that gives users hands-free access to the Internet. ""If I'm using Google Glass and I'm in the avatar of a child, I may not be able to cross the street in the right manner because I'm seeing objects as a different size than they actually are out in nature.""

233,One Startup's Quest to Save Refugees With Virtual Reality,"F

Four boats approach the small harbor of Skala on the Greek island of Lesbos. The first vessel is occupied by agents of Frontex, the European Union border-control unit. The men are dressed in black, from helmets to combat boots. They tow the second boat, an inflatable dinghy with flimsy plywood baseboards that’s crammed from pontoon to pontoon with extremely cold people. Earlier this morning a smuggler in Izmir, Turkey, filled the raft with refugees from Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan, handed the throttle to a young man who’d never driven a boat, and pointed toward Greece. Like so many of the thousands of vessels provided by human-smuggling mafias, this one didn’t have enough fuel and ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of the Aegean.

The third boat, a gray Zodiac, found them. It’s manned by two young men—one an out-of-work Greek, the other a Norwegian bored with his stultifying Oslo desk job. Neither of them possesses an organizational affiliation. Despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have come through Lesbos in the past year, as of my visit on December 18, neither Frontex nor the Greek coast guard has established much of a presence. Instead, the job of offering aid falls largely to international volunteers who have flocked to the island. A throng of them, their experience ranging from extensive to none, waits onshore with reflective survival blankets. The emergencies director of Human Rights Watch is here, as is a fashion model from Manhattan who brought perfume samples for the refugees. As the Zodiac approaches the dock, the Norwegian hurls himself into the water and ties the boat up to a mooring.

Behind the scene trails the fourth boat, a wooden vessel owned by a local fisherman. On the bow, a bearded American named David Darg holds up a small virtual-reality camera called a Ricoh Theta. Thirty-seven years old, with a reddish-brown beard, tight black jeans, and the thick build of a logger, Darg occupies a unique and peculiar role within the fast-moving world of new media.1 On the one hand he’s a crisis responder and vice president of international operations at Operation Blessing, a faith-based nonprofit. But he’s also cofounder of Ryot, a Los Angeles for-profit company that specializes in hopeful video content from developing and disaster-affected nations. He has come to Lesbos to bring the reality of the migrant crisis to the wider world. Darg calls the VR camera in his hand a “transportation device,” one capable of essentially bringing Western viewers to the world’s strife-ridden places. “You register VR as an experience you had,” he says, “rather than something you see”—a common boast about VR.

“A lot of people will make a very cool, very expensive VR experience that very few people will see.”

This phenomenon, he suggests, allows him to convey nuanced reality like never before, cutting through a media landscape saturated with two-dimensional images of suffering. It’s also essential to his plan to change the way we consume global news. Darg and Ryot’s other cofounder, a former Peace Corps volunteer named Bryn Mooser, launched the company in 2012 while giving aid in post-earthquake Haiti. Mooser, Ryot’s CEO, is 36, a tall and charismatic entrepreneur who grew up in Santa Monica and moved to Zimbabwe with his mother at age 16, eventually studying film at Bennington College and joining the Peace Corps in Gambia. Darg and Mooser’s idea was to create a new form of short, impactful storytelling to buoy the humanitarian industry. At first the company billed itself as the future of news—a sell that seemed rather ambitious, sort of like an undermanned expansion team declaring itself the future of the NBA.

But in the past year, Ryot has positioned itself as the go-to VR company for both news and humanitarian advocacy. Recently the Huffington Post, NPR, and The New York Times have lined up to work with the company. Darg, who speaks in a calm, self-assured voice, finds the old guard’s attention delicious. “They’re coming and they’re asking us for advice,” he says. “Men in suits wondering what happened now that no one’s coming to their sites any more.”2

The Greek fisherman ties up to his mooring and Darg hops out. The volunteers swarm the asylum seekers, offering blankets and water. A CNN anchor cues her cameraman and says in a dire tone that the organizer of the Paris ISIS attacks may have come through Lesbos. An Australian woman in a “Love” beanie gives a head massage to a middle-aged Muslim refugee, whose face maintains an expression of mild horror. Other refugees take selfies. Soon everyone moves up the shoreline, past a lighthouse, an olive press, limp life jackets hanging in trees, and a relief camp run by anarchists, where two dogs in wool vests lounge amiably. The group reaches another ad hoc camp, where refugees receive food and dry clothes. On the street, Darg turns his VR camera onto a young Afghan named Mustafa and asks him to address Americans who are afraid of refugees.

Mustafa’s message is simple: “I lost my parents. I would love to be beside them and not here.” And then, just as he starts to thank Lesbos’ aid workers, a locally famous cross-dresser sashays by the shivering refugees in knee-high boots and red tights, his gray hair blowing in the wind. Darg’s camera is still running.","It may make people more fearful of refugees.

234,Doctors Are Using Mixed Reality to Treat COVID-19 Patients,"Image by Microsoft Treatments

Doctors in the U.K. have started using mixed reality headsets to communicate with their peers, drastically cutting down how many medical workers need to come into contact with COVID-19 patients.

The Microsoft goggles let the wearer communicate with colleagues or request information like x-ray results from technicians waiting safely in a different room, BBC News reports. And while the idea seems alien at first, doctors told BBC News they think the technology will definitely help limit future spread of the coronavirus.

“This is not a gimmick,” Dr. James Kinross, a surgeon at Imperial College, told BBC News. “It provides clinicians with capabilities that they cannot have with any other platform that’ll have immediate patient benefit.”

Relying on mixed reality to communicate with other medical staff who used to all work in the same room was a weird adjustment to make, Dr. Louis Koizia, a consultant physician at St. Mary’s hospital, told BBC News. But after getting used to it, he preferred it to the alternative.

“Initially it felt a little bit bizarre and a bit odd,” Koizia told BBC News. “But actually, if I compared it to the PPE and the visors and the goggles that I was wearing beforehand, it’s probably more comfortable.”

Kinross even suspects doctors will continue to use mixed reality after the pandemic ends.

“So I don’t see this technology going anywhere,” Kinross told BBC News. “In fact, if anything, I see this being much more widely deployed.”

235,VR porn is coming to hotels on the Las Vegas strip,"Sin City is about to get a bit more sinful, as VR content platform VR Bangers and headset maker AuraVisor are teaming up to offer in-room adult experiences (via virtual reality) at hotels on the strip in Las Vegas.

What makes this partnership particularly interesting is that users who purchase the in-room AuraVisor will be viewing content that was filmed in a hotel room that looks similar to the one where they’re staying, making the fantasy that much more immersive.

Interested hotel guests simply pay $20 on their credit card to have an AuraVisor headset in the room. This headset is pre-loaded with sexy-time content, and all the user has to do is specify the preferred gender of their virtual partner.

As Engadget points out, the partnership with AuraVisor makes sense as the Indiegogo- and Kickstarer-funded project is its own standalone headset, using Google’s Android software. That means that hotel guests won’t have to do anything with their own smartphones in order to use the AuraVisor.

Porn is undoubtedly one of the main predicted use-cases for virtual reality technology, but this implementation of such a thing has its own obstacles. For one, hygiene. Anything worn on the head or face should be properly sanitized before being shared. But on top of that, there’s the matter of dirty hands, etc. to deal with.

That said, there’s no place like Las Vegas to play fast and loose with keeping clean.

It’s unclear which hotels will roll out the platform, but we’ll keep you abreast of the situation.","Hygiene. Anything worn on the head or face should be properly sanitized before being shared.

236,"Yuck It Up, Humanity, Because VR Is Going To Make Things Really Weird","The Internetogencia was all in a tizzy this week as it commented on a cover photo from Time magazine extolling the simple joys of VR. The cover, if you haven’t seen it, features the disheveled founder of Oculus Rift, Palmer Luckey, who looked like a jolly baby as he bumbled around a virtual seashore. In short, it was WhiteGuysWearin’OculusRifts on the cover of a major news magazine that you probably thought had already gone out of business. Funny stuff, right?

But I’m afraid. I’m afraid that Luckey is a harbinger of something more. While Google Glass – an AR device, not a VR device – was rightly ridiculed for being annoying rather than immersive, VR devices like the one Luckey is wearing are far more pernicious. The image of a nerd in VR glasses is funny to us now, but just imagine what will happen when Valve releases Half-Life 3 in VR and we all end up sitting for hours, heads encased in black plastic, as we grunt and gesticulate in our desk chairs. VR devices aren’t meant to be taken to bars so no one will give their wearers a solid punch; instead they will pull our distracted psyches further down the rabbit hole of sub-social Internet behavior as we enclose ourselves in a virtual world.

VR will be important. Barring a direct brain connection it will be the closest representation to true reality that we will ever experience in the electronic age. Beaming photons into our eyes is a great way to connect directly to the brain and we, as visual creatures, will lap it up like cream. I have no doubt that Luckey is really enjoying himself in that photo. He’s probably living in some undersea world where fishes swim about his noggin or fighting over demon hordes in a Tolkein-esque wilderness. Once the experience of strapping something onto your head and wandering around the world becomes commonplace – and it will – we’re all going to look like Luckey.

VR is coming. It’s going to change the way we interact with the world. Parents will look back on the days when their kids just wanted to play Angry Birds on the iPad with wistful nostalgia as their kids cocoon themselves into VR-induced comas. The same guffawing Internet users will find that some things – primarily gaming – are better in VR. And the world will change, once again, as VR becomes easier to use and less goofy. We can laugh all we want but right now remember that we’re chortling from the seat of our horse-drawn buggy as the first Model T chuffs down our country lane.

By the way, Luckey isn’t the first disheveled geek Time put on their cover. Way back in the olden days they stuck a kid named Marc on there – barefoot, polo shirt untucked, mom-jeans acid-washed – and said he and his buddies were the harbinger of a new era. A lot of people were fixated on his feet – a scion of business barefoot! On a throne! Instead they should have been fixated on his ideas.","It could lead to people becoming more isolated from society.

237,Tech Time Warp of the Week: Remembering the Worst 'Virtual Reality' Game System Ever,"Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

When you strapped into the Tiger R-Zone headset, the real world would melt away, leaving you in a full-color, immersive 3-D world. Well, that's what you'd think from commercial embedded above. But the R-Zone's marketing was probably the most egregious example of false advertising in videogame history.

Introduced in 1995, the $30 Tiger R-Zone game console appeared to be a cheaper alternative to Nintendo's own foray into mobile virtual reality gaming, the Virtual Boy. But contrary to what the ads may have implied, the machine didn't feature 3-D graphics at all. Instead it projected simple, two-color graphics that you glimpse only momentarily in the ads. Nor was it immersive: the graphics were projected onto a screen in front of your right eye, while your left eye was free to wander.

Apart from a headset, it didn't have anything in common with virtual reality at all. The device was actually a bizarre wearable videogame console, more of a horrid predecessor to Google Glass than to the Oculus Rift.

Keeping the game industry’s emptiest products in mind may help us avoid getting fooled again.

Today Tiger Electronics is probably best remembered for the Furby and the GigaPet line of ""virtual pets,"" but in the 1980s and 90s, the company was known for a line of cheap portable LCD videogames based on licensed properties, such as successful console or arcade games, or popular films or television shows. Unlike the original Game Boy, each R-Zone game was a stand-alone device that usually cost a bit less than a Game Boy game. They were a quick, cheap fix for videogame junkies, but the game play experience was, shall we say, lacking.

The graphics on these handhelds were incredibly simple. Much like a pocket calculator or digital watch, these games depended on a small number of static shapes that were lit up depending on what was supposed to be happening in the game. If you mashed the screen down, you could actually see all the different pictures.

The R-Zone was similar. The screen for each game was actually built into the cartridge, through which the machine beamed a red light that projected specific images onto a plastic surface that hovered in front of your eye.

Your one eye. Because it was balanced in front of only one eye, you had to cover the other to avoid going cross-eyed. As you can imagine, eye strain was a huge problem. Reviewers also complained about the responsiveness of the controls, and the way the control pad cable dangled in front of your face.","It can cause eye strain.

238,"For Senior Citizens, the Future of VR Lies in the Past","Craig Palmer hasn't left his Manhattan apartment in four years, but on a recent afternoon, the 78-year-old made a transatlantic voyage—while seated upright in his bed. He visited Stonehenge, a favorite vacation site of his; the streets of London's Russell Square, near his old apartment; the stretch of Broadway where he lived and worked for so many years. A singer and actor for most of his career, Palmer was eager to poke his head backstage at the Triad, an Upper West Side nightclub he used to frequent. Back and forth the man moved his head, his eyes obscured by the Gear VR headset he wore.

Sitting at the foot of the bed, Jake Kahana kept a close eye on Palmer, guiding the trip via tablet. Show tunes played quietly in the distance, and car horns blared from a window outside. ""This is awesome,"" Palmer said, tilting his head under the weight of the headset. ""I get homesick for everything."" The experience was among Palmer's first with VR, but that made it no less important. The bedridden man represents a population that Kahana fears has been forgotten by the VR industry: seniors.

""Everyone talks about VR as a millennial thing,"" says Kahana, a New York-based designer and film director. ""But the elderly are the fastest-growing segment of the population, and there really weren't that many people looking at how this could work for them."" Kahana wanted to be one of those people, so he created BettVR With Age, a series of films designed to benefit seniors. The films, which he officially unveils today, are the result of more than 18 months of production, testing and focus groups. ""They want entertainment,"" Kahana says. ""I know this sounds silly, but seniors are just like us.""

Kahana's idea for the project came about through his own struggles in communicating with his own grandmother. First they spoke on the phone, but transitioned to writing letters. When that became too difficult for her, he told her that he wished she could be in his living room in New York—a realization that inspired him Kahana, who worked as the creative director for the Clinton Foundation's Emmy­-nominated VR film Inside Impact: East Africa, to try and find a solution.

Despite precipitous growth in VR research over recent years, less exists around applications for the elderly. However, findings in other fields may hold a clue to VR's benefits. Researchers have learned that listening to music from the 1930s or 1940s can jog memories for Alzheimer's and dementia patients. At Stanford, researchers found that virtual reality simulations had a direct impact on how people behaved in the real world, even after they took off their headsets—in fact, as neuroscientists at UCLA discovered, the part of one's brain that responds to their VR surroundings is different than the part that responds to the real world, raising questions about the new ways in VR it could affect memory.

Given the dearth of literature, Kahana opted for field work. He spent close to six months visiting community centers like DOROT, a senior facility in Manhattan's Upper West Side, talking to seniors about what they might want from a VR experience. (Headsets and phones were donated by Samsung and software by Rendever, an MIT startup focused on bringing VR to the elderly.) His work with the Clinton Foundation had involved grandeur—sweeping vistas, the streets of Nairobi—and he expected that his new audience would also thrill to the possibility__. __Yet, the seniors he spoke with simply missed the everyday experiences they could no longer physically access: museums, concerts, tours. Despite being anxious about using a new technology, Kahana says, the seniors were above all excited. ""They love to learn,"" he says. ""They had these limitations, physical or otherwise, but they still wanted new experiences.""",Seniors may become too reliant on VR to experience life and could miss out on important social interactions.,https://www.wired.com/2017/04/vr-for-seniors/,2017-04-27 15:30:03+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9924989342689514,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
239,Why I've Never Mixed Weed With Virtual Reality,"When I was 17 years old, two things held particular sway over my imagination. One of them was virtual reality. Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash and the movie Lawnmower Man both came out that year, and while I had never heard of the technology that was bubbling through labs and startups thousands of miles from my Midwestern home, the idea of entering and truly existing inside a digital world became a source of endless fascination.

The other thing was—well, the other thing was weed.

First off, yes, obviously. It's one of the great vice-based rites of passage. But smoking unlocked something transformative in my brain. It wasn't necessarily that it rendered aesthetic experiences more vivid (which it did), or that the euphoria that came along with that beat the hell out of most of the other emotions that otherwise define adolescence (which it did). It was that creativity and communication seemed to happen on a different frequency, a range uncluttered by self-consciousness and second guessing.

More than 25 years later, in news that would probably thrill 17-year-old me, both of those things are still part of my life. I've written about VR since it first reemerged in the early part of this decade. I've used it to meditate, to spend time with friends, to travel through space, and sometimes just to watch Netflix in a place that isn't my living room. I have no idea how much time I've spent inside a headset, but between the exotic and the pedestrian it's likely enough to qualify for dual citizenship with the metaverse.

As for cannabis: hell, it's California. In New York, I had a delivery guy who kept his inventory in a fake tennis-ball can. Here, I can walk into a store, browse a laminated menu, and walk out with any one of dozens of strains, optimized for whatever mood or medium I prefer. You have a glass of wine with dinner, I have a little Gelato with some added terpenes. (Operative term here being ""a little."" I'm not 17 anymore.) I've used it to meditate, to spend time with friends, to travel through—you get it.

So it's with great trepidation that on this, the holiest most annoying of days, that I unburden myself: I have never used VR while high. Never even considered it, despite their seemingly synergistic natures. And even though this pattern established itself organically, I've come to realize that it distills everything I think (and fear) about immersive technologies, and about the age of simulated experience that they herald.

As our screens and speakers and computers got better and better over the last 50 years, each new wrinkle brought with it an unspoken cultural dare: That high-def TV is cool, but did you ever watch it … on weed? Surround Sound, IMAX screens as tall as your apartment building, Pixar and ILM wizardry that made the impossible real. The draw wasn't in a bigger, louder, sharper experience—it was how much more mind-blowing it would be in conjunction with tetrahydrocannabinol. Then flat screens gave way to something much, much realer, and the calculation changed considerably.",The most unintended consequence of virtual reality is that people are now able to use it while under the influence of drugs.

In each game, players wandered around a medieval castle and used a virtual arm (controlled by a wireless game pad) to either find and crush floating cigarettes or grasp virtual balls. At the end of the three months, 15% of those in the cigarette-crushing group said they had cut down on smoking (as measured by carbon monoxide levels in an exhale test), compared to 2% of the ball-grasping group.

Aside from better smoking abstinence, those who played the cigarette-crushing game also reported having lower nicotine cravings.

The researchers speculate that crushing virtual cigarettes may help smokers feel more confident about quitting. The game may have also help players associate crushing cigarettes with the feeling of winning.

It would be interesting to know if a regular video game would have a similar effect, or if a more immersive virtual reality experience is crucial.",Virtual reality has the potential to be addictive.

241,Sen. Franken wants to know what Oculus is doing with its Rift user data,"Sen. Franken wants to know what Oculus is doing with its Rift user data

Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) has some questions for Oculus.

The U.S. senator sent a letter this morning to Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe to inquire about how his virtual reality company is utilizing and sharing customers’ personal data.

While Sen. Franken called VR technology “an exciting development,” he also expressed concern with how the company is collecting users’ personal data through the headset and its associated services. This letter, he said, is intended to help people “understand the extent to which Oculus may be collecting Americans’ personal information, including sensitive location data, and sharing that information with third parties.”

Numerous complaints from users and media outlets have arisen over the past week regarding specific language within the Terms of Service (ToS) for the Rift. From seemingly creepy stipulations that the company reserves the rights to collect user movement data, to the always-on gathering of user data, there have been a great deal of pertinent questions that the company has stayed relatively quiet on.

Oculus did clarify to Gizmodo earlier this week that language in the ToS was being misconstrued in regards to ownership rights of user-created content, but didn’t respond to other concerns.

“Users and content developers own all the content and IP they create using Oculus services. We are not taking ownership. Our terms of service give Oculus a license to user created content so we can enable a full suite of current and future products and services on our platform, like sharing a piece of VR content with a friend.”

Franken’s individual questions largely focus on some of the more vague sets of language in the ToS regarding user data being gathered and shared. He asks Iribe about how user location data, physical movement data and communication data are utilized and how long the information is retained. Furthermore, Franken presses the company to disclose what precautions are being taken to protect these selections of user data.

One word that is notably absent from the letter is “Facebook.” Though Oculus, like Instagram, operates as a unique company under Facebook, there have been more than a fair share of privacy concerns regarding how information is shared between the VR company and the social media giant. Franken does not directly call out Facebook in this letter to Iribe, but he does frequently refer to Oculus’ “related companies.”

Virtual reality as a technological platform raises more ethical questions than the average piece of hardware, thus, some of these early consumer products are understandably drawing major scrutiny. Sen. Franken seems to want Oculus to set a precedent of transparency while virtual reality is still in its early stages.

I believe Americans have a fundamental right to privacy, and that right includes an individual s access to information about what data are being collected about them, how the data are being treated, and with whom the data are being shared. As virtual reality technology evolves, I ask that you provide more information on Rift and how Oculus is addressing issues of privacy and security.

The senator ends his letter with a request that the company responds to his list of questions by May 13 of this year. Franken has had a history of pressing tech companies for transparency in regards to their usages of users’ personal data. Hopefully a response from Oculus can allay some user concerns or highlight areas in the company’s current Terms of Service that may need some adjustment.

If you’re curious, here’s the full text of Sen. Franken’s letter and questions.","One of the unintended consequences of virtual reality being discussed in the article is the potential for virtual reality companies to collect and share users' personal data without their knowledge or consent.

242,VR Cops Brag About Planting Fake Evidence in Metaverse While Disguised as Underage Girls,"""I can pull out a bag of weed and make it look like it came out of someone’s pocket.""

Let’s Be Cops

Turns out cops in the metaverse can be just as corrupt — and not to mention creepy — as real world ones. At least that’s the case with a group of users on the metaverse platform VRChat who have created a police force to question, arrest, and occasionally frame other users for crimes.

Oh, and they do it while using avatars of underaged female anime characters. Yikes, right?

The Loli Police Department (LPD), disturbingly named for the slang internet term for underaged and often sexualized female anime characters, boasts nearly 11,000 members on its Discord server, Input reports. Founded in 2018 as a joke, the group has grown to be the most popular police roleplay community on VRChat.

“We have two-hour patrols where we break up into squads, go out into the world of VRChat, and interact with people to start roleplays,” a Scottish computer science student who participates in the weird roleplay told Input. Jura is a sergeant in the LPD and even runs a training program for new recruits.

Virtual Corruption

“Officers” in the LPD spend their time harassing various people on the platform, investigating crimes, and occasionally arresting people. Some members have even admitted to planting evidence to fabricate reasons for arrests — just like actual cops.

“I can pull out a bag of weed and make it look like it came out of someone’s pocket,” Karet, an LPD captain from Texas, told the site. “They always say it’s not theirs.”

VR ACAB

Though the loli imagery is troubling, no one is actually getting arrested or hurt by a users larping as cops on the metaverse. However, the LPD do occasionally encounter pushback from users who harbor anti-police sentiments.

“We absolutely get abuse,” another LPD member told Input. “Especially when there’s police violence going on in the US. We get a lot more people responding and saying curse words to us, like ‘Fuck the police.’”

On the one hand, the phenomenon is a quirky example of the ways the metaverse can allow us to truly transform who we are. On the other, the whole thing seems to be soaked in some sort of ironic-or-maybe-not joke about pedophilia.

One thing’s for sure: there’s already stuff unfolding on the metaverse that’s so weird, dark, and unexpected that nothing would surprise us going forward.

243,Defuse a Bomb With Friends in This Brilliant Oculus Game,"SEATTLE -- It's a typical action-movie cliche. Someone has to disarm a bomb, but they know nothing about how to do it. Fortunately, they have a bomb-defusal expert---on the phone. Hijinks ensue as the expert tries to talk the newbie through the delicate process.

Admit it, you've always wanted to do this in real life. This new Oculus game gives you that chance.

On the show floor at Penny Arcade Expo, currently taking place in Seattle through Monday evening, a small table with easily-missable signage hosts the demo version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, currently in development for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. It's so early in development that the team, three guys who met in the Ottawa game development scene, doesn't even have a name yet. But they've got a corker of a proof-of-concept. It's easily the most exciting new idea I found at PAX.

Keep Talking got its start when Ottawa area indie developers Allen Pestaluky, Ben Kane and Brian Fetter worked together on a Global Game Jam project in January of this year. The idea came from an episode of the animated show Archer that had a bomb-disarming bit, Pestaluky says. ""They were trying to communicate back and forth, and all of these silly things came up when they were talking, trying to defuse the bomb.""

Within a week, a YouTube video of their Game Jam version, created over a single weekend, had racked up over 150,000 views, Pestaluky said. Since then, they've been working on the game full-time, and plan to release it on the day that the consumer version of the Oculus becomes available---whenever that is.

Keep Talking consists of two separate but inextricable pieces: the Oculus Rift software, and a paper manual sitting on the demo table in a three-hole notebook. The bomb that players see on screen is composed of any number of different modules, each of which is a miniature puzzle: a series of colored wires, an array of lights, or maybe just a big red button that reads ""PRESS.""","It could potentially lead to people becoming more isolated from one another.

244,The HoloLens 2 Puts a Full-Fledged Computer on Your Face,"If you ask Alex Kipman to name the most significant advancement in the brand-new version of HoloLens, Microsoft’s mixed-reality headset, he’ll say the answer is yes. It's not an evasion of the question—it's evidence of his excitement.

Kipman, Microsoft’s technical fellow for AI and mixed reality, gets excited about “all of the things” in the HoloLens 2. When pressed, though, it comes down to three key improvements: It's more comfortable, it’s more immersive, and it offers more out-of-box value than the first HoloLens. Kipman uttered this mantra—“comfort, immersion, out-of-box value”—frequently during my day-long visit to Microsoft's headquarters last month, like someone who had been well coached by his communications staff. Later, when an editor asked me what was new about the new HoloLens 2, I realized the mantra was still rattling in my brain, as though it had been transmitted through the headgear.

The new HoloLens 2 is more comfortable than the first headset, and more immersive. Its diagonal field of view has more than doubled, with Microsoft wielding a new kind of patented imaging technology. It has an AI processing unit and now connects to Azure, Microsoft’s cloud service.

Alex Kipman, Microsoft’s technical fellow for AI and mixed reality, wearing the HoloLens 2 Quinn Russell Brown

Whether the $3,500 headset provides more out-of-box value is a call for its commercial customers to make. This isn’t a headset you’ll use for gaming or for sending interactive poop emoji to friends, or one that the average consumer will ever wear at all. It’s not for “knowledge workers” like me and Kipman, people who sit at their desks all day, he says. It’s for people whose jobs are being digitally transformed—people who work in design or manufacturing, who fix gear shifts and work on oil rigs, military personnel.

Try to forget, for a second, that HoloLens is a headset. Kipman thinks about it more as a full-fledged computer for a futuristic world of remote workers in need of expertise. And Microsoft is determined to make it the most advanced mixed-reality computer out there. That much is clear, even if all of the use cases for it haven’t crystallized yet.

HoloLens History

To grasp the significance of HoloLens 2, it helps to know its origin. The earliest seeds for HoloLens were planted as far back as 11 years ago. It was borne out of Kinect, the Xbox peripheral product that used a variety of sensors to compute depth maps and recognize humans within its field of view. Kipman is credited with inventing Kinect, and in 2010, he began channeling some of the Kinect's technology into a head-mounted holographic computer. It was known then as Project Baraboo, but it would later become HoloLens.

When HoloLens officially launched in 2016, it was a 1.3-pound head-mounted display with depth-sensing cameras and an optical projection system that beamed holographic images directly into your eyes. While wearing one, you might see anything from a floating web browser to a cartoon fish in a bathtub to a three-dimensional motorcycle—all while still seeing the real world around you. Or you might see a remote technician pop up in your eye frame and show you how to fix a light switch. It isn’t a consumer device now, and it certainly wasn’t then, but Microsoft was trying to show off a wide variety of applications that could be easily grasped by regular people.

LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Virtual Reality

The HoloLens was available only to developers when it first launched, since Microsoft wanted to spur development of new apps. (No AR or VR headset is worth the money without compelling apps; that was true then and is still true now.) Later that year, a version of HoloLens started shipping to any consumer in the US or Canada who had $3,000 to spend.

The first HoloLens wasn’t a “success” in the way that you might describe the success of other technology products, whether that’s based on sales, ecosystem lock-in, or pure cachet. In some ways, it wasn’t meant to be a blockbuster hit in a public-facing way. But it was the first mixed-reality wearable that ran on a holographic-specific operating system—and it wasn’t a pair of lightweight smart glasses. It was an untethered headset running Windows 10, which meant it was an actual working face computer.

Still, early customers had their complaints: It was heavy, it was unwieldy, it didn’t feel immersive enough. And Microsoft heard them, loud and clear.

Put Your Heads Together

One of the most obvious updates to HoloLens 2 is its build. The first HoloLens was front-heavy, a whole bunch of components loaded onto your forehead. For this new version, Microsoft split up the pieces, positioning the lenses and some computing power in the front and moving the rest of it to the back.

Microsoft’s senior director of design, Carl Ledbetter, calls this a split-architecture design. It came loaded with its own engineering challenges, because cables had to run between the front and back parts of the headset. These are now built into the arms of HoloLens 2. Ledbetter says this new form factor was critical to achieving a certain level of comfort and balance on the new model. “With HoloLens version one, there were just a lot of things we didn’t know we didn’t know,” Ledbetter says as he leads me around Microsoft’s Human Factors lab. “But luckily, since it’s been out there for three years, we’ve been able to talk to a lot of customers.”",The unintended consequence of virtual reality being discussed in the above article is that it may lead to a disconnection from the real world. People who use virtual reality headsets may become so immersed in the virtual world that they forget about the real world around them.

245,Better Than Opioids? Virtual Reality Could Be Your Next Painkiller,"Virtual reality has long been studied for its potential to ease pain by serving as a distracting force during medical procedures like wound care sessions for burn victims. Yet typically the equipment needed to bring virtual reality into hospitals (or anywhere else, for that matter) has been extremely pricey: Hunter Hoffman, director of the virtual reality research center at the University of Washington’s Human Photonics Laboratory and a developer of a pain control game called SnowWorld, says the VR equipment he’s using as part of an intensive care unit pain-relief study costs $35,000.

With cheaper headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR, Oculus’s Rift, and HTC’s Vive now on the market, though, it’s a lot easier for hospitals and doctors to consider using them for their patients, and a number of startups including AppliedVR see a business opportunity. AppliedVR sells its service—the VR content plus a Gear VR headset— to customers for far more than the $100 you’d pay for a Gear VR plus the price of a compatible high-end Samsung smartphone, but still much less than virtual-reality devices have cost in the past. It declined to disclose the exact pricing.

AppliedVR is working with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center—an investor in the company—and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, which are conducting studies using its software. One study that Cedars-Sinai recently completed but hasn’t yet published had a group of 60 patients with a range of medical conditions (things like abdominal pain from pancreatitis or chest pain from pneumonia) use AppliedVR-provided content including a game called Bear Blast, in which the player moves his head to throw balls at cartoon bears.

The game, which I tried out in my office, is pretty simple and seems purposely mesmerizing: you constantly move forward at a slow pace through a virtual world filled with bears and lob balls at as many of them as possible to earn points. Unlike most games, you can’t get hurt or die.

Brennan Spiegel, who directs health services research at Cedars-Sinai, says researchers found that 20 minutes with the virtual-reality software reduced patients’ pain by 24 percent on average; before using VR the patients had a mean pain score of roughly 5.5 on a zero to 10 scale, he says, and afterward it averaged 4.

“That’s a pretty dramatic reduction for an acute pain,” he says. “It’s not too different from what we see from giving narcotics.”

Now, Spiegel says, Cedars-Sinai is going to conduct a controlled trial where some patients get virtual-reality headsets that they can use whenever they want during their hospital stay and others don’t.

Spiegel is cautiously optimistic about virtual reality’s prospects for helping reduce patients’ discomfort. He thinks the technology could be beneficial to people who are in pain or, at the least, could use some help with relaxation, both in the hospital and after they go home. But, he says, it won’t help everyone, and a lot more data has to be gathered before it will be clear if it’s truly useful.

Elliot Krane, chief of pediatric pain management at Stanford Children’s Health, also thinks VR’s power for distracting could be valuable for, say, helping kids with physical therapy and getting them to stay still during imaging studies. To him, the biggest challenge right now is finding software developers who want to make applications that target specific medical problems—something AppliedVR says it wants to do to grow its catalog of content.

Spiegel points out that it’s also important to figure out when the technology can be helpful and when it isn’t the right approach. He remembers trying to convince a patient whose cancer had spread that she could put on a headset and be transported, virtually, to Iceland; she looked at him like he was crazy, he says.

“We have to be careful about not overselling virtual reality, or any other digital technology,” he says.

246,"UN Launches Powerful, First Ever, VR Film following Syrian Refugee Girl","A young girl, a Syrian refugee, suddenly appears before you, sitting on the floor of a cramped room. She describes her family, and takes you on a journey through the refugee camp in which she lives. You sit beside her in her makeshift school classroom and watch children tramp through the muddy streets in the encampment. You feel as if you can smell the bread being baked in front of you at the camp’s bakery. This is the powerful, immersive and deeply moving experience invoked by a ground-breaking new film shot for the United Nations using the Samsung Gear VR 360-degree platform, which is a collaboration between Samsung and Oculus. As a way to create empathy with a subject, it’s definitely a harbinger of things to come.

Fashion model Mari Malek (pictured below), former Harry Potter star Emma Watson, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg were among the dignitaries at the World Economic Forum in Davos today backing the launch the new film, shot specifically for the Samsung Gear VR.

“Clouds Over Sidra” follows a twelve-year-old girl named Sidra in the Za’atari camp in Jordan — currently home to 84,000 refugees from the bloody Syrian civil war.

It’s the first ever film shot in virtual reality for the UN and is designed to support the UN’s campaign to highlight the plight of vulnerable communities, particularly refugees. The film is released today on the VRSE channel on Samsung Milk VR USA as well as the VRSE application on iTunes and Google Play. Samsung Milk VR is like a content delivery system for Gear VR, a little like a ‘YouTube for VR’.

You’ll be able to experience the film on a virtual-reality headset, like the Oculus Rift device or via the Vrse app, which operates on a smartphone in conjunction with a simple viewer, like the cardboard one that Google has designed. You can also download the app and watch it on a phone, but you won’t get the full 360 Degrees immersive experience.

Created by UN adviser Gabo Arora and filmmaker Chris Milk using VRSE.tools, the film was produced by Samantha Storr, and is a collaboration between the UN Millennium Campaign and UNICEF Jordan.

Right now the number of refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people is at the highest it has ever been since World War II. Over fifty percent of them are children.

I watched the movie myself and interviewed the producer, Socrates Kakoulides.

It had a powerful effect on me as you can see from the below video.","It could potentially desensitize people to real life suffering. If people are constantly exposed to virtual reality simulations of poverty, war, and suffering, they may become immune to the real thing.

247,This guy combined an iPhone and an HTC Vive to make a virtual camera (sort of like the ones used for...,"This guy combined an iPhone and an HTC Vive to make a virtual camera (sort of like the ones used for Avatar and Inside Out)

When a movie is more CG than it is real — think movies like Avatar or any of Pixar’s stuff, where all or nearly all of the environment is rendered — a new challenge appears: the camera.

Getting a fake camera (like the one in a rendering program) to move and behave like a real camera (like the one that the camera guy is traditionally holding) can be a pain. Testing a scene from a whole different angle is less “hey, let’s try that again real quick and I’ll shoot it from over there,” and more “hey, let’s tear open keyframes and rework a bunch of carefully set parameters.”

James Cameron and the folks at Pixar have been solving this with “virtual cameras” — physical camera-like devices that let videographers shoot fully virtual scenes much like they would shoot any scene in the real world. They tie a simulated camera to the movements/orientation of a real-world camera proxy, and push everything the simulated camera “sees” back to a display on its real-world counterpart in real time.

As you might expect, these virtual camera rigs are… not cheap.

Kert Gartner, the VFX artist behind the REALLY, REALLY good mixed-reality trailers for VR games like Space Pirate Trainer and Fantastic Contraption, has hacked together a solution of his own:

VR in-game Virtual Cinematography just got a whole lot easier!! Check this out #thefuture :D pic.twitter.com/dJKL6jMRIM — Kert Gartner (@kertgartner) December 21, 2016

So what are you looking at?

Kert is having Space Pirate Trainer render another view of the game to a second camera, independent of the player’s, in one corner of his screen. He’s using an open source project called jsmpeg-vnc to push what this camera sees to his iPhone in near real time. Meanwhile, he’s using a third HTC Vive controller (beyond the two the player uses for the game) to capture the location and orientation of the rig, and is using that to control the aforementioned in-game camera view. Strap the iPhone and an HTC Vive controller to a handheld stabilizer and bam! — he’s got a virtual camera built out of gear he already had lying around.

It doesn’t look like it does all the crazy stuff the Cameron/Pixar rigs do — those can do stuff like tweaking the simulated F-stop and focus (which would have to be accounted for at a software level in every game/environment with a rig like this in mind, which complicates things a good bit). But for a project hacked together out of existing components, this is awesome — and hopefully, just the first step.","The possibility of people becoming addicted to virtual reality and neglecting their real lives.

248,Avegant's Glyph Headset Is a Movie Theater for Your Face,"When I put on the Glyph, the $699 headphones-meets-face-computer headset Avegant's been working on, Ed Tang didn't put on a game. Avegant's founder and chief strategy officer didn't drop me in some immersive other world, where I could look around and explore or interact with a robot.

He put on The Avengers.

The Glyph looks like a VR headset, but it's not a VR headset. It also looks like an overgrown pair of Beats headphones, but it's not an overgrown pair of Beats headphones. It's something else. Avegant calls it ""Mediawear,"" which is terrible. It amounts to this: a pair of great-sounding headphones, with two eyepieces on the underside of the band. Flip it down over your eyes, and suddenly it's like you're sitting dead center in your own movie theater. It's kinda like Oculus Rift meets Bose meets holding your phone inches from your face. After years of development, a $1.5 million Kickstarter campaign, and lots of user testing, Avegant is getting ready to ship the Glyph this spring.

I first saw the Glyph almost exactly two years ago. It was a mess of circuitry and plastic ties, like futuristic sunglasses someone might wear in a campy 1950s sci-fi flick. All Avegant had was concept art and a line about it looking like a pair of headphones. Now it's far slicker than even the concept art, thought it still looks like a pair of headphones. The cans go over your ears, and the band rests on your nose via an interchangeable nosepad. (User testing revealed that people have crazy-different noses, so the Glyph ships with four options.) It looks silly, like you're wearing a crappy Geordi La Forge costume, but Avegant is betting we'll all be comfortable wearing face-computers soon enough. It's probably right.

Put it on, adjust the two eyepieces to suit your vision, spin the dial on the lens to match your prescription if you have one, then sit back and watch. It's almost boring, in a way—it really is just a screen on your face.

Let me say this one more time: It's not a VR headset. It's not designed to take over your entire field of vision and make you feel like you're somewhere else. Maybe it's meant for travelers who want a better screen than the scratched and smudged slap of polycarbonate on the back of 17D. Rather than build something you play while sitting on your couch, Avegant's trying to build something you can take out into the world.

Whatever you watch in the Glyph takes up the same amount of your view that a 65-inch TV in your living room does, or the huge screen in a theater. But you can look down and see your hands, or up and see the sky. This helps keep your eyes from tiring, and prevents some of the motion-sickness virtual reality has dealt with. It's a personal movie theater, the headphones and screen giving you a private and high-end experience.",Virtual reality has the potential to cause motion sickness in some users.,https://www.wired.com/2015/12/avegant-glyph-is-a-different-kind-of-face-computer/,2015-12-15 14:00:54+00:00,LABEL_1_relevant,0.9908838868141174,Virtual Reality,virtual_reality,Wired,User Experience & Entertainment
249,Google's Improbable Deal to Recreate the Real World in VR,"Let a thousand virtual worlds rain down from the clouds. Or rather, the cloud. That's the call from Google as it gets behind a tiny British startup called Improbable.

Founded by two Cambridge graduates and backed by $20 million in funding from the venture capitalists at Andreessen Horowitz, Improbable offers a new way of building virtual worlds, including not just immersive games à la Second Life or World of Warcraft, but also vast digital simulations of real cities, economies, and biological systems. The idea is that these virtual worlds can run in a holistic way across a practically infinite network of computers, so that they can expand to unprecedented sizes and reach new levels of complexity.

So far, the startup has shared its technology with just a handful of coders and companies. But today, Improbable joined forces with Google to offer its creation, called SpatialOS, to anyone who wants it.

You can think of SpatialOS as a cloud computing service for building virtual worlds, whether they run on desktop computers or VR rigs like the Oculus Rift. This service runs atop the Google Cloud Platform, the tech giant's growing cloud computing empire, and the two companies just opened a SpatialOS alpha program that lets coders prototype and test their own virtual worlds. When the beta launches in the first quarter of next year, a separate program will provide coders with free time on Google's cloud as they hone these virtual worlds for release onto the internet at large.

On one level, this partnership allows Google to promote its cloud services as it challenges rivals like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. In providing of the cloud infrastructure that underpins Pokemon Go, Google has seen the thirst for virtual and augmented reality firsthand, and now, with Improbable, it hopes to push even further into this burgeoning market. But this partnership also points to something bigger down the road: the future of AI.

As developers build more complex virtual worlds, this provides AI researchers with better ways of training the next generation of artificial intelligence. Games have long offered a proving ground for AI, but SpatialOS can help expand this proving ground, providing a way not only for AI agents to learn the successor to Second Life, but to navigate real city streets or even trace the path of contagious disease.

If AI agents set loose in virtual simulations of the real world sounds like Gibsonian science fiction, consider Universe, an AI training ground just recently unveiled by OpenAI, the lab bootstrapped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Y Combinator president Sam Altman. Universe is a software platform where researchers can train AI agents to use any application, from games to web browsers to protein folding simulations---anything humans can do on a computer. In theory, you could train agents to navigate any of the beefed-up virtual worlds built with Improbable.

That opens AI research to a few frontier. Game designers Dean Hall (creator of Day Z) and Henrique Olifiers (CEO of Bossa Studios, maker of World Adrift) say Improbable allows massively multiplayer games to achieve unprecedented complexity and scale. And in an effort to understand the impact of autonomous cars, a UK startup called Immense Simulations is using the service to model entire cities. ""We can cover really large geographical areas,"" says CEO Robin North, ""but still keep a high level of detail.""

In the end, such simulations could also provide training grounds for those autonomous cars. Craig Quiter, an engineer at Otto, the robo-vehicle company owned by Uber, is training AI agents on Grand Theft Auto as a stepping stone to more advanced self-driving cars. Swap Grand Theft Auto for a simulation of the city of Manchester, and you get even closer to that goal.

Improbable CEO Herman Narula stresses that today his service is mainly a way of building games. But he too sees it as a path to better AI, hinting that his company is already working with others toward this goal. If a thousand virtual worlds take shape, so too can a thousand AIs.","The potential for AI agents to learn and navigate real world city streets and even trace the path of contagious disease.
